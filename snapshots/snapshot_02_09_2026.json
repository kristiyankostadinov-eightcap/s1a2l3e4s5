So gold looks to me kind of like a classical, speculative blowoff.\u201d\nBessent was responding to a question about a record-breaking rally in precious metals \u2013 fuelled by speculative buying, geopolitical turmoil and concern about the US Federal Reserve\u2019s independence \u2013 that abruptly reversed last week.\nThe turmoil helped lift the US dollar to its first weekly gain since early January while the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 50,000 for the first time, reflecting investor optimism about the US economy and corporate earnings.\nWith midterm elections coming in November, Bessent cited the Dow Jones record as evidence that the US economy is headed for an upward cycle that will benefit ordinary Americans.\nOn Federal Reserve policy, Bessent said that he expects the central bank to move cautiously in any effort to trim its balance sheet.\nNavigate Asia in\na new global order\nGet the insights delivered to your inbox.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect them to do anything quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have moved to the ample-regime policy, and that does require a larger balance sheet, so I would think that they will probably sit back, take at least a year to decide what they want to do.\u201d\nUS President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to become the next Federal Reserve chair, Kevin Warsh, \u201cis going to be very independent, but mindful that the Fed is accountable to the American people\u201d, Bessent said.\nDuring a Senate hearing on Thursday (Feb 5), Bessent told lawmakers it would be up to Trump whether to sue Warsh if he failed to lower interest rates as Trump prefers.\nPressed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Bessent said that the remark stemmed from a joke Trump made, defended Warsh\u2019s qualifications and highlighted Trump\u2019s expectation that the Fed nominee align with his views on interest rates.

Inflation data from China, Germany and India will also be tracked, along with speeches by US Federal Reserve officials for signals on the timing of possible rate cuts and their impact on bullion prices.\nGold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?\n\"Gold consolidation and recovery suggest that bias still remains positive. However, in case of silver, we remain cautious of volatility and further corrections,\" Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services told PTI.\nDuring the past week, gold futures rose Rs 7,698, or 5.2 per cent, while silver fell Rs 15,760, or nearly 6 per cent, on the Multi Commodity Exchange. The commodities market remained open on Sunday due to the presentation of the Union Budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\"Gold and silver endured an extremely volatile week as a sharp dollar rebound, shifting Fed expectations and aggressive position unwinding triggered one of the steepest corrections in decades,\" Manav Modi, Analyst - Commodities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL), said.\nHe said easing tensions between Washington and Tehran, progress in tariff negotiations by President Donald Trump and reduced risk of a US government shutdown lowered safe-haven premiums, while Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination as the next Fed Chair also led traders to scale back aggressive rate-cut expectations.\n\"The unwind was severe: gold recorded its sharpest decline in nearly four decades, while silver languished, amplified by heavy call option positioning, margin calls and speculative driven liquidation,\" Modi noted.\nDomestic markets also saw volatility. While the Union Budget largely met expectations with no sector-specific surprises, bullion remained volatile amid rupee swings. A softer USD/INR following progress on a potential trade deal between New Delhi and Washington weighed on local bullion prices.\nDespite the sharp selloff, Modi said signs of stabilisation emerged as forced liquidation eased and value buying returned across both metals.\n\"A sharp rebound followed, aided by weaker economic data and value buying after a near 15 per cent correction in gold,\" he said, adding that domestic gains were further supported by a rebound in USD/INR from recent lows.\nIn global markets, gold rose $234.7, or nearly 5 per cent, over the past week on Comex, recovering to about $5,000 per ounce from a low of $4,400 per ounce.\n\"There has not been much change in the fundamentals, as geopolitical uncertainty still prevails. Central banks and ETFs investors continue to add gold to their holdings, while crypto firms have also increased buying to create & trade gold tokens, backed by physical assets,\" Mer said.\nHowever, silver futures remained under pressure, slipping $1.63, or 2.08 per cent.\n\"Volatility grips silver as prices pass through a phase of high swings after the parabolic rally that ended on January 30 with a flash crash from an all-time high around $121 to a recent low of $64 per ounce,\" Mer added.\nAccording to Modi, physical demand from China ahead of the Lunar New Year has remained resilient and could help absorb further selling.\n\"Broader fundamentals still support bullion through 2026, driven by central bank buying, fiscal concerns and geopolitical risks, though near-term volatility is likely to remain elevated,\" he said.\nAnalysts said macroeconomic data and remarks from Fed officials are expected to drive market direction next week, with traders anticipating continued volatility but also opportunities for short-term buying on dips, particularly i"

                "body": "Gold, Silver Prices Today Live Updates: Yellow Metal Recovers in International Market; Spot Gold Up Over 1%\nRenewed safe-haven demand, softer dollar, and shifting rate expectations lift precious metals as investors reassess global risks\nGold prices staged a notable recovery in international markets, climbing more than 1% in spot trading, as investors returned to safe-haven assets amid a complex mix of economic signals and geopolitical uncertainty. Silver prices also firmed, tracking gold\u2019s upward momentum while drawing additional support from industrial demand expectations. The rebound follows a period of consolidation in precious metals, during which traders weighed resilient economic data against the prospect of easing monetary conditions later in the year.\nWhat\u2019s Driving Gold\u2019s Comeback?\nThe primary catalyst behind gold\u2019s rebound has been a softer U.S. dollar and a pullback in global bond yields. When the dollar weakens, gold becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies, often boosting demand. At the same time, easing yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, making the yellow metal more attractive to investors.\nMarket participants are also recalibrating expectations around central bank policy. While inflation in several major economies remains sticky, recent data points suggest growth may be moderating. This has revived speculation that major central banks could pivot toward rate cuts later in the year if economic conditions soften further. Such expectations tend to support gold prices, as lower interest rates typically enhance the appeal of precious metals.\nGeopolitical developments have added another layer of support. Persistent tensions in key regions, coupled with uncertainty around global trade and energy routes, have kept risk sentiment fragile. In times of heightened uncertainty, gold\u2019s role as a store of value and hedge against volatility comes back into focus.\nSilver Rides the Wave\u2014With an Industrial Twist\nSilver prices moved higher alongside gold, though the drivers are slightly more nuanced. Often described as a hybrid metal, silver straddles the line between precious and industrial commodities. While it benefits from safe-haven flows during periods of uncertainty, it is also heavily influenced by expectations for industrial activity, particularly in sectors such as electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles.\nOptimism around medium-term industrial demand has helped silver outperform at times, especially as governments worldwide continue to invest in renewable energy and electrification. Any sign of stabilization in global manufacturing data can quickly translate into stronger silver prices. As gold regained momentum, silver followed suit, reflecting improved sentiment across the precious metals complex.\nInflation, Rates, and the Bigger Picture\nInflation remains a key variable for precious metals. Although headline inflation has eased from recent peaks in many economies, core inflation components are proving more stubborn. This has put central banks in a delicate position: tighten policy too much and risk slowing growth sharply, or ease too soon and risk reigniting inflation.\nFor gold investors, this balancing act creates opportunity. Gold is traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge, but it also performs well during periods of economic uncertainty or financial stress. The current environment\u2014characterized by mixed data, policy ambiguity, and geopolitical risks\u2014ticks many of the boxes that historically support gold prices.\nSilver, meanwhile, is more sensitive to the growth outlook. If economic data deteriorates significantly, silver could face short-term pressure due to reduced industrial demand. However, longer-term structural trends, particularly in clean energy, continue to underpin a constructive outlook.\nMarket Sentiment and Technical Levels\nFrom a technical perspective, gold\u2019s move higher has helped it reclaim key support levels that traders had been closely watc"

The grey metal advances amid market caution ahead of key US economic data that could provide clearer guidance on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) interest-rate outlook. The January jobs report, due Wednesday, is expected to signal stabilization in the labor market, with the US economy forecast to add 70,000 jobs, while the Unemployment Rate is seen holding steady at 4.4%.\nMarkets currently expect the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged in March, with potential rate cuts anticipated in June and possibly September. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in a LinkedIn post on Friday that the economy may remain in a low-hiring, low-firing environment, though it could also shift toward a no-hiring, higher-firing phase.\nFed Governor Phillip Jefferson said future policy decisions will be guided by incoming data and assessments of the economic outlook, adding on Friday that the labor market is gradually stabilizing. Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic noted that inflation has remained elevated for too long, stressing in a Bloomberg interview on Friday that the Fed cannot lose sight of inflationary risks.\nSilver, a traditional hedge against inflation, finds support following the landslide victory of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s ruling coalition in Japan\u2019s weekend elections. This result strengthens the case for expansionary fiscal policies. Such policies tend to lift inflation expectations, underpinning demand for the precious metal.\nSafe-haven demand for Silver also remains resilient despite the United States (US)\u2013Iran talks held in Oman on Friday aimed at easing regional tensions. However, Tehran reiterated that it would not suspend nuclear fuel enrichment, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi noting that further negotiations depend on consultations in Washington and Tehran and must proceed without threats. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said another round of talks is planned this week, warning of \u201cvery steep\u201d consequences if an agreement is not reached.\n(The story was corrected on February 9 at 2:40 GMT to say in the title that XAG/USD holds gains near $80.50 on Japan-led reflationary trades, and not on the Japanese election.)\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest elect"

                "body": "Oil Servicers Look to Middle East for Growth\nThe world\u2019s largest oilfield-service providers are looking to production increases in the Middle East to help offset a slowdown in US shale.\nThat\u2019s one of the big takeaways from comments this week made by executives at Helmerich & Payne Inc. and Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., who pointed to opportunities in countries such as Saudi Arabia to help drive growth. The comments echoed outlooks from some of the biggest names in the industry, including SLB and Weatherford International Plc, who expect the Middle East to lead a rebound in activity for the end of 2026 through 2027.\nOperators in the US shale patch, once the world\u2019s leader in oil production growth, are now closely watching commodity markets as they hover near the level that makes drilling profitable for producers. If crude prices drop into the low $50-per-barrel range for several months, companies are expected to make more drastic cuts to drilling and fracking in the US.\nGlobal oil prices have steadily declined in the past several months on expectations of a glut. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has fallen more than 10% over the past year, trading around $63 a barrel on Thursday.\nBut some producers in the Middle East can better sustain the lower crude prices, which underscores why the oilfield-services companies are looking there for growth. Projects to frack for natural gas have also emerged in the region, as governments face rising electricity demand, industrial expansion and petrochemical build-outs.\nHere\u2019s a look at recent comments from oilfield-services companies:\nHelmerich & Payne\n- One of the top drilling-rig contractors on the US shale patch, the company said the reactivation of its suspended rigs in Saudi Arabia is underway.\n- On an earnings call Thursday, incoming Chief Executive Officer Trey Adams said the company remains hopeful for further opportunities in the region\nPatterson-UTI Energy\n- The company opened a drill bit manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia that started operations in December, CEO Andy Hendricks said in a call discussing fourth-quarter results Thursday.\nSLB\n- A rebound in oil production driven by OPEC+ policy and gas becoming a priority to meet regional demand will lead to a \u201cfavorable\u201d next few years, SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch said during an earnings call on Jan. 23.\n- \u201cThe Middle East market will be characterized by rebounds in drilling and workover activity in Saudi Arabia, with rig counts potentially returning to early 2025 levels by the end of 2026, and this has already begun,\u201d Le Peuch said.\nWeatherford\n- Weatherford International, which gets a lot of its business from the Middle East/North Africa region, sees a \u201cstrong opportunity\u201d in Saudi Arabia and momentum in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman, CEO Girish Saligram said during an earnings call Wednesday.\nHalliburton\n- Halliburton Co., the world\u2019s biggest provider of fracking services, took a more cautious view, with the company estimating activity in the region being flat or down slightly in 2026, CEO Jeff Miller said during an earnings call on Jan. 21.\n- \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the activity growth in Saudi Arabia, but taking a bit more conservative view of the timing and pacing of that coming back,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt likely will, but it\u2019s less clear to me how impactful and how early that would be.\u201d\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\nGenerated by readers, the comments included herein do not reflect the views and opinions of Rigzone.

                "body": "Oil Servicers Look to Middle East for Growth\nThe world\u2019s largest oilfield-service providers are looking to production increases in the Middle East to help offset a slowdown in US shale.\nThat\u2019s one of the big takeaways from comments this week made by executives at Helmerich & Payne Inc. and Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., who pointed to opportunities in countries such as Saudi Arabia to help drive growth. The comments echoed outlooks from some of the biggest names in the industry, including SLB and Weatherford International Plc, who expect the Middle East to lead a rebound in activity for the end of 2026 through 2027.\nOperators in the US shale patch, once the world\u2019s leader in oil production growth, are now closely watching commodity markets as they hover near the level that makes drilling profitable for producers. If crude prices drop into the low $50-per-barrel range for several months, companies are expected to make more drastic cuts to drilling and fracking in the US.\nGlobal oil prices have steadily declined in the past several months on expectations of a glut. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has fallen more than 10% over the past year, trading around $63 a barrel on Thursday.\nBut some producers in the Middle East can better sustain the lower crude prices, which underscores why the oilfield-services companies are looking there for growth. Projects to frack for natural gas have also emerged in the region, as governments face rising electricity demand, industrial expansion and petrochemical build-outs.\nHere\u2019s a look at recent comments from oilfield-services companies:\nHelmerich & Payne\n- One of the top drilling-rig contractors on the US shale patch, the company said the reactivation of its suspended rigs in Saudi Arabia is underway.\n- On an earnings call Thursday, incoming Chief Executive Officer Trey Adams said the company remains hopeful for further opportunities in the region\nPatterson-UTI Energy\n- The company opened a drill bit manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia that started operations in December, CEO Andy Hendricks said in a call discussing fourth-quarter results Thursday.\nSLB\n- A rebound in oil production driven by OPEC+ policy and gas becoming a priority to meet regional demand will lead to a \u201cfavorable\u201d next few years, SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch said during an earnings call on Jan. 23.\n- \u201cThe Middle East market will be characterized by rebounds in drilling and workover activity in Saudi Arabia, with rig counts potentially returning to early 2025 levels by the end of 2026, and this has already begun,\u201d Le Peuch said.\nWeatherford\n- Weatherford International, which gets a lot of its business from the Middle East/North Africa region, sees a \u201cstrong opportunity\u201d in Saudi Arabia and momentum in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman, CEO Girish Saligram said during an earnings call Wednesday.\nHalliburton\n- Halliburton Co., the world\u2019s biggest provider of fracking services, took a more cautious view, with the company estimating activity in the region being flat or down slightly in 2026, CEO Jeff Miller said during an earnings call on Jan. 21.\n- \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the activity growth in Saudi Arabia, but taking a bit more conservative view of the timing and pacing of that coming back,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt likely will, but it\u2019s less clear to me how impactful and how early that would be.\u201d\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\nGenerated by readers, the comments included herein do not reflect the views and opinions of Rigzone.

                "body": "EUR/USD climbs to 1.1830-1.1835 hurdle amid USD weakness; focus shifts to delayed NFP\n- EUR/USD scales higher for the second straight day amid some follow-through USD selling.\n- The Fed-ECB policy divergence backs the case for additional gains amid the upbeat mood.\n- The focus now shifts to the delayed release of the crucial US NFP report on Wednesday.\nThe EUR/USD pair is seen building on Friday's goodish rebound from the 1.1765 region or a two-week low and gaining positive traction for the second straight day at the start of a new week. The move higher lifts spot prices to the 1.1830-1.1835 resistance zone, marking the top end of a one-week-old range, and is sponsored by some follow-through US Dollar (USD) selling.\nConcerns about a possible conflict in the Middle East eased after the US and Iran finished a round of talks on Friday. This, in turn, drags the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the safe-haven Greenback against a basket of currencies, away from a two-week top touched last Thursday and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair. Furthermore, the diverging interest rate paths between the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) back the case for additional near-term gains for the currency pair.\nAccording to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, traders are currently pricing in the possibility that the US Fed will deliver at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2026. The bets were reaffirmed by the incoming US data, which pointed to weakness in the labor market. In contrast, the ECB has been on hold since ending a year-long run of rate cuts in June, and surprisingly resilient growth has taken all pressure off policymakers to provide any further support. This is seen as another factor lending support to the EUR/USD pair and validates the positive outlook.\nTraders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and opt to wait for the delayed release of the crucial US monthly employment details \u2013 popularly known as the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday. The closely-watched figures will play a key role in influencing the USD in the near term and provide some meaningful impetus to the EUR/USD pair. In the meantime, the broader fundamental backdrop seems tilted in favor of bulls and backs the case for further gains amid the absence of relevant macro data from the Eurozone or the US.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

                "body": "Threats of volatility still are shadowing the broad Forex market. The EUR/USD exhibited its high for last week on Monday when the 1.18750 area was challenged, but headwinds quickly erupted and incremental selling started to stiffen.\nTraders should not be surprised by the rather strong gusts changing direction the EUR/USD at this moment. Nervousness and uncertainty remain distinct tastes in the mouths of financial institutions and large traders. Trading spreads are wide, and price differentials have increased the past few weeks.\nThe EUR/USD has correlated to the broad Forex market with jolts of volatility, but a seemingly strong ability to remain within the upper tier of its range. USD centric weakness is plain to see, but there are also clearly disruptions which sometimes create shifts that suddenly linger. Day traders looking to take advantage of momentum trajectories are likely facing difficult circumstances. Risk management needs to be kept strict moving forward.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nEconomy, Data and A Lot of Noise\nThis coming week the U.S. will supposedly release its official jobs data via the Non-Farm Employment Change on Wednesday. No, this is not the normal publication cycle for the U.S. jobs statistics. A semi-government shutdown inflicted last week caused a delay in publication. Adding to the U.S. data parade this week will be Retail Sales on Tuesday and CPI inflation numbers on Friday. You have been warned.\nAdding to the data are the mixed notions about economic outlook in the U.S. and a general state of uncertainty because of a lot of noise regarding versions of reality. If that sentence seems confusing, imagine how financial institutions feel trying to guess what is going to happen in the mid-term. And it is this sense of unease which is causing volatility in the EUR/USD and other currencies. It appears that many financial houses still believe the Fed will lean into a more dovish interest rates policy, but gauging the USD remains rather challenging except to say it appears the White House is comfortable with a weaker sentiment.\nEUR/USD Higher Nervous Realms\nThe EUR/USD continues to traverse in a higher range. The last time the EUR/USD was within these higher sustained values was 2021. The ability of the EUR/USD to remain above 1.18000 is a sign financial institutions are comfortable with a weaker USD outlook.\n- However, volatility and the threat of more volatile days ahead in the near-term is a real consideration for day traders.\n- Looking for a slight move higher in the EUR/USD this coming week feels like a solid wager if technical support holds.\n- The EUR/USD well above 1.18000 is not far-fetched and real, but if the currency pair falls below, this should not surprise speculators either \u2013 this as the EUR/USD fights within its current realm trying to establish an accepted equilibrium.\nEUR/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for EUR/USD is 1.17825 to 1.19020\nThe EUR/USD is trading currently within the upper ratios of its long-term charts, but it is below temporary apex mid-term highs that were outliers. This leaves the door open to more exploration of higher values that may not feel like overbought territory to financial institutions. The U.S data that will be published this coming week will impact the EUR/USD. However, it is the policy of the U.S. White House led by Treasury Secretary Bessent which may be most important and listened to, because it appears the Trump administration wants a weaker USD.\nAnd this is what day traders should remember when they hear about jobs numbers Wednesday, and the significant inflation results this coming Friday, because a weaker USD may help the U.S. economy. However, day traders also need to remember this a game being played on a day-to-day basis in which the short-term even though it feels volatile to smaller speculators is not crucial for bigger institutions which have mid-term outlooks. In other words, the threat of EUR/USD fluctuations is much more significant for da"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic tug-of-war mode: one moment it looks like a confident grind higher, the next it feels like a nervous distribution zone. Big caps are bouncing between strong rallies and sharp pullbacks, with German bulls trying to defend crucial support while macro data keeps flashing warning lights. No clean melt-up, no total breakdown \u2013 just tense, emotional price action where every candle feels like a referendum on Europe\u2019s future.\nWant to see what people are saying?

While Wall Street steals the headlines, the German index tells you whether international money is still willing to bet on the old-school industrial engine of Europe or whether capital is quietly rotating away toward the US and Asia.\nThere are four big forces driving this market:\n- ECB policy and the euro: Christine Lagarde and the European Central Bank are stuck in a tight corner. Inflation has cooled compared to the peak, but it is still not comfortably defeated, while growth data from Germany looks fragile. Every ECB press conference turns into a live trading event: if Lagarde sounds cautious and hints at staying restrictive longer, that is typically a headwind for cyclical stocks but can support the euro. If she opens the door to future rate cuts because of weak growth, you get that classic risk-on snapback in equities, but the euro often wobbles against the dollar.\n- German macro data: Manufacturing PMI readings have been hovering in contraction territory, signalling that the heart of Germany\u2019s export machine is under pressure. Weak order books, especially from abroad, keep feeding the recession narrative. Each new PMI release can flip market mood from relief to panic within a trading session.\n- Sector rotation inside the DAX: Autos and traditional cyclicals are struggling with structural headwinds, while software, industrial automation, and some healthcare names are acting like defensive growth plays. The index is no longer just about factories and combustion engines; it is slowly morphing into a more tech-and-services-flavoured basket.\n- Global risk appetite: When US tech rips and the dollar cools down, European equities get a sympathy bid. When US yields spike and recession talk heats up again, the DAX tends to feel it first because of Germany\u2019s exposure to exports and global demand.\nWhy the ECB and EUR/USD are the secret DAX drivers\nThink of the DAX 40 as a leveraged play on the Eurozone cycle. ECB rate decisions do not just affect borrowing costs in Germany; they move the entire risk premium investors demand for holding European assets.\nIf the ECB keeps rates high for longer to fight sticky inflation, financing costs for German corporates stay elevated. That hits leveraged players, real estate, and anything capex-heavy. At the same time, a more hawkish ECB can support the euro, and a stronger euro tends to be a double-edged sword for the DAX: it makes imports cheaper, but it also makes German exports less competitive in dollar terms. For an export beast like Germany, that matters.\nOn the flip side, if incoming data forces the ECB to pivot toward cuts sooner, the narrative flips fast: suddenly, traders talk about a soft-landing scenario, relief rallies in cyclicals, and a fresh appetite for European risk assets. The euro can weaken in that scenario, which actually helps"

The recent intraday band has sat roughly between 1.3508 and 1.3625, with the 1.3550\u20131.3570 pocket acting as the first meaningful floor. Every push toward 1.37\u20131.3720 has met supply, locking the pair inside a heavy 1.35\u20131.38 corridor rather than a sustained breakout trend. A daily close below 1.3550 shifts attention to 1.3500 first and then to the 1.3460 area, where the 50-day moving average is clustered. On the upside, resistance is concentrated at 1.37\u20131.3720, with 1.3870 marking the line that would signal a genuine re-rating of sterling if it breaks and holds. Right now, price action says the market is not prepared to pay those highs while the BoE is clearly on the verge of easing.\nGBP/USD \u2013 BoE at 3.75%, a 5\u20134 split that drags the pair away from 1.3870\nThe Bank of England left Bank Rate at 3.75%, but the internal split is what moves GBP/USD. Five MPC members backed keeping rates at 3.75%, while four already voted to cut to 3.50%. That 5\u20134 margin effectively tells you that one or two meetings separate the current stance from the first move lower. Before the decision, markets were pricing roughly 35 bp of BoE easing for 2026; after the vote details hit the tape, that shifted toward about 50 bp. That repricing cheapened sterling across the board and pulled GBP/USD down through 1.36 toward the 1.3550 band in a straight line. A 3.75% policy rate is still restrictive against current UK data, so as long as curves imply more and earlier cuts from the BoE than from the Fed, the pair carries a structural downward tilt on rallies.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Inflation above 2%, unemployment near 5.1% and why 3.75% looks too tight\nUK headline inflation remains above the 2% target but the December release confirmed a downtrend, not a renewed spike. That pattern gives the BoE room to shift focus toward real activity and jobs. Unemployment sits near a four-year high around 5.1%. Payrolls dropped by roughly 43,000 in December and wage growth is rolling over from previous peaks. Under those conditions, a 3.75% Bank Rate is clearly on the restrictive side of the dial. The market is therefore comfortable pricing at least two 25-bp cuts over the next 12 months. That configuration weighs on GBP/USD whenever the day\u2019s story is UK-centric, especially after a failed break above 1.3870 and repeated failures to hold above 1.37.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Fed path, Kevin Warsh and a dollar that supports the downside but doesn\u2019t crush sterling\nOn the USD leg, the picture is firm but not explosive. President Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair nudged expectations away from an aggressively dovish stance and handed the dollar a short-term boost. At the same time, US data is cooling rather than collapsing. ADP private payrolls fell to around 22,000 in January, far below the 150,000-plus prints seen in hotter quarters. Job openings are trending lower, and initial jobless claims have moved into the mid-200,000s. The futures curve still builds in roughly two Fed cuts in 2026. That means the dollar can rally on risk-off episodes or hawkish soundbites, but it is not set up for a sustained runaway bull market on current numbers. For GBP/USD, the result is straightforward: USD can lean on the pair and help hold it below 1.37\u20131.3870, but it needs a stronger macro surprise to drive a clean collapse through 1.3330 and down toward 1.30.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Technical layers: 1.3870 as the ceiling, 1.3550\u20131.3500 as the defence line "

                "body": "AUD/USD update\nAUD/USD has achieved its first weekly close above the 0.7000 mark since January 2023, buoyed by a Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike and demonstrating resilience amid global market volatility.\nHow RBA's rate hike propelled AUD/USD past 0.7000\nAUD/USD finished higher last week at 0.7013, posting a solid 0.72% gain. This marked its third consecutive week of gains and, more significantly, its first weekly close above the psychological 0.7000 level since January 2023.\nThese gains occurred against the backdrop of an extremely volatile week. Risk assets, including equities, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals plunged sharply before mounting a strong rebound into the weekend. Despite the turbulence, the Australian dollar (AUD) demonstrated notable resilience, holding firm and pushing higher as the dust settled.\nWhile overall volatility in the foreign exchange (FX) space didn\u2019t reach the extremes seen in other asset classes last week, AUD/USD was further cushioned by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The RBA delivered its first rate hike in over two years, adopting a hawkish tone that widened the interest rate differential in favour of the AUD versus the United States dollar (USD) .\nFuture outlook for AUD/USD\nLooking ahead, the path for AUD/USD will be shaped by incoming data ahead of the next RBA board meeting. Key domestic releases this week include:\n- Westpac consumer confidence\n- National Australia Bank (NAB) business confidence\nSpeeches from the RBA's Hauser and Hunter\nFurthermore, direction will depend on whether the elevated market volatility of 2026 subsides somewhat and the outcome of this week's US non-farm payrolls report.\nWestpac consumer confidence\nDate: Tuesday, 10 February at 10.30am AEDT\nFor January, Australian consumer confidence dipped 1.7% to 92.9, sliding to a three-month low from December's 94.5. This extended the sharp 9% drop seen the previous month, pushing sentiment deeper into pessimistic territory as households grappled with renewed RBA rate hike fears.\nA key driver was surging mortgage rate expectations, fuelled by hawkish RBA signals and persistent inflation concerns. Partial offsets included modest gains in assessments of family finances compared to a year ago (2.3%) and longer-term economic views (0.9%), while house price expectations remained bullish but cooled slightly.\nLooking ahead to February's reading, the RBA\u2019s 25 basis point (bp) rate hike last week, combined with a darkening inflation outlook and expectations of further tightening, suggests sentiment is likely to soften further toward the 90 mark.\nThe Australian interest rate market starts this week with 4 bp (16% probability) of a 25 bp rate hike built in for the RBA\u2019s March meeting, with a full 25 bp hike priced for the RBA\u2019s June meeting.\nAustralian consumer confidence chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nIn last week\u2019s update, we outlined our view that the pullback from the 0.7094 high was likely a healthy correction and noted a strong band of support in the 0.6900 - 0.6800 zone.\nAfter holding and bouncing from this support area, we expect to see a retest of the 0.7094 high, with the potential to extend into the 0.7150 - 0.7200 zone if the RBA delivers multiple rate hikes this year.\nHowever, we remain aware that a clean break below 0.6800 would raise questions about the bull trend's strength and open the door to a deeper pullback towards 0.6700.\nAUD/USD daily candlestick chart\n- Source: TradingView.

The pair appreciates as the commodity-linked Australian Dollar (AUD), often seen as a liquid barometer of global risk sentiment, gains ground amid easing concerns over AI-driven disruption and revived investor confidence.\nThe AUD also receives support after hawkish comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock, saying that the board lifted the Official Cash Rate (OCR) because the economy is more capacity-constrained than previously judged, meaning policy needed to be tighter. Bullock added that the RBA needs to dampen demand growth unless supply capacity can expand faster.\nAustralia\u2019s Household spending fell 0.4% month-over-month (MoM) in December 2025, reversing a 1.0% increase in the previous month and missing market expectations for a 0.2% rise.

Spending grew 5.0% year-over-year (YoY), the slowest pace in four months, easing from a 6.0% gain in November.\nThe risk-sensitive AUD/USD pair gained ground after Bloomberg reported that Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian called Friday\u2019s nuclear talks with the US \u201ca step forward,\u201d while rejecting intimidation.

The US economy is expected to add 70,000 jobs, while the Unemployment Rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with Chin"

Katayama reiterated that she was keeping in close contact with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to maintain stability in the USD/JPY movement.\nKey quotes\nUsing FX reserves to fund tax cuts or spending requires a professional approach and is not easy.\nIt may be possible to tap FX reserves to fund state spending, though this could create issues if reserves are also needed for intervention.\nGovernment will seek dialogue with markets on Monday as needed.\nGovernment is in good dialogue with the BOJ, BlackRock, and IMF executives who understand Japan\u2019s position.\nMarket reaction\nAs of writing, the USD/JPY pair is up 0.31% on the day at 157.60.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Simply put, unless there\u2019s a dramatic shift, the dollar will likely stay firm\u2014driven by Fed hawkishness and lingering uncertainty\u2014while the yen remains under steady pressure from BOJ easing and mixed growth signals.\nPolicy divergence is a key driver behind the dollar\u2019s strength against the yen. The Federal Reserve has been gradually dialing back its rate hikes, but interest rates in the U.S. remain elevated compared to those in Japan.\nJapan\u2019s central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), remains on a path of ultra-loose policy. Negative or near-zero interest rates and continued yield curve control have limited the yen\u2019s appeal to global investors. At the same time, easy monetary policy in Japan and tight policy in the U.S. tends to attract capital out of yen and into dollar assets.\nBeyond this, inflation trends reinforce the divide. U.S. inflation has cooled somewhat\u2014but remains sticky\u2014keeping the Fed cautious and markets expecting rates to remain higher for longer. Meanwhile, Japan continues to grapple with very low, even below-target, inflation. This means BOJ has little incentive to hike or shift to neutral policy.\nAll these reinforce pressure on the yen. In practice, unless Japan surprises with a shift in tone\u2014or the U.S. signals rate cuts soon\u2014the dollar likely stays firm.\nThe yen has traditionally been a safe-haven asset. In times of global risk-off, yen usually strengthens as investors flee to perceived safety. But that pattern has shifted recently.\nOn the other hand, when markets are risk-on, yen tends to fall further since it\u2019s seen as a high-cost funding currency for carry trades. And with U.S. growth holding up, markets often favor dollar exposure.\n\u201cCurrency pressure isn\u2019t just about rates\u2014it\u2019s about where investors want to put their money, and right now the U.S. is the place.\u201d\nWhen risk sentiment is jittery, we still see only modest yen strength. In calmer or risk-positive phases, the yen weakens instead.\nGrowth trajectories and inflation between the two economies are further tilting the scales.\nU.S. continues to show decent growth and job market resilience. Even with inflation easing, the labor and services sectors remain solid, providing cover for the Fed to keep rates elevated.\nJapan\u2019s growth remains fragile in parts. Domestic demand is sluggish, and export strength depends heavily on global cycles. Inflation lies stubbornly below target\u2014despite recent upticks in energy price pass-through\u2014signaling sustained need for accommodative policy.\nThis contrast feeds into investor expectations. If Japan were to see a meaningful rebound, investors might reconsider. But absent that, they continue favoring dollar assets.\nOf course, currencies don\u2019t move without friction. Japan has occasionally stepped in to prop up the yen when moves were extreme. But interventions are typically reactive and limited.\nWhen the yen weakens sharply, authorities issue warnings, then move to buy yen in FX markets. These moves can arrest downward slides\u2014temporarily. But if fundamentals continue to push dollar higher, these measures only delay the inevitable.\nAnother factor: market structure. Yen liquidity, especially at key levels, can fluctuate broadly. Automated systems and positioning can deepen moves in either direction. So, while intervention matters, it has to be heavy-handed and sustained to have lasting impact.\nInvestors often borrow in low-yielding currencies like yen and invest in higher-return assets\u2014called carry trades. In the past decade, these strategies amplified yen sell-offs. Here\u2019s why they matter now:\nEven a shift in mood\u2014say, a minor positive surprise in U.S. data\u2014can spur carry positions and furt"

Traders weigh mixed Canadian January employment data. Key US labor market data will be the highlight later on Wednesday.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Vice Chair Philip Jefferson stated on Friday that current interest rates are \"roughly in the range of neutral,\" with the job market stabilizing and policy well-positioned to handle risks, emphasizing that future actions will be data-dependent. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that she thinks one or two more interest rate cuts may be needed to address the weakening labor market.\nTraders will take more cues from the speeches from Fed officials later on Monday, including Christopher Waller, Stephen Miran and Raphael Bostic. Any dovish comments from policymakers could weigh on the Greenback against the CAD in the near term.\nThe attention will shift to the US January employment report on Wednesday for some hints about the Fed's monetary policy path. The report was delayed from last week due to a four-day partial government shutdown that ended earlier in February. Markets forecast the US economy will add 70,000 jobs in January, while the Unemployment Rate is projected to remain unchanged at 4.4% during the same period.\nOn the Loonie front, Statistics Canada reported on Friday that Canada unexpectedly lost 24,800 jobs in January, but the losses were all part-time. However, the Unemployment Rate in Canada fell to 6.5%, the lowest since September 2024, better than the expectations of 6.8%. This report has reduced the downside risk to Canada\u2019s growth and policy outlook, narrowing expectations for aggressive Bank of Canada (BoC) easing. This, in turn, could underpin the CAD and act as a headwind for the pair.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates w"

The weekend pause leaves traders eyeing Monday for updates from RBC\u2014attention turning from the screen to what the bank will say on loans, losses, and interest rates. 1\nIt\u2019s rates \u2014 again. Canada lost 24,800 jobs in January, a surprise drop, but the unemployment rate ticked down to 6.5%. The loonie picked up strength as stocks bounced and markets weighed signs the Bank of Canada isn\u2019t eager to move on cuts. Ten-year Canadian yields inched up to roughly 3.414%. 2\nOn Thursday, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized the uncertainty clouding the outlook and warned against jumping to conclusions about economic softness. \u201cThis will be measured in years, not quarters,\u201d Macklem said, referring to what he described as an ongoing transition\u2014language that leaves open questions about whether the central bank\u2019s next move is a rate cut, staying put, or something else entirely. 3\nRBC\u2019s U.S.-listed shares wrapped up Friday\u2019s session in New York at $170.40, posting a 0.9% gain. The stock mostly mirrored the broader risk-on mood; no fresh headlines drove the move.\nBank investors are watching to see if steady or rising yields can boost margins, but not so much that borrowers start struggling.

That scenario often hits bank multiples fast\u2014dividends may hold up, but it doesn\u2019t matter much if multiples take a hit.\nRBC will release its first-quarter numbers on Feb. 26. 4\nAfter earnings, eyes shift to March 18, when Canada\u2019s next policy decision drops \u2014 a key date for Canadian financials coming off a barrage of data that\u2019s clouded forecasts. 5"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast: Holds medium-term bullish bias above 1.3600\n- GBP/USD weakens near 1.3605 in Monday\u2019s early European session.\n- The major pair keeps the bullish bias in the medium term above the 100-day EMA.\n- The initial support level emerges at 1.3580; the immediate resistance level to watch is 1.3870.\nThe GBP/USD pair trades on a softer note around 1.3605 during the early European session on Monday. Growing expectation of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) interest-rate cut weighs on the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the Greenback.\nThe BoE was widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.75%, but the number of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members supporting keeping rates unchanged was lower than the seven expected by markets.\n\u201cWe continue to expect the next rate cut in March. After that, we think the BOE will deliver a prolonged pause before resuming policy normalization in early 2027 (we see a terminal rate of 3.00% by mid-2027),\u201d said Dani Stoilova, UK and Europe economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360.\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD holds above the100-day EMA, preserving a bullish bias. Dips would find demand while above this average. Bollinger Bands show price tracking above the middle band as the envelopes widen, pointing to rising momentum. RSI at 52 (neutral) stabilizes above the 50 line, keeping a modest upside tilt.\nMaintaining traction over the 20-day middle band at 1.3580 would keep the topside in focus, with the upper Bollinger Band capping at 1.3870. A pullback below that pivot would expose 1.3290 at the lower band as the next sizeable support.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa fo"

                "body": "S&P 500\nThe S&P 500 continues to be very noisy, and this past week has seen it test the 7,000 level and even break below the 6,800 level before turning around. Ultimately, this is a market that still looks very much like an index that\u2019s trying to sort out where to go next and that makes perfect sense considering that we are in the midst of earnings season.\nUltimately, this remains a bit of a buy on the dip bounce. I think it brings more FOMO into the picture. If the S&P 500 can break above the 7,000 level, then the S&P 500 will probably continue to go much higher. I do think that\u2019s the case, but in the meantime, things might be a little bit noisy.\nEUR/USD\nThe Euro has been very noisy during the week as we are testing the 1.18 level, an area that previously had been resistant. The previous week was a horrific looking shooting star, so we are still in a phase of questioning as to whether or not the Euro really can take off to the upside.\nIf we break down below the bottom of the candlestick for this past week, I think we could go looking to the 1.16 level, just re-entering the consolidation phase. Ultimately, I expect to see a lot of noisy behavior, but over the longer term, there are still a lot of questions as to what the ECB\u2019s going to do and of course whether or not the Federal Reserve is going to cut rates quick enough and perhaps satiate the market. All things being equal, I\u2019m pretty neutral on this pair.\nUSD/CAD\nThe US dollar rallied against the Canadian dollar but struggles at the 1.37 level again. It\u2019s sitting right at the 200-week EMA and had formed a hammer during the previous week, so we\u2019ll have to see whether or not the buyers can push this thing higher.\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, it does look like a very interesting area to get long and the interest rate differential does favor the US, although I think this is more the purview of short-term traders and I would not be looking for massive moves anytime soon because quite frankly that\u2019s not what this pair does most of the time anyway.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nUSD/CHF\nThe US dollar has rallied a bit against the Swiss franc to break above the 0.78 handle, a large round psychologically significant figure that a lot of people will be watching. I\u2019m particularly interested in this pair because of the hammer that formed last week and the fact that the Swiss National Bank continues to complain that they do not like the strengthening Swiss franc.\nIf that continues to be the case, they will eventually get involved and intervene, sending this pair and anything else denominated in Swiss francs higher as they devalue their own currency. It\u2019s a positive swap to go long, but it\u2019s also going to be a difficult path higher, so keep that in mind.\nUSD/MXN\nThe US dollar has been all over the place against the Mexican peso as the 17.50 level continues to offer resistance. That being said, the 17 pesos level below is probably going to be your short-term target.\nThere is a lot of support underneath from a long-term standpoint, so we\u2019ll have to see whether or not we can break down below there. As things stand right now though, it is still a nice carry trade, at least for shorter-term traders. This week probably ends up being just as choppy as the previous two, so I\u2019m not expecting massive moves here.\nDAX\nThe German DAX has been bullish most of the week, but it still struggles with the 25,000 level. If we can break above that 25,000 level on at least a daily candlestick if not a weekly one, then I think that opens up the German index to go much higher.\nA Global Search for Support\nQuite frankly, I think that happens eventually. This is not the type of market that I believe you can short; it is going to get a lot of support from the German government given enough time as they are just throwing money into the economy. So, I like the idea of buying dips in the DAX.\nUSD/JPY\nThe US dollar has performed quite well against the Japanese yen this week despite the fact that recently we had some ty"

This comparison highlights the practical differences that may matter most for those weighing these two leading spot bitcoin ETFs.\nSnapshot (cost & size)\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.\nBoth funds are priced at 0.25% annually, making them more affordable than most actively managed vehicles targeting alternative assets. With no dividend or yield offered by either ETF, cost efficiency is the primary differentiator on fees.\nPerformance & risk comparison\nWhat's inside\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is a straightforward vehicle for bitcoin exposure, holding 99.98% of assets in Bitcoin (XBTUSD) and the remainder in net other assets. Sector allocation is not reported, but with just two holdings and over two years on the market, the fund is focused exclusively on tracking bitcoin\u2019s price. There are no notable quirks or leverage resets, and the fund does not track a named index.\niShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is even more concentrated, with 100% of its portfolio in bitcoin and cash, and no sector diversification. Its assets under management (AUM) are much larger, at roughly $64.8 billion, and the fund\u2019s top holdings mirror FBTC\u2019s, with bitcoin dominating the exposure. Like FBTC, IBIT is structured for simplicity, with no additional overlays or quirks.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.\nWhat this means for investors\nThese are the two largest spot bitcoin ETFs available to investors, but IBIT is far and away the largest at around $65 billion in assets under management. FBTC is a distant second with about $17.7 billion.\nThere really is no difference in holdings, as both are 100% invested in bitcoin and have basically identical returns. Both are down about 16.3% year-to-date and 26% over the past 12 months, as of Feb. 4.\nThe similarities don\u2019t end there, as the two ETFs carry the same expense ratio of 0.25%. IBIT had a lower ratio to start, but it is now 0.25% for new investors.\nAdvertisement\nSo, what, if anything, would give the edge to one of these ETFs over the other? Obviously, if you are a Fidelity brokerage customer, it would be more convenient to buy on the Fidelity platform and have custody handled in-house. It would also be kept with your other investments.\nThe advantage IBIT has is that it provides greater liquidity from significantly more trading volume. This typically results in lower trading costs and faster trade execution.\nSo, in reality, there is not a huge difference between the two aside from convenience for Fidelity brokerage customers and the liquidity edge for the iShares ETF.\nShould you buy stock in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fid"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF flow numbers are fundamentally broken and most traders are missing the specific sign of a crash\nThe real signal here is dispersion: how many funds are green, how concentrated the red is, and whether the pattern repeats.\nOn Jan.30, 2026, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $509.7 million in net outflows, which looks like pretty straightforward negative sentiment until you look at the individual tickers and realize a few of them stayed green.\nThat contradiction aged fast over the next few days. Feb. 2 snapped back with $561.8 million in net inflows, then Feb. 3 flipped to -$272.0 million, and Feb. 4 sank to -$544.9 million. The totals went up and down, but the more useful clue was the same one hiding in plain sight on Jan. 30: the category can look like one trade from a distance, while the money inside it moves in very different rhythms.\nBy the time Bitcoin slid below $71,000, ETF flows and price finally started to rhyme.\nIf you're trying to read the ETF flow table like a mood ring, the table will definitely mislead you. The total number you see in the table is a scoreboard, not the play-by-play, and it can easily be dragged around by one large exit even while smaller pockets of demand keep persisting. The green islands in the deep red sea are real, but it's rarely the heroic resistance signal people want it to be.\nWhy \u201ctotal flows\u201d lie on the days you care most about\nSecondary-market trading is people swapping ETF shares with each other, while primary-market creations and redemptions are what change the share count. Flow tables almost always aim at the second layer, the net creation or destruction of shares. The SEC\u2019s investor bulletin makes the key distinction very clear: ETF shares trade on an exchange, but supply changes through the creation and redemption process.\nThat split matters because a day can see crazy volumes and price action and still print zero flows for a given fund if buyers and sellers just match each other in the secondary market. And a day can print a huge outflow because one or a few large holders decide to redeem, even if there's steady buying elsewhere.\nThis is why dispersion is worth tracking. Instead of staring at the net number, count how many funds are green versus red, then ask how concentrated the red is. On Jan. 30, the numbers were brutal everywhere: IBIT -$528.3 million versus a -$509.7 million total, which means the rest of the complex was slightly positive when you add it up. FBTC's $7.3 million, ARKB's $8.3 million, and BRRR's $3 million inflows were small, but they were still inflows.\nAt the beginning of February, we saw a much cleaner example of what broad-based demand looks like and what a concentrated exit looks like.\nOn Feb. 2, net inflows were spread across the leaders, including IBIT's $142.0 million and FBTC's $153.3 million, BITB's $96.5 million, and ARKB's $65.1 million inflows joining in. That's what a category-wide \u201cbuy day\u201d looks like in the flow data: more than one desk, more than one platform, and more than one fund.\nOn Feb. 3, the table turned into a lesson in internal conflict. IBIT was still up $60.0 million, while FBTC printed -$148.7 million and ARKB -$62.5 million, pulling the total to -$272.0 million. The category was net red while the biggest vehicle stayed green, which is the mirror image of Jan. 30\u2019s story. The takeaway here is not that one ticker smart money and the others aren't, but that the ETF market now has different buyer types with different rules, and they don't all hit the button at the same time.\nOn Feb. 4, the outflows deepened to -$544.9 million, with IBIT -$373.4 million and FBTC -$86.4 million leading the day, plus smaller outflows across other funds. That was the day Bitcoin dipped under $72,000 in a broad risk-off backdrop.\nWhen analyzing the ETF market, it's important not to treat every green print as fresh conviction. A micro-inflow can be real demand, but it can also be allocation drift getting corrected, a model portfolio topping up a sleeve, or a"

                "body": "As global financial markets increasingly integrate digital assets, analysts and institutions worldwide are scrutinizing Bitcoin\u2019s potential trajectory through the latter half of this decade. This analysis examines the critical factors that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s price from 2026 through 2030, drawing from historical patterns, macroeconomic trends, and technological developments. Understanding this multi-year outlook requires a neutral examination of both supportive catalysts and potential headwinds.\nBitcoin Price Prediction: Foundational Market Context\nBitcoin\u2019s market behavior often correlates with its four-year halving cycles, which reduce the rate of new supply issuance. The next halving is projected for 2024, historically setting the stage for subsequent market phases. Consequently, the period from 2026 to 2030 will likely reflect the maturation of the post-2024 halving cycle. Market analysts frequently reference previous cycles to model potential outcomes, though past performance never guarantees future results. Furthermore, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic conditions for interest rates will serve as primary price drivers during this timeframe.\nSeveral key metrics provide context for long-term valuation models. The network\u2019s hash rate, a measure of computational security, has shown consistent long-term growth. Additionally, the growth of the Lightning Network for scaling and the accumulation of BTC by publicly-listed companies and nation-states contribute to a changing demand profile. These fundamental elements form the basis for most expert projections, which range from conservative to highly optimistic.\nExpert Methodologies and Forecasting Models\nFinancial institutions and veteran analysts employ diverse methodologies. Some utilize stock-to-flow models that compare Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply to its annual issuance. Others focus on network-value-to-transaction ratios or draw parallels with the adoption curves of other transformative technologies like the internet. Importantly, all models carry significant assumptions about adoption rates, regulatory environments, and the absence of black swan events. Therefore, a spectrum of predictions exists, reflecting different underlying scenarios.\nAnalyzing the 2026-2030 BTC Forecast Timeline\nThe following table presents a synthesized overview of potential price ranges for Bitcoin, based on aggregated analyst reports and model projections. These figures represent scenarios, not certainties, and hinge on continued network development and broader market acceptance.\nIt is crucial to interpret these ranges as part of a dynamic system. For instance, a report from Fidelity Digital Assets in late 2023 highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s evolving correlation with macro indicators. Similarly, analysis from Glassnode often emphasizes on-chain data like realized capitalization and long-term holder behavior. These data points provide a more nuanced view than price alone.\nCritical Factors Shaping the Long-Term Outlook\nSeveral non-price variables will fundamentally determine which predictive scenario unfolds. First, regulatory developments in major economies like the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom will impact institutional participation. Clear, supportive regulation could accelerate adoption, while restrictive policies could create regional headwinds. Second, technological advancement in layer-2 solutions and privacy enhancements will affect Bitcoin\u2019s utility and security proposition.\nThird, the broader macroeconomic environment remains pivotal. Persistent inflation, currency debasement, or geopolitical instability could enhance Bitcoin\u2019s perceived value as a hedge. Conversely, a period of strong global economic stability and high real interest rates might reduce its relative appeal. Finally, competition from other digital assets and potential breakthroughs in quantum computing, though considered long-term risks, are factors monitored by seriou"

                "body": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and crypto analyst c-node have reignited the debate over the true purpose of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\nTogether, the two industry experts challenge the booming industry to rethink its priorities.\nSponsoredExperts Clash Over What Counts as \u201cReal\u201d DeFi\nThe underlying issue, according to the experts, is that much of today\u2019s DeFi hype is superficial, serving speculative interests rather than advancing genuinely DeFi infrastructure.\n\u201cThere is no reason to use DeFi unless you have longs on cryptocurrencies and want access to financial services while preserving self-custody,\u201d c-node wrote.\nThey dismissed common yield-generating strategies\u2014like depositing USDC into lending protocols\u2014as \u201ccargo cults,\u201d suggesting they mimic DeFi\u2019s success without embodying its original ethos.\nThe analyst further emphasized that non-Ethereum chains may struggle to replicate Ethereum\u2019s DeFi boom, noting that early ETH participants were ideologically committed to self-custody. Meanwhile, newer ecosystems are dominated by venture capital funds using institutional custodians.\nButerin\u2019s reply offered both a counterpoint and a broader framework for what counts as \u201creal\u201d DeFi. The Russo-Canadian innovator argued that algorithmic stablecoins, particularly when overcollateralized or structured to decentralize counterparty risk, qualify as genuinely decentralized.\nSponsored\u201cEven if 99% of the liquidity is backed by CDP holders who hold negative algo-dollars and separately positive dollars elsewhere, the fact that you have the ability to punt the counterparty risk to a market maker is still a big feature,\u201d Buterin wrote.\nDeFi\u2019s Ideological Divide and the Push for Decentralized Risk\nThe Ethereum co-founder also criticized popular USDC-based strategies, noting that simply depositing centralized stablecoins into lending protocols fails to meet the criteria for DeFi.\nBeyond technical definitions, he articulated a long-term vision: moving away from dollar-denominated systems toward diversified units of account backed by decentralized collateral structures.\nThe discussion highlights a deeper ideological divide within crypto:\nSponsored- On one side, DeFi is seen as a tool for speculative capital efficiency\u2014leveraging positions and generating yields without relinquishing custody.\n- On the other hand, it is viewed as a foundational financial system capable of reshaping the global monetary sector through decentralization and risk distribution.\nSubsequent replies in the thread reinforced this tension. Some argued that using DeFi with centralized assets still reduces intermediaries, potentially lowering systemic risk.\nOthers, however, sided with c-node\u2019s purist view, predicting that market forces will favor self-custody-driven protocols over hybrid or fiat-backed systems.\nThis debate may shape the next phase of crypto innovation. Ethereum\u2019s dominance in DeFi, fueled by ideological early adopters, contrasts sharply with other chains, where venture-backed investors prioritize convenience over decentralization.\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s push for overcollateralized algorithmic stablecoins and diversified indices points to a possible evolution beyond current dollar-pegged structures.\nSponsoredAs DeFi approaches its second decade, these discussions show that the sector is no longer just about yields and liquidity.\nInstead, the conversation is turning toward the very principles that define it\u2014custody, decentralization, and risk distribution.\nThis raises questions about whether DeFi can truly offer an alternative to TradFi systems or remains a sophisticated tool for crypto speculators."

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in one of those classic crypto limbo zones: too bullish to fade, too risky to ape blindly. Price action has been swinging in wide, emotional ranges, with brutal shakeouts followed by aggressive bounces. Whales are playing games near key zones, retail is nervous, and yet the on-chain and tech fundamentals keep leveling up. This is peak cognitive dissonance season for ETH traders.\nWant to see what people are saying? Here are the real opinions:\n- Watch deep-dive Ethereum price prediction videos traders are arguing about right now\n- Scroll the latest Instagram buzz on Ethereum upgrades and on-chain vibes\n- Binge viral TikToks where traders flex insane Ethereum wins and brutal liquidations\nThe Narrative: Right now, Ethereum is less about instant moon missions and more about a slow, ruthless repricing of what the network actually is: the base layer for a modular, rollup-heavy future. The big storyline isn\u2019t just the mainnet chart; it\u2019s the ecosystem war between layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, and how they siphon traffic while still funneling value back to ETH.\nOn the news front, Ethereum headlines are dominated by a few key themes:\n- Layer-2 Scaling Wars: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and others are fighting for dominance with aggressive incentives, airdrop farming, and yield opportunities. This is pulling DeFi, NFT, and gaming liquidity into rollups while settling on Ethereum mainnet. The result: mainnet blockspace demand becomes more spiky and narrative-driven, with traffic clustering around big events, airdrops, and on-chain rotations.\n- Regulation & ETFs: ETH is living in the shadow of Bitcoin ETF flows and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Talk around Ethereum-based ETFs, staking classification, and whether ETH is viewed as a commodity vs. a security is creating a constant background tension. Institutions are watching. Some are dipping in slowly, others are waiting for clearer rules before they go heavy.\n- Upgrades & Roadmap: The next big wave is the Pectra upgrade and further steps toward the long-term roadmap: Verkle Trees, better state management, lighter nodes, and a smoother UX for validators and devs. Every upgrade nudges Ethereum closer to being a scalable, efficient, and institution-friendly settlement layer.\n- On-Chain Rotation: Capital keeps rotating through narratives: DeFi, memecoins, restaking, liquid staking, NFTs, and new yield meta on L2s. Each wave spikes gas fees for a bit, burns more ETH, and then cools off. Traders who understand these rotations can front-run gas surges and fee burn cycles.\nUnderneath the noise, the real driver is simple: Ethereum is settling an increasing amount of economic activity, but the market is constantly re-evaluating what that\u2019s worth in a world where L2s are cheap, tradfi is sniffing around, and macro risk is still not fully gone.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Let\u2019s break this down into what actually matters for traders: gas, burn, flows, and macro risk.\n1. Gas Fees: Pain, Opportunity, and L2 Relief\nEthereum gas fees have shifted from a constant nightmare to a cyclical headache. Instead of being permanently insane, they now spike during:\n- Major NFT drops or hot mints\n- DeFi yield rotations, especially when a new protocol launches on mainnet\n- Insane memecoin seasons where everyone apes at once\n- Big on-chain arbitrage and liquidations during volatility\nLayer-2s have soaked up a big chunk of everyday activity. Users who just want to trade, farm yield, or play with smaller bags are increasingly moving to:\n- Arbitrum: DeFi-heavy, big whales, complex strategies, perp trading, yield and airdrop hunters.\n- Optimism: Governance and ecosystem grants driving app development, strong synergy with major DeFi protocols.\n- Base: Coinbase-backed, massive retail funnel, memecoins and NFT activity"

Solana has declined 11% over the past week, as of 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday, posting one of the largest weekly declines among its mega-cap cryptocurrency counterparts.\nLet's dive into what's driving so much turmoil for investors in the world's seventh-largest digital asset right now.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

See the stocks \u00bb\nA week investors would like to forget\nSource: Getty Images.\nThis week's rather depressing move was driven primarily by ratcheted-up macro concerns about a potential U.S. takeover of Greenland, new rhetoric about potential tariffs across a number of European allies tied to this bid, and a building so-called \"sell U.S.\" trade surrounding U.S. fixed income and equity assets. As a correlated asset to risk equities, Solana's decline can certainly be partly explained by the key events that unfolded last weekend (which positively impacted other assets such as precious metals).\nNow, crypto is a global game, and Solana is one of the top global powerhouses in the smart contract-enabled layer-1 network space. It's also among the fastest and cheapest from a transaction standpoint, so technological advantages are driving this token's value that are worth considering. Importantly, we did see some positive catalysts materialize this week, with key traditional finance players announcing that key stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft could be traded on Solana via Ondo Finance, via the tokenization trend.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately, this catalyst was offset by news that a key Solana meme coin (Pump.fun) has been named in a class action lawsuit. This lawsuit also reportedly affects other entities within the Solana ecosystem, including the Solana Foundation (the parent company that drives the innovation and development Solana investors enjoy). That's not great news.\nSo, it's been a mixed week for news flow. However, one thing is for certain-the negative news has far outweighed any sort of positive developments Solana is putting forward.

The news triggered widespread panic, resulting in nearly $19.5 billion in leveraged liquidations as major cryptocurrencies posted double-digit declines.\nYet beneath the surface, large holders were quietly doing the opposite. Whale wallets began accumulating aggressively throughout the downturn. Recent crypto news highlights Solana, Cardano, and Pepeto ((https://pepeto.io/) as three of the most accumulated assets during the sell-off. When whales buy into fear, it often signals confidence in an upcoming directional move.\nSolana (SOL): Smart Money Steps In as Price Slips Below $200\nSolana's price has weakened significantly compared with earlier trading levels, with SOL recently trading around ~$85-$90 after bottoming into the $70s during a broad market sell-off, a far cry from the ~$200+ range referenced previously. Short-term technical action shows volatility and attempts at stabilization rather than a clear bullish breakout, and the price remains below several prior key levels after the breakdown.\nOn-chain and market data paint a mixed picture of investor behavior. While some whales and institutional vehicles (including selective Solana-linked ETFs) have continued to show accumulation or inflows, broader network participation and long-term holder accumulation rates have cooled or slowed, suggesting recent buying may be more opportunistic and tactical rather than a firm return of conviction. At the same time, traders are watching whether SOL can reclaim psychological resistance near $100+, a reclaim that could signal short-term relief and set up testing of higher levels.\nUnlike the old optimistic tier near $240-$245, the current context places important resistance closer to $100-$110 and then into the low-$120s if broader sentiment improves. A sustained move above those levels could reopen upside toward the mid-$100s and beyond, but failure to solidify support risks SOL remaining range-bound near current lows or testing deeper support zones.\nDespite price pressure, the Solana network itself continues operating smoothly, and certain on-chain fundamentals remain intactm, suggesting the recent dip is being viewed by some large holders as a corrective repricing rather than a structural breakdown\nCardano (ADA): Institutional Wallets Quietly Position for the Next Move\nSantiment data still shows signs of large ADA holders accumulating, with whale wallets in the 10-100 million ADA range adding to their positions even as prices have weakened. Recent on-chain reports note continued incremental accumulation (e.g., roughly 210 million ADA added by whales over several weeks) despite sloppy price action, reinforcing a buy-the-dip narrative among larger holders.\nPrice data shows Cardano (ADA) currently trading around $0.27-$0.28, down sharply from earlier levels and under pressure from broader risk-off conditions. While this is far below the higher ranges discussed in previous outlooks, many on-chain observers continue viewing sustained whale accumulation as a potential foundation for future support.\nReported exchange reserve movements have varied, and recent analysis indicates selling pressure has diminished versus earlier weeks, a dynamic some interpret as reduced distribution rather than fresh accumulation. Additionally, futures open interest and trader participation metrics have weakened, suggesting less aggressive positioning at current levels.\nSpeculation around an ADA spot ETF remains part of the narrative supporting sentiment, though regulatory developments have been mixed and have influenced market confidence at times. Past coverage noted rising odds and interest in such products, but the macro and regulatory backdrop continues to weigh on near-"

                "body": "The Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average, the oldest benchmark of the U.S. stock market, has surpassed the \u201850,000 high\u2019 for the first time in history. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that dominated the New York stock market for nearly the past year has slowed, analysis suggests a \u2018Great Rotation\u2019 is emerging, with buying momentum spreading to cyclical and consumer goods stocks backed by strong fundamentals.\n\u25c7\u2018Childlike Heart\u2019 Leading to 50,000\u2026 Disney\u2019s Revival\nOn the 6th, the Dow Jones index rose 2.47% (1,206.95) from the previous day to close at 50,115.67. This marked the first time in 130 years, since the index\u2019s inception in 1896, that it surpassed 50,000 points. Reuters and other foreign media reported, \u201cThe Dow Jones\u2019 all-time high despite tech stock sell-offs suggests a shift in market leadership.\u201d\nIt is evaluated that the traditional powerhouse Disney, not NVIDIA or Microsoft, led the Dow Jones index into the 50,000 era. The Dow Jones index comprises 30 high-quality blue-chip stocks representing the U.S. economy, and among them, Disney has been a relatively undervalued mid-to-lower-tier stock. However, in its fourth-quarter results for last year, announced on the 2nd, it recorded sales of $2.598 billion (approximately 36 trillion Korean won), exceeding market expectations ($2.574 billion). This was driven by the streaming service turning a profit and the recovery of theme park profitability.\nIn particular, the Dow Jones index is calculated using a price-weighted method (stocks with higher prices have a greater weight in the index), and Disney, a mid-to-lower-tier stock, has acted as a support when the overall index faces downward pressure. While high-priced stocks have driven the overall index upward recently, Disney has supported the bottom, serving as a pillar for the Dow Jones\u2019 50,000 era. Fox Business analyzed, \u201cAlong with easing inflation concerns, consumer-focused blue-chip stocks like Disney and Walmart have played a leading role in the index\u2019s rise, expanding the market\u2019s base beyond the tech stock-driven market.\u201d\nCaterpillar, the world\u2019s largest construction equipment manufacturer, also contributed to the Dow Jones index\u2019s rise. Caterpillar is called a \u2018wind vane of the global economy\u2019 as it supplies equipment to construction sites and mines worldwide. In its fourth-quarter results for last year, announced on the 29th of last month, sales reached $17.2 billion, 0.3% higher than expected. Although earnings growth was not remarkable, the market is focusing on traditional industrial stocks like Caterpillar absorbing massive funds withdrawn from tech stocks. Reuters reported, \u201cAs investors look for stocks beyond tech, the Dow Jones has outperformed other indices this year,\u201d adding, \u201cThis movement shows the market is expanding into the industrial sector, which benefits from a robust economy.\u201d\nBecause of this, Wall Street is evaluating that this rally reflects a \u2018healthy rotation\u2019 where other stocks within sectors also rise. The concentration in big tech, which drove the stock market for the past 10 months, is easing, and funds are spreading across the real economy, including industrials and consumer goods.\nChuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services, analyzed, \u201cThe recent driving force of the stock market is the expansion phenomenon where funds, which had been limited to specific tech stocks like AI, are spreading widely across the market.\u201d Barrons analyzed, \u201cWhile large tech stocks showed weakness, the Dow Jones has firmly established itself as a leader in \u2018relative strength,\u2019\u201d adding, \u201cThis was driven by the solid technical strength shown by the Dow Jones and its constituent stocks.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has entered a clear correction phase, falling more than 1% for three consecutive days from the 3rd. This is because big tech companies are pouring astronomical costs into building AI data centers, but concerns are growing that there is no clear profit model. CNBC diagnosed, \u201cThe fea"

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 87 points, or 0.2%.\nThe moves come after the major averages bounced back Friday following sizable losses suffered earlier in the week. The rout was sparked by a sell-off in the tech sector, led by software stocks. Bitcoin also plunged before recovering some as investors took a risk-off posture.\nIn the prior session, the 30-stock Dow industrials surged 1,200 points, or about 2.5%, to score its first close above 50,000 after hitting that level for the first time earlier in intraday trading. The S&P 500 rose about 2% and the Nasdaq Composite finished more than 2% higher.\nBitcoin broke back above $70,000 on Friday after sinking below $61,000 Thursday night, while software stocks such as Salesforce finished higher. Overall, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) jumped 3.5%, marking the fund's first day of gains since the end of last month, when it entered bear market territory.\n\"After an eight-day losing streak, buyers finally stepped back into the software space on Friday, underpinning a much-needed relief rally as the tech sector approached key support near the November lows,\" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. \"While this marked a step in the right direction, the broader tech complex remains rangebound until it can decisively break above the December highs.\"\n\"For the broader market to make sustainable progress, renewed tech participation will likely be essential,\" he also said, adding that he anticipates the S&P 500 will have some trouble reaching 7,000 without more participation from tech, especially software.\nOn Wednesday, investors will be watching for the delayed January jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The release was initially scheduled for last Friday but was postponed due to the partial government shutdown. It also comes after ADP reported last week that private payrolls increased by a mere 22,000 in January, well below expectations. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate the closely watched jobs report will show a gain of 55,000 in January.\nThe January consumer price index reading \u2014 which was also delayed by the shutdown \u2014 is due out Friday.\nThe market's recent rotation out of tech could play out again this week, if the week's earnings releases are favorable. Coca-Cola and Ford Motor are both slated to report on Tuesday."

                "body": "The FTSE 100 contains a very limited number of stocks that have AI exposure. But as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, shares across the board are in danger of sinking as worries over a tech bubble grow.\nCould stock markets experience a full-blown crash? It\u2019s not out of the question, with Deutsche Bank saying recent share price weakness \u201cechoes what we saw in 2000 as the dot-com bubble started to burst\u201c.\nHistory repeating?\nThe German bank served up some interesting food for thought for investors. It noted that\nequities started to fall from the March 2000 as tech stocks saw significant declines [though] consumer staples, utilities and healthcare rallied significantly over the months ahead.\nBut that\u2019s where the good news largely ended. After commenting that \u201ca market can absorb a prolonged rotation without obvious index-level stress for some time,\u201d it added that\nthe longer and deeper the sell-off in a dominant sector becomes, the harder it is for the broader index to withstand the drag, and the continued losses for tech in 2000 ultimately meant the S&P 500 ended that year over 10% lower.\nEven the non-tech-heavy FTSE 100 dropped 14% over the course of 2000. Could we be about to see history repeating itself?\nSupercharging returns\nAccurately predicting the near-term movements of stock markets is notoriously difficult. But given the heightened level of investor tension right now, a market correction could well be around the corner.\nSeeing the value of one\u2019s portfolio plummet isn\u2019t a nice experience. But I won\u2019t be panicking if I see share prices begin to sour. Nor will I be selling everything and running for the hills. Instead, I\u2019ll be looking for quality stocks to buy that may have crashed in the mayhem.\nThis is because I buy shares to hold over the long term. And history shows us that stock markets have always rebounded strongly over time. Past performance isn\u2019t a guarantee of future returns, but buying oversold shares after a crash can supercharge an investor\u2019s eventual returns.\nThree FTSE shares on my radar\nThe FTSE 100\u2019s 19% rise over the last year has left a lot of top stocks looking expensive. My plan is to pile in if they slump in value in the coming weeks or months.\nUnilever is one share I\u2019ll be looking to buy. The consumer goods giant trades on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21 times, above the 10-year average of 17. I\u2019ll also consider snapping up AstraZeneca \u2014 its P/E for 2026 is 25.1, miles above the long-term average of 18.7.\nBut number one on my list is HSBC (LSE:HSBA). I already its hold shares, but the firm\u2019s high valuation has discouraged me from adding more. A 40% price rise over six months has pushed its price-to-book (P/B) ratio to 1.6. That\u2019s double the 10-year average of 0.8, and shows the bank trading at a premium to the value of its assets.\nThe bank\u2019s dividend yield has also dropped to 4.4% from the long-term reading of 6.5%.\nHSBC shares could experience some volatility if the stock market crashes and the global economy plunges. But I\u2019m confident it will rise strongly over the long term, powered by rampant profits growth in its Asian markets."

The EUR/USD pair acts as an amplifier:\n- **Weaker euro** \u2192 Supports exporters (VW, BMW, Siemens, BASF) via improved global competitiveness and better earnings translation.\n- **Stronger euro** \u2192 Squeezes margins, especially when global demand is tepid.\n\nTraders are now watching EUR/USD alongside DAX futures as a core strategy\u2014intraday reactions to ECB comments or US data are often tick-for-tick.\n\n**Sector Check \u2013 Old Economy Pain vs. New Economy Power**\n\n**Autos Under Pressure**\nVolkswagen, BMW, Mercedes face a triple headwind:\n- **EV transition costs** \u2013 Heavy capex, legacy structures ill-suited for full electrification.\n- **China competition** \u2013 Aggressive EV pricing and shifting consumer preferences eroding premium market share.\n- **Regulatory pressure** \u2013 Stricter EU emissions rules forcing more investment just to stay compliant.\n\nMargins are squeezed, restructuring is constant, and investor sentiment remains cautious.\n\n**Tech & Industrials \u2013 The New Engine?**\nNames like SAP and Siemens are attracting buyers on dovish ECB expectations, as lower rates improve future cash flow valuations. However, these sectors are not immune to global growth slowdowns or renewed inflation fears.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n- **German industrial weakness** \u2013 Soft manufacturing orders and production data signal structural challenges.\n- **Global growth deceleration** \u2013 Could further pressure export-dependent DAX components.\n- **Energy price volatility** \u2013 Any flare-up could reignite inflation concerns and force a hawkish ECB pivot.\n\n**Bottom Line**\nGER40 is in a \"dangerous zone\" where macro headlines can flip the script instantly. Bulls see oversold conditions and potential ECB support; bears see earnings risk and structural headwinds. The path forward will be dictated by ECB policy clarity, euro stability, and German economic resilience.",

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic high?tension mode: not in full panic, not in full euphoria, but in that dangerous zone where every headline about the ECB, the euro, or German industry can flip the script. Price action is showing energetic swings around crucial areas, with German bulls and global macro bears battling for control in real time.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch the latest DAX 40 breakdowns from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll through fresh Instagram vibes on German stock market trends\n- Swipe into viral TikTok strategies for active DAX trading\nThe Story: The DAX 40 right now is a pure macro theater play. To understand the risk and the opportunity, you have to look beyond the candles and into three main drivers: the ECB, the euro, and Germany\u2019s real economy.\n1. ECB Policy \u2013 Christine Lagarde vs. The Cycle\nThe European Central Bank is the DAX\u2019s invisible market maker. Every word from Christine Lagarde can flip futures overnight. The setup right now is a tug-of-war between inflation that is coming down from peak levels, and growth that looks fragile \u2013 especially in Germany.\nHere\u2019s the critical logic for DAX traders:\n- When the ECB sounds hawkish (worried about sticky inflation, hinting at tighter-for-longer policy), European bond yields tend to stay elevated, which pressures equity valuations. Cyclical sectors on the DAX \u2013 autos, industrials, financials \u2013 often feel that weight first.\n- When the ECB turns more dovish (emphasizing weak growth, recession risk, or the need to support credit conditions), equity bulls usually lean in. Rate cut hopes are a classic rocket fuel for stock indices, especially for rate-sensitive names like real estate and growth-heavy plays like tech and software.\nThe current phase is messy: the ECB can\u2019t fully declare victory on inflation, but it also can\u2019t ignore deteriorating data from Germany. That uncertainty keeps volatility alive and creates exactly the type of environment where swing traders thrive and investors get chopped up if they chase late moves.\n2. Euro vs. USD \u2013 The Hidden DAX Lever\nThe DAX is not just a German story; it\u2019s a global exporter story. Think about it like this: every major DAX multinational is effectively running a huge currency trade under the hood.\n- Weaker euro vs. USD tends to be supportive for the DAX in the medium term. German exporters like auto makers, industrials, and chemical giants become more competitive abroad, and their overseas earnings translate back into more euros. That can help earnings even if volumes are not exploding.\n- Stronger euro can be a headwind for those exporters. Margins get squeezed, and the market gets nervous about earnings revisions.\nRight now, the euro has been fluctuating in a choppy range against the USD, not in a one-way trend. For the DAX, this means no clean tailwind, but also not a full-on currency headwind. Instead, FX is acting like an amplifier: whenever macro data or ECB talk pushes the euro sharply one way, DAX reactions get exaggerated.\nFor active traders, this is huge: watching EUR/USD alongside DAX futures is no longer optional \u2013 it\u2019s core strategy. Intraday, you can often see the DAX react almost tick-for-tick when the euro spikes on an ECB comment or a surprise US data print.\n3. The Sector Check \u2013 Classic Germany vs. New Germany\nThe DAX 40 has a split personality: old economy vs. new economy. And that split is exactly where today\u2019s risk and opportunity show up.\nAutos (VW, BMW, Mercedes) \u2013 Under Pressure\nThe German auto trio is battling on multiple fronts:\n- EV transition stress: Massive capex needs, "

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic tug-of-war mode: German blue chips swinging between cautious optimism and macro anxiety. No clean breakout, no brutal collapse \u2013 more like a nervous grind where every ECB headline, every PMI print, and every energy price move can flip the mood from bullish to defensive in a heartbeat. Traders are watching crucial zones where German bulls keep trying to defend the uptrend while macro bears are waiting to sell every bounce.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX chart breakdowns and trading plans on YouTube\n- Scroll Instagram for the latest German stock market mood and memes\n- Hit TikTok for fast-paced DAX trading strategies and day-trade ideas\nThe Story: The DAX 40 is not moving in a vacuum. If you want to trade it like a pro instead of guessing, you have to understand the three big drivers: the ECB, the German macro picture, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB Policy: Lagarde vs. Inflation vs. Growth\nThe European Central Bank is still the main puppet master for the DAX. Whenever Christine Lagarde steps up to the mic, DAX traders stop breathing for a few minutes. The whole market is trying to price the balance between inflation risk and recession risk.\nThe core narrative right now:\n- Inflation in the eurozone has cooled from the extreme spikes but is still a potential problem if energy prices flare up again.\n- Growth data, especially from Germany, looks fragile: weak orders, soft industrial output, and nervous corporate guidance.\n- The ECB is stuck in a classic dilemma: cut too fast and risk another inflation wave, or stay too tight and risk breaking already struggling economies like Germany.\nFor the DAX, this tension is everything. When markets expect more rate cuts, growth and tech-heavy names like SAP and Siemens tend to attract buyers as future cash flows get discounted at lower rates. When the market fears the ECB will stay restrictive for longer, financials and cyclicals get shaky and index rallies start to fade.\nEuro vs. USD: The Stealth Lever on the DAX\nDo not ignore the EUR/USD pair. It quietly changes the game for German exporters:\n- A weaker euro makes German products cheaper globally, which is supportive for exporters like VW, BMW, Mercedes, Siemens, and industrial leaders.\n- A stronger euro squeezes margins when sales are in dollars but costs are in euros, pressuring earnings and, in turn, the DAX.\nSo when you look at the DAX chart, you are basically trading a three-way mix: ECB expectations, euro strength or weakness, and global risk appetite for equities.\n2. Sector Check: Old Economy Pain vs. New Economy Power\nThe DAX is not just \u201cGermany Inc.\u201d \u2013 it is a split personality index.\nGerman Auto Industry: The Struggle is Real\nIcons like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are no longer unstoppable machines. They are getting attacked from every angle:\n- China competition: Chinese EV makers are pushing aggressively into Europe, undercutting prices and changing consumer tastes. German carmakers, who used to dominate premium segments, are now forced to fight for relevance and margins.\n- EV transition costs: Shifting from combustion engines to electric vehicles is expensive. Legacy factories, supply chains, and labor structures are not built for a fully electric world. That means pressure on profits, layoffs, and constant restructuring headlines \u2013 none of which scream \u201cbuy me now\u201d to investors.\n- Regulation and climate policy: EU rules on emissions are getting stricter, which forces automakers to invest even more in new tech just to stay compliant.\nResult: The auto sector often a"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full drama mode \u2013 German blue chips are swinging between resilient comebacks and sudden risk-off waves. We are not talking quiet sideways chop; this is a serious tug-of-war between cautious bears and aggressive dip buyers, with price action testing major zones where bulls and bears are fighting for control.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive DAX 40 breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll through fresh German stock market trends on Instagram\n- See viral DAX trading setups and memes on TikTok\nThe Story: The DAX 40 is currently the purest expression of Europe\u2019s identity crisis: is this still the old-school industrial powerhouse, or has Germany quietly turned into a tech-and-export beta play on global liquidity?\nOn the macro side, everything revolves around one institution: the European Central Bank. Traders are glued to every word from ECB press conferences, trying to decode whether policy makers are more scared of sticky inflation or a deeper recession in Germany and the eurozone.\nThe logic is simple but brutal:\n- If the ECB signals a more dovish stance, talking about potential rate cuts or at least a pause, equity markets across Europe tend to breathe. Financial conditions ease, growth stocks and cyclicals get a bid, and the DAX often reacts with powerful relief moves.\n- If the tone turns hawkish again \u2013 strong inflation language, warnings about loosening policy too fast \u2013 then risk assets, especially economically sensitive names in the DAX, often come under pressure as discount rates rise and recession worries resurface.\nThe Euro/USD pair is the second key lever. A softer euro often acts as a tailwind for the export-heavy DAX, because German giants in autos, chemicals, and industrials become more competitive abroad when the currency is weaker. A stronger euro, on the other hand, can weigh on margins and sentiment, especially when global demand is not firing on all cylinders.\nRight now, many traders see a tricky combination: euro moves are choppy, reacting to every macro headline out of the US and the ECB, while German data is sending mixed signals. On one side, there are signs of stabilization in some surveys and expectations. On the other side, hard data like industrial production and manufacturing orders still point to structural challenges for Europe\u2019s largest economy.\nThe DAX 40 becomes the battlefield where all these cross-currents collide. Bulls argue that a lot of bad news is already priced in: energy shocks, weak manufacturing, geopolitical risks, and a sluggish consumer. Bears counter that earnings expectations remain too optimistic, especially if global growth downshifts again and Germany fails to re-ignite its industrial engine.\nOverlay that with central-bank-driven liquidity flows and you get exactly what we see now: high-energy swings, violent rallies when risk-on flows arrive, and sharp pullbacks whenever the narrative pivots back to recession fears or sticky inflation.\nSector Check: Autos vs. Tech/Industrials \u2013 Who Is Carrying the DAX?\nThe DAX is no longer just a car index, but the auto sector still dominates the narrative. Names like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are battling a triple-headwind:\n- EV Transition Pressure: European automakers are under massive competitive pressure from US and Chinese electric vehicle players. Margins are squeezed, capex is heavy, and investors are questioning whether the traditional manufacturers can keep up with software, batteries, and platform innovation.\n- Demand Uncertainty: Higher interest rates, cautious consumers, and global economic"

                "body": "In 2026, investors appear to be getting more cautious about companies that they think spend too much on artificial intelligence (AI) without results, and on stocks that trade at high valuations. Both of these concerns have had an outsize impact on technology stocks, particularly large caps. The large-cap tech sector is down about 3% in 2026 as of Feb. 4, which is the worst among the sectors.\nThe bigger concern, from my perspective, particularly as it relates to many of the large-cap tech companies, is the valuations. The inflation-adjusted 10-year Shiller P/E ratio is at its highest level since the dot-com boom, sitting at just over 40.\nIn the past, an abnormally high Shiller P/E ratio has been a strong indicator that a market correction is coming. We aren't there yet, but it bears watching closely.\nSo, in 2026, investors should focus on tech stocks that are both positioned to capitalize on AI spending and are reasonably valued. Two stocks that stand out are Microsoft (MSFT +2.00%) and Oracle (ORCL +4.64%).\nWhy Microsoft stands out\nLet's start with Microsoft, the top choice among the two stocks. Microsoft had some pullback after its fiscal second-quarter earnings in late January due to record spending on capital expenditures, mostly AI, last quarter, which was 66% higher than it was the same quarter a year ago.\nNASDAQ: MSFT\nKey Data Points\nAt the same time, growth for its AI cloud engine, Azure, slowed slightly and was guided to slow a bit more in 2026. But it is more a case of supply constraints than demand as the remaining performance obligation rose 110% to $625 billion.\nThe pullback is great for long-term investors because it makes Microsoft even more attractive. It is trading at 26 times earnings, which is the lowest it has been since 2022 and below the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 averages.\nSome 95% of analysts rate Microsoft a buy, the most of any S&P 500 stock, and it has a median price target of $600 per share, suggesting 45% upside.\nOracle has huge upside, but...\nOracle stock has even higher potential upside than Microsoft, according to Wall Street analysts, with a median price target of around $272 per share, which would mean 88% upside over the next 12 months.\nNYSE: ORCL\nKey Data Points\nLike Microsoft, it is also undervalued relative to its peers, trading at around 29 times earnings, which is near a 52-week low.\nTo a greater degree than Microsoft, investors are concerned about Oracle's AI spending. It announced in early February that it was raising $50 billion to build new data centers to meet its massive cloud computing demand. As of January, it had a $523 billion backlog of contracts in the pipeline, up a whopping 438% year over year. Its clients include a who's who of hyperscalers like Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI, which inked a five-year $300 billion deal with Oracle.\nBut again, there have been investor concerns about OpenAI\u02bbs ability to fund that contract, which has hurt Oracle stock a bit.\nOracle is more of a gamble than Microsoft because of the debt it is taking on and the OpenAI concentration in the pipeline, but it has a ton of upside and looks good from a valuation standpoint."

                "body": "Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Just Reported Annual Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?\nLast week, you might have seen that Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) released its yearly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 3.9% to US$145 in the past week. Manhattan Associates reported US$1.1b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.60 beat expectations, being 4.5% higher than what the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\nAfter the latest results, the eleven analysts covering Manhattan Associates are now predicting revenues of US$1.15b in 2026. If met, this would reflect an okay 6.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to reduce 3.9% to US$3.53 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$1.15b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.67 in 2026. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Manhattan Associates\nThe consensus price target held steady at US$213, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Manhattan Associates analyst has a price target of US$240 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$160. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Manhattan Associates' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 6.0% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 15% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Manhattan Associates."

Together with coalition partner Ishin, the ruling bloc has secured a two-thirds supermajority, allowing it to override the upper house and push legislation through without opposition support.\nMarkets read the emphatic result as providing a stable political base for Takaichi\u2019s ambitious fiscal agenda, including higher public spending and promised tax relief. Japanese equities responded sharply. The Nikkei 225 jumped to a record above 57,300, while the broader Topix surged to an all-time high above 3,825. Japanese government bonds sold off, with yields rising on expectations of increased issuance and reflationary policy momentum.\nThe yen reaction was more nuanced. The initial response in early trade was renewed weakness, with the currency sliding to an all-time low against the Swiss franc and USD/JPY briefly probing above 157.70. However, intervention rhetoric quickly tempered the move.\nOver the weekend, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama warned markets against excessive currency moves, saying she stood ready to communicate with markets and remained in close contact with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on dollar-yen stability. On Monday, Japan\u2019s top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura reinforced the message, saying authorities were watching FX developments \u201cwith a high sense of urgency\u201d and remained in constant dialogue with markets.

Yields on the 10-year Japanese government bonds rose nearly 4 basis points to 2.274%, while yields on 20-year JGBs added about 3 basis points to 3.158%.\nTakaichi's administration has gained stronger momentum to pursue a major shift toward proactive fiscal policy, backed by a clear public mandate, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB echoed in a note following her victory.\nU.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory in a TruthSocial post.\n\"She is a highly respected and very popular Leader. Sanae's bold and wise decision to call for an Election paid off big time,\" he wrote. \"The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.\"\nThe election follows political upheaval last year, when the LDP lost its majority in the Upper House, and a Lower House defeat in 2024, which prompted then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to resign in September.\nOther Asian markets also traded higher, with South Korea's Kospi jumping 4.15%, while the small-cap Kosdaq added 2.97%.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.65% in early trading.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.5%, while the mainland's CSI 300 climbed 0.9%.\nU.S. futures inched higher in early Asia hours.\nLast Friday in the U.S., stocks surged as tech names recovered following several days of heavy selling in the sector and bitcoin rebounded following a rout that took the popular cryptocurrency down more than 50% from its high in October last year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%, closing at 50,115.67.
