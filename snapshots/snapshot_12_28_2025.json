                "body": "BRICS \u2014 a significant economic bloc of emerging nations comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2014 is fast shifting its reliance on the US Dollar to gold through the accumulation of the precious metal. Although officially BRICS nations hold around 20% of the global gold reserves, they, along with their strategically allied states (who are not BRICS members but have strong ties with BRICS member countries), now collectively hold around 50% of the global gold production.\nRussia and China are leading from the front in this strategy. In 2024, China produced 380 tonnes of gold, while Russia contributed 340 tonnes. Following this strategy, in September 2025, Brazil purchased 16 tonnes of gold, marking its first gold purchase since 2021.\nExplaining the dual strategy of BRICS member countries, Anuj Gupta, Director at Ya Wealth, said, \u201cBRICS member countries are both producing more gold and selling less. At the same time, they are also purchasing gold from the international market. According to existing data, between 2020 and 2024, the Central Banks of the respective BRICS nations purchased more than 50% of the global gold, information that US President Donald Trump may not like to hear.\u201d\nDecoding this BRICS dual strategy on gold, Sachin Jasuja, Head of Equities and Founding Partner, Centricity WealthTech, said, \"The increasing control of gold reserves and gold purchases by BRICS nations is emerging as a meaningful signal of stress within the US Dollar-dominated global financial order. While the US Dollar remains the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, recent developments suggest that its uncontested supremacy is being gradually questioned rather than abruptly challenged.\"\nToday, BRICS economies account for nearly 30% of global trade, giving their collective monetary choices global relevance. A long-standing objective of the bloc has been to reduce its reliance on Western financial infrastructure, particularly the US dollar, for trade settlement and reserve purposes.\nHighlighting the developments that led to the germination of this shift in BRICS member nations' thinking, Jasuja added, \"The decisive shift in thinking followed the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, when Western governments froze a substantial portion of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. This episode fundamentally altered how sovereign nations perceive reserve safety. It demonstrated that reserves held in dollar-denominated assets or foreign jurisdictions are exposed to geopolitical risk if political alignment breaks down. Since then, reserve management has increasingly prioritised assets that are politically neutral, physically held, and immune to external control.\"\nSachin Jasuja said that BRICS central banks have been among the most aggressive buyers, with China, Russia, and India now ranking among the world\u2019s largest official gold holders. As a result, gold\u2019s share in BRICS foreign exchange reserves has steadily increased, while exposure to dollar assets has moderated at the margin. This reserve shift has coincided with a sharp and sustained rally in gold prices, reflecting not only inflation hedging but also strong official demand. The price action suggests markets are increasingly recognising gold\u2019s renewed role as the ultimate reserve asset in a fragmented financial system\u2014one where trust in reserve currencies is no longer unconditional.\n\"BRICS nations have been actively reducing dollar dependence in trade. Over the past decade, the share of intra-BRICS trade settled in local currencies has risen steadily, with roughly one-third of such trade now bypassing the dollar. Bilateral arrangements\u2014such as India\u2013Russia and China\u2013Brazil trade in local currencies\u2014illustrate a pragmatic shift aimed at lowering transaction costs, reducing exposure to sanctions, and limiting dependence on dollar liquidity cycles,\" said Jasuja.\nAsked about the outcome of this dual strategy on gold adopted by BRICS members and their allied states, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, \"BRICS in"

                "url": "https://www.investopedia.com/gold-prices-surge-to-new-heights-heres-why-warren-buffett-has-been-a-skeptic-11875952",
                "body": "Key Takeaways\n- Gold prices have surged to new all-time highs in 2025.\n- The current gold surge is fueled by inflation, economic risks, and the threat to the Federal Reserve's independence.\n- Buffett has called gold an \"unproductive\u201d asset that doesn\u2019t generate income.\n- Berkshire had a brief gold mining stake in 2020.\nIn 2025, gold prices are the highest they've ever been, as both investors and central banks increase their holdings to hedge against inflation, economic risks, and the threat to the Federal Reserve's independence.12 However, legendary investor Warren Buffett has voiced skepticism about gold as a long-term investment.\nIn this article, we revisit what Buffett has said about gold, examine his brief pivot into gold mining during the pandemic, and explore when gold might make sense in a long-term portfolio.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Skepticism About Gold\nBuffett has been critical of gold as an investment. In his 2011 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he described gold as \u201dneither of much use nor procreative,\u201d emphasizing that it does not produce cash flow or create value over time.3\nSimilarly, Buffett remarked in a 2011 interview with CNBC that \u201cgold is a way of going along on fear.\u201d4 That is, the price of gold relies on market sentiment and demand. When people grow more fearful of the economy, demand for gold rises and its price increases. And when people become less fearful, demand falls, and its price decreases. Ultimately, Buffett\u2019s preference is for assets that generate cash flow and compound over time.\nThe 2020 Surprise: Berkshire\u2019s Brief Bet on Gold Mining\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it held a $565 million stake in one of the largest gold mining companies in the world, Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: B).\nThis decision may have been surprising given Buffett\u2019s previous statements about gold. While it may have been the decision of one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, and not Buffet himself, it was still a notable and industry-altering decision at the time.5\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s position in the gold mining company was relatively short-lived.6 The company sold off its shares of Barrick Gold by the end of Q4 2020.\nWhy Gold Is Surging Now\nIn 2025, the price of gold has risen to all-time highs as macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and political tensions have made the metal attractive.7\nHowever, today\u2019s economic environment contrasts with the low-inflation, less volatile environment at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, right before Berkshire Hathaway invested in Barrick Gold in the second quarter of 2020. At that time, inflation was hovered around historically-low levels as the pandemic weighed on global economic activity.8 More recently, inflation has dropped considerably from a historic high of 9% in June 2022. As of November 2025, it was at 2.7%.9\nStill, inflation sits above the two-percent mark that economists strive for. As inflation remains elevated, some investors might find gold attractive as a safe haven in an increasingly uncertain economy.\nRelated Stories\nWhen Might Gold Make Sense\u2014Even for a Buffett-Inspired Investor?\nWhile Buffett largely avoids gold, some scenarios may justify a modest allocation in your portfolio. For example, investors seeking portfolio diversification, insurance against market volatility, or assets that are not correlated with equities might consider investing in gold.\n\u201cFor investors focused on growth and income, I recommend a 90-10 stocks-bonds split, with up to 2.5 percentage points of the 90% allocated to gold as a hedge against inflation,\u201d certified financial planner and chartered financial consultant Laura DiFiglio of Northwestern Mutual told Investopedia via email.\nHow to Think About Gold in a Long-Term Portfolio\nIt\u2019s crucial to weigh the opportunity cost and current market volatility when considering adding gold to your portfolio.

                "body": "Gold prices are on a remarkable run, notching their seventh consecutive week of gains as of October 4, 2025, driven by mounting economic uncertainty in the United States and a swirl of regulatory changes in the Thai financial markets. The convergence of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, shifting expectations for Federal Reserve interest rates, and heightened scrutiny of short selling in Thailand has created a complex landscape for investors worldwide.\nAccording to a report by Reuters, spot gold prices rose by 0.7% to $3,884.19 per ounce at 13:40 Eastern Time (17:49 GMT), hovering just below an all-time high of $3,896.49 set the day before. U.S. gold futures for December delivery closed up more than 1%, settling at $3,908.90 per ounce. This surge marks a more than 3% increase in the past week alone, underscoring gold\u2019s reputation as a safe haven asset in times of turmoil.\nThe backdrop to this rally is the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, now entering its third day, which has rattled markets and left investors searching for stability. With no clear resolution in sight, both Democratic and Republican Senate plans to reopen the government remain in limbo. The resulting uncertainty has only added fuel to gold\u2019s ascent. As Jim Wyckoff, a senior analyst at Kitco Metals, told Reuters, \"The longer the government remains shut down, the more it supports the gold market. If there\u2019s a surprise deal over the weekend to reopen the government, that could be a negative factor.\"\nAdding to the uncertainty, a key U.S. nonfarm payrolls report\u2014typically a major indicator for investors\u2014was postponed due to the shutdown. Without this data, market participants have been forced to rely on alternative signals, many of which point to a cooling labor market and reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates. According to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, investors are now pricing in a 97% chance of a 0.25% rate cut in October and an 85% chance of another cut in December.\nGold\u2019s performance has been nothing short of spectacular this year, rising over 47% so far in 2025. UBS, in a recent note, projected that gold could climb to $4,200 per ounce in the coming months, citing the decreasing opportunity cost of holding gold as U.S. real interest rates fall and the U.S. dollar weakens. \"The opportunity cost of holding gold is declining as U.S. real interest rates fall, while the forecast for a weaker U.S. dollar further supports gold prices,\" the bank noted.\nOther precious metals have also seen gains, albeit more modest. Spot silver surged 2.1% to $47.96 per ounce, platinum jumped 2.4% to $1,606.29 per ounce, and palladium increased 1.5% to $1,259.41 per ounce. The upward trend across the board highlights a broader search for safe assets amid global market jitters.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the globe, the Thai financial markets are grappling with their own set of challenges. As reported by Bangkok Biz News, concerns over the impact of short selling on stock market volatility have prompted Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) to tighten regulations. The agencies have been working together to close loopholes and enhance transparency, aiming to bolster investor confidence in the Thai capital market.\nShort selling, the practice of borrowing shares to sell them with the intention of buying them back at a lower price, has long been a double-edged sword. While it can increase market liquidity and provide a tool for hedging risk, it can also exacerbate price declines and fuel volatility\u2014especially in less liquid markets. The debate has intensified in Thailand as trading volumes and stock prices have slumped compared to other regional markets, with some investors pointing fingers at short selling as a key culprit.\nIn response, the SEC and SET have enacted a series of measures. These include restricting short selling to only the most liquid stocks\u2014those in the SET100 Index and certai"

What has changed is where traders look for short-term cues. Increasingly, those cues are coming from China, not because Beijing controls supply, but because its buying behavior now dominates marginal demand and near-term price discovery.\nAs reported by Reuters, China has overtaken OPEC as the most influential force in oil price formation, driven by the scale and timing of its crude purchases rather than any formal attempt to manage prices. The change shows us how oil markets have become increasingly demand-led, with China sitting right in the center.\nChina is the world\u2019s largest crude importer, but its influence extends beyond just the volumes that make headlines.\nRefinitiv analysts recently noted that the traditional view of producers like OPEC+ as the primary oil price setters has been \u201cchallenged in 2025 by China,\u201d explaining that Beijing\u2019s use of strategic stockpiles to provide a crude price floor and ceiling effectively supplanted producer group direction this year. citeanalyst voices added, I can provide additional options.\nRelated: Geopolitics Lifts Oil Prices in Thin Holiday Trading\nUnlike OECD buyers, China\u2019s oil system blends state-owned majors, independent refiners, and strategic stockpiling entities whose buying behavior is opaque and often poorly reflected in real-time data. Cargoes can move into commercial storage, strategic reserves, or floating storage with limited visibility. That uncertainty itself has become a market variable.\nWhen Chinese buying accelerates, prices tend to firm even if global supply remains healthy. When imports slow, prices drop even with OPEC output restraint. Over the past two years, this pattern has repeated enough times that traders now treat Chinese import momentum as a more immediate price driver than OPEC production targets, many of which are either anticipated or only partially implemented.\nOPEC (and particularly Saudi Arabia) still controls the bulk of global spare capacity. That capacity continues to anchor longer-term expectations. But spare capacity matters less when demand fluctuations dominate short-term pricing. In today\u2019s market, the marginal barrel is shaped more by whether China is actively pulling crude from the market.\nChinese refinery margins have become an early indicator for price direction. When margins improve, especially among independent refiners, crude imports typically rise. When margins tighten, buying slows quickly. Because these refiners operate with short planning cycles and limited balance-sheet flexibility, their behavior introduces volatility that OPEC policy cannot easily smooth.\nGeopolitics also throws itself in the mix here, with China increasing crude intake from Russia and other sanctioned suppliers under alternative pricing arrangements, weakening the link between OPEC decisions and spot prices by shifting trade into channels where supply discipline and benchmark signaling are less effective.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t mean that OPEC is irrelevant. The cartel\u2019s policy decisions still shape the medium-term balance and set boundaries for price expectations. But the market\u2019s center of gravity has shifted, with traders now watching Chinese customs data, refinery runs, and policy cues with the same intensity once reserved for OPEC communiqu\u00e9s.\nNone of this means that China has replaced producers as the ultimate price setter. China\u2019s influence operates at the margin and in the short term, not in moments of genuine supply stress. Strategic stockpiling and opaque buying can move prices when barrels are abundant, but they cannot cap prices during a true supply shock, nor defend a floor once inventories normalize and demand slows.\nWhen markets tighten, pricing power reverts quickly to those who control spare capacity. On that front, OPEC (and primarily, Saudi Arabia) still holds the decisive lever. China\u2019s"

                "body": "Peak Oil: Why the world can't break its fossil fuel habit\n17 hours agoPeak Oil once struck fear into policymakers, businesses and consumers as a looming moment when the world might suck the last drops of black gold from the ground, like a straw reaching the bottom of a milkshake.\nThe idea was popularized in the 1950s by geologist M. King Hubbert, who warned that US oil production would follow a bell\u2011shaped curve and eventually hit an unavoidable peak as fields matured and declined.\nClimate change has flipped the narrative in recent years. Instead of the fear of scarcity, the debate now centers on when demand will finally peak as the shift to electric vehicles (EV) and other cleaner energy gathers pace.\nAt the same time, political pushback, from delays to combustion\u2011engine car bans to rollbacks of EV subsidies, is casting doubt on how fast that transition from fossil fuels will actually happen.\nExperts divided on when demand will peak\nOpposing views have emerged about when global oil demand will start to decline.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based body representing major oil-consuming nations, projects that demand will flatten to around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030. In its World Energy Outlook 2025, published last month, the IEA's main Stated Policies Scenario assumes governments follow through on ambitious energy and climate goals.\nOPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, takes the opposite view. In its latest long\u2011term outlook, the oil producer group forecasts that demand will continue to rise for decades and sees no peak before 2050, projecting consumption will reach nearly 123 million bpd by mid\u2011century.\nThe organizations share one underlying concern: Supply is becoming harder to sustain. OPEC believes that robust demand growth will justify steady investment to ensure ample reserves from its members for decades to come. The IEA, by contrast, offers a more restrained outlook.\n'Business as usual' scenario revived\nUnder pressure from the Trump administration, the agency reinstated its more conservative Current Policies Scenario, which was dropped in 2020 and is based on current laws and observable trends that fall far short of climate ambitions.\nThis scenario suggests that supply growth will slow after 2028 as non-OPEC sources such as the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada wane. That would leave supply reliant on Middle East OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.\nOil demand could rise to 113 million bpd by 2050 if climate pledges remain unimplemented, the IEA warned.\nFranziska Holz, deputy head of the energy, transportation and environment department at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin), said reinstating the conservative scenario was a \"positive\" as it proves that the world is \"not on track with our climate targets ... [and] not fast enough in replacing fossil fuels in our energy mix.\"\nHolz quipped that the \"Americans had probably not intended that\" when they leaned on the IEA to reinstate the more cautious scenario.\nNew oil discoveries hit rock bottom\nWhen it comes to Peak Oil, both organizations point to the same underlying risk: Oil supply won't take care of itself. Older fields are declining fast and, without steady investment, production from existing sites will drop by about 8% a year, the IEA warned in November.\nHuge amounts of new output is required just to keep the global oil supply flat. Yet most spending is devoted to offsetting declines from aging fields rather than bringing significant new production online.\nWith discoveries at historic lows and growing reliance on fast\u2011depleting shale and deepwater wells, the oil sector is increasingly running just to stay still.\nAntonio Turiel, a physicist and Peak Oil researcher at Spain\u2019s CSIC institute, told DW that the US fracking boom, the engine of non\u2011OPEC growth, is nearing exhaustion.

Over the past two years, this pattern has repeated enough times that traders now treat Chinese import momentum as a more immediate price driver than OPEC production targets, many of which are either anticipated or only partially implemented.\nOPEC (and particularly Saudi Arabia) still controls the bulk of global spare capacity. That capacity continues to anchor longer-term expectations. But spare capacity matters less when demand fluctuations dominate short-term pricing. In today\u2019s market, the marginal barrel is shaped more by whether China is actively pulling crude from the market.\nChinese refinery margins have become an early indicator for price direction. When margins improve, especially among independent refiners, crude imports typically rise. When margins tighten, buying slows quickly. Because these refiners operate with short planning cycles and limited balance-sheet flexibility, their behavior introduces volatility that OPEC policy cannot easily smooth.\nGeopolitics also throws itself in the mix here, with China increasing crude intake from Russia and other sanctioned suppliers under alternative pricing arrangements, weakening the link between OPEC decisions and spot prices by shifting trade into channels where supply discipline and benchmark signaling are less effective.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t mean that OPEC is irrelevant. The cartel\u2019s policy decisions still shape the medium-term balance and set boundaries for price expectations. But the market\u2019s center of gravity has shifted, with traders now watching Chinese customs data, refinery runs, and policy cues with the same intensity once reserved for OPEC communiqu\u00e9s.\nNone of this means that China has replaced producers as the ultimate price setter. China\u2019s influence operates at the margin and in the short term, not in moments of genuine supply stress. Strategic stockpiling and opaque buying can move prices when barrels are abundant, but they cannot cap prices during a true supply shock, nor defend a floor once inventories normalize and demand slows.\nWhen markets tighten, pricing power reverts quickly to those who control spare capacity. On that front, OPEC (and primarily, Saudi Arabia) still holds the decisive lever. China\u2019s"

                "body": "Peak Oil: Why the world can't break its fossil fuel habit\n17 hours agoPeak Oil once struck fear into policymakers, businesses and consumers as a looming moment when the world might suck the last drops of black gold from the ground, like a straw reaching the bottom of a milkshake.\nThe idea was popularized in the 1950s by geologist M. King Hubbert, who warned that US oil production would follow a bell\u2011shaped curve and eventually hit an unavoidable peak as fields matured and declined.\nClimate change has flipped the narrative in recent years. Instead of the fear of scarcity, the debate now centers on when demand will finally peak as the shift to electric vehicles (EV) and other cleaner energy gathers pace.\nAt the same time, political pushback, from delays to combustion\u2011engine car bans to rollbacks of EV subsidies, is casting doubt on how fast that transition from fossil fuels will actually happen.\nExperts divided on when demand will peak\nOpposing views have emerged about when global oil demand will start to decline.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based body representing major oil-consuming nations, projects that demand will flatten to around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030. In its World Energy Outlook 2025, published last month, the IEA's main Stated Policies Scenario assumes governments follow through on ambitious energy and climate goals.\nOPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, takes the opposite view. In its latest long\u2011term outlook, the oil producer group forecasts that demand will continue to rise for decades and sees no peak before 2050, projecting consumption will reach nearly 123 million bpd by mid\u2011century.\nThe organizations share one underlying concern: Supply is becoming harder to sustain. OPEC believes that robust demand growth will justify steady investment to ensure ample reserves from its members for decades to come. The IEA, by contrast, offers a more restrained outlook.\n'Business as usual' scenario revived\nUnder pressure from the Trump administration, the agency reinstated its more conservative Current Policies Scenario, which was dropped in 2020 and is based on current laws and observable trends that fall far short of climate ambitions.\nThis scenario suggests that supply growth will slow after 2028 as non-OPEC sources such as the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada wane. That would leave supply reliant on Middle East OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.\nOil demand could rise to 113 million bpd by 2050 if climate pledges remain unimplemented, the IEA warned.\nFranziska Holz, deputy head of the energy, transportation and environment department at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin), said reinstating the conservative scenario was a \"positive\" as it proves that the world is \"not on track with our climate targets ... [and] not fast enough in replacing fossil fuels in our energy mix.\"\nHolz quipped that the \"Americans had probably not intended that\" when they leaned on the IEA to reinstate the more cautious scenario.\nNew oil discoveries hit rock bottom\nWhen it comes to Peak Oil, both organizations point to the same underlying risk: Oil supply won't take care of itself. Older fields are declining fast and, without steady investment, production from existing sites will drop by about 8% a year, the IEA warned in November.\nHuge amounts of new output is required just to keep the global oil supply flat. Yet most spending is devoted to offsetting declines from aging fields rather than bringing significant new production online.\nWith discoveries at historic lows and growing reliance on fast\u2011depleting shale and deepwater wells, the oil sector is increasingly running just to stay still.\nAntonio Turiel, a physicist and Peak Oil researcher at Spain\u2019s CSIC institute, told DW that the US fracking boom, the engine of non\u2011OPEC growth, is nearing exhaustion. The best drilling spots in the Permian Basin, in Texas and New Mexico, have bee"

Spot EUR/USD touched just under 1.1810 before slipping back toward 1.1772, but the key point is that rallies above 1.17 are now holding instead of being sold, which was not the case earlier in the year. That shift tells you the market has moved from trading a cyclical dollar upswing to testing how far a structural dollar repricing can go as rate and political risk move against the US currency.\nEUR/USD benefits from Fed\u2013ECB rate gap compression with Fed cuts priced, ECB on hold\nRate differentials remain the cleanest fundamental story for EUR/USD. The European Central Bank has locked its deposit facility at 2.0%, with headline euro-area inflation at roughly 2.15% and projections nudged slightly higher, mostly on services. The signal is \u201con hold, not easing fast,\u201d which effectively hardens the euro\u2019s floor. On the other side, the Federal Reserve has already cut its policy rate from 4.00% to 3.75%, and the market is still counting on at least three additional cuts through 2026. That takes the front-end yield advantage of the USD down every quarter and pushes investors to reallocate toward euro-denominated assets. Banks looking ahead talk about EUR/USD grinding toward the 1.24 region by end-2026 on this differential alone, even if the path is choppy.\nEUR/USD positioning is stretched: 145,000 long futures contracts raise correction risk\nSpeculative futures positioning shows how crowded the trade has become. Long non-commercial EUR exposure has climbed to around 145,000 contracts, up from roughly 138,000 and now sitting at a two-year high. That level of positioning is consistent with the current EUR/USD zone near 1.18, but it also increases the risk that any disappointment in Fed-cut timing, ECB tone, or euro-area data triggers a shakeout. Technically and psychologically, the 1.20 area is heavy resistance; with positioning this extended, the pair is vulnerable to a 100\u2013150 pip washout back toward 1.1650\u20131.17 before any sustained push through 1.20 can stick.\nEUR/USD still trades inside a medium-term uptrend but faces 1.1650 downside risk\nShorter-term structure in EUR/USD is not as cleanly bullish as the macro narrative. On the four-hour chart the pair has already completed one leg down to around 1.1702, bounced to roughly 1.1737, and is in the process of building another impulse lower aimed at the 1.1650\u20131.1645 band. Analysts who track wave structure frame this as a developing third downside leg within an uptrend, with 1.1650 as the first major test of whether bulls are willing to defend the move from sub-1.15 lows. Momentum indicators back that caution: MACD on H4 sits below zero with its signal line angled lower, while intraday stochastic readings sit below 50 and point down, both consistent with further pressure toward 1.1650 before dip-buyers reload.\nEUR/USD history shows NFP can flip the narrative quickly when the USD gets a growth shock\nRecent price action around 1.18 in EUR/USD echoes older episodes where US data reset the dollar\u2019s trajectory in a matter of days. When non-farm payrolls previously printed 209,000 versus expectations near 183,000, the USD staged a sharp rebound after weeks of selling, forcing EUR/USD to pull back from around 1.1800 toward the mid-1.17s. The lesson for now is simple: with the pair back near 1.18 and the market positioned heavily long euro, any upside surprise in US jobs, inflation, or growth can still deliver a fast 50\u2013100 pip correction without changing the broader medium-term dollar-bearish story.\nEUR/USD is riding the same macro wave that pushed gold above $4,500 and silver toward $80\nThe dollar\u2019s problem is"

Price is consolidating after a strong pre-Christmas rally that pushed the pair to an 11-week high near $1.35. The current tape shows a marginal day move of about -0.07%, which is exactly what you expect from a market digesting gains in thin liquidity rather than reversing trend. Structurally, the recent breakout above the $1.34 zone has turned that region into the first meaningful support, while $1.35\u20131.36 has become the band where positioning and the Fed narrative will be stress-tested next.\nUSD Leg: DXY At 98.03, Rate-Cut Pricing And Fed Chair Uncertainty\nOn the USD side, the backdrop is clearly softer. The dollar index trades around 98.03, only +0.08% on the day, well below earlier 2025 peaks. Rates markets now price at least two Fed cuts in 2026, with cumulative easing around 50 bps, and some curves still assuming the first move could come as early as April 2026, while other projections push it to after June. This rate profile is anchored in softer U.S. data: labor-market cooling signals, slower wage dynamics and easing inflation. Even when headline releases like Q3 GDP surprised to the upside, they did not change the path; the market continues to trade a shift toward looser policy. The political layer strengthens that pressure. President Donald Trump is widely expected to name a successor to Jerome Powell, with Kevin Hassett treated as the leading candidate. Hassett is associated with a strong preference for lower borrowing costs. If he takes the chair, the market will assume a structurally more dovish Fed reaction function. That combination of priced-in cuts and leadership risk keeps the USD on the defensive and gives GBP/USD room to stay elevated near $1.35.\nGBP Leg: Illiquid Tape But A Less-Dovish Profile Than The Fed\nOn the GBP side, the short-term story is lack of domestic drivers. Holiday trading has drained liquidity, and the session you are working off explicitly notes an absence of major UK data releases. Many desks are under-staffed, and flows are light, so GBP is not trading off fresh UK macro surprises. Instead, Sterling is riding the rate-differential structure built earlier in December. The Bank of England has already cut, but the market interpreted it as a hawkish cut, with messaging that policy is easing from restrictive levels rather than pivoting into a deep dovish stance. That leaves the forward curve for UK rates looking less aggressive on easing than the Fed curve. The result is straightforward: relative rate expectations have shifted in favor of GBP, and as the USD loses altitude on 2026 cuts and chair risk, GBP/USD above 1.34 becomes a rational equilibrium, not a speculative overshoot.\nCross-Asset Context: S&P 500 At 6,926.62, Dow At 48,629.42, Nasdaq At 23,614.47\nThe equity backdrop confirms that this is not a panic-driven FX move. The S&P 500 closed around 6,926.62 (down 5.43 points, or -0.08%), the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 48,629.42 (down 101.74 points, or -0.21%), and the Nasdaq Composite ended essentially flat at 23,614.47 (up 1.17 points). Trading was shortened and volumes moderate. Investors are managing year-end positioning rather than reacting to a single macro shock. Strategists are already calling 2026 a \u201cprove-it year\u201d: corporates must show real productivity and margin gains from AI and capex rather than just narrative.

Rates markets now price at least two Fed cuts in 2026, with cumulative easing around 50 bps, and some curves still assuming the first move could come as early as April 2026, while other projections push it to after June. This rate profile is anchored in softer U.S. data: labor-market cooling signals, slower wage dynamics and easing inflation. Even when headline releases like Q3 GDP surprised to the upside, they did not change the path; the market continues to trade a shift toward looser policy. The political layer strengthens that pressure. President Donald Trump is widely expected to name a successor to Jerome Powell, with Kevin Hassett treated as the leading candidate. Hassett is associated with a strong preference for lower borrowing costs. If he takes the chair, the market will assume a structurally more dovish Fed reaction function. That combination of priced-in cuts and leadership risk keeps the USD on the defensive and gives GBP/USD room to stay elevated near $1.35.\nGBP Leg: Illiquid Tape But A Less-Dovish Profile Than The Fed\nOn the GBP side, the short-term story is lack of domestic drivers. Holiday trading has drained liquidity, and the session you are working off explicitly notes an absence of major UK data releases. Many desks are under-staffed, and flows are light, so GBP is not trading off fresh UK macro surprises. Instead, Sterling is riding the rate-differential structure built earlier in December. The Bank of England has already cut, but the market interpreted it as a hawkish cut, with messaging that policy is easing from restrictive levels rather than pivoting into a deep dovish stance. That leaves the forward curve for UK rates looking less aggressive on easing than the Fed curve. The result is straightforward: relative rate expectations have shifted in favor of GBP, and as the USD loses altitude on 2026 cuts and chair risk, GBP/USD above 1.34 becomes a rational equilibrium, not a speculative overshoot.\nCross-Asset Context: S&P 500 At 6,926.62, Dow At 48,629.42, Nasdaq At 23,614.47\nThe equity backdrop confirms that this is not a panic-driven FX move. The S&P 500 closed around 6,926.62 (down 5.43 points, or -0.08%), the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 48,629.42 (down 101.74 points, or -0.21%), and the Nasdaq Composite ended essentially flat at 23,614.47 (up 1.17 points). Trading was shortened and volumes moderate. Investors are managing year-end positioning rather than reacting to a single macro shock. Strategists are already calling 2026 a \u201cprove-it year\u201d: corporates must show real productivity and margin gains from AI and capex rather than just narrative.

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) has long been a staple of the global foreign exchange market, functioning as a high-beta proxy for global growth and commodity demand. Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez has released a comprehensive forecast focusing on the AUD\u2019s market share and strategic standing as we head into 2026. This research provides an objective analysis of how shifting trade alliances, domestic fiscal resilience, and the global energy transition are reshaping the demand for the \u201cAussie\u201d dollar. By synthesizing macroeconomic indicators, the study aims to offer a transparent outlook on the currency\u2019s ability to maintain its prominent position within the international monetary hierarchy.\nHernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez on Australia\u2019s Evolving Commodity Export Profile\nThe research team led by Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez identifies a significant shift in the underlying drivers of the Australian Dollar\u2019s value. Historically tied to iron ore and coal, the AUD\u2019s market share in 2026 will increasingly be supported by \u201cfuture-facing\u201d minerals such as lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. As the world accelerates its transition to green energy, Australia\u2019s role as a primary supplier of these critical components enhances the currency\u2019s structural demand. The study highlights that this diversification of the export base reduces the AUD\u2019s historical sensitivity to single-commodity price shocks, creating a more stable and resilient market share among institutional investors.\nThe Impact of Regional Trade Integration and Asia-Pacific Dynamics\nA significant portion of the Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez report is dedicated to Australia\u2019s strategic positioning within the Asia-Pacific region. As trade agreements like the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) mature, the AUD is increasingly utilized in intra-regional trade settlements. The research explores how the diversification of trade partners beyond traditional hubs provides a \u201cliquidity buffer\u201d for the currency. Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez provides a neutral assessment, noting that while geopolitical tensions remain a risk factor, Australia\u2019s strengthened economic ties with Southeast Asian nations are likely to bolster the AUD\u2019s market share as a preferred medium of exchange in the Pacific basin.\nMonetary Policy Divergence and the RBA Interest Rate Outlook\nAccording to findings from Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez, the relative stance of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) compared to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will be a decisive factor in 2026. The research examines the \u201cinterest rate differential\u201d and its effect on capital inflows. In an environment where global inflation may remain \u201csticky,\u201d the RBA\u2019s commitment to maintaining domestic price stability can attract yield-seeking investors. Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez notes that the AUD\u2019s market share often expands when Australia offers a premium over other G10 currencies, making it a critical asset for carry trade participants and global macro funds seeking to hedge against lower-yielding regions.\nThe Role of the Australian Dollar in Global Reserve Portfolios\nHernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez investigates the trend of central bank diversification and its impact on the AUD\u2019s standing as a reserve currency. While the US Dollar and Euro remain dominant, the Australian Dollar has seen a steady increase in its share of global allocated reserves. The study delves into the \u201csafe-haven plus\u201d narrative\u2014where the AUD offers the safety of a stable, democratic legal framework combined with higher growth potential than traditional European or Japanese assets. Hernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez\u2019s analysis suggests that as central banks seek to mitigate currency debasement risks, the AUD\u2019s market share in official reserves is projected to reach new highs by late 2026.\nHernan Eduardo Perez Gonzalez on Domestic Fiscal Health and Investment Inflows\nThe evolution of Australia\u2019s domestic economic landscape is another focal point"

                "body": "Toward the end of 2025, USD/JPY continues to show consistent bullish bias, remaining near the highs of the year. Part of this weakness in the Japanese yen can be explained by its low interest rate, one of the lowest among major central banks globally. However, recent economic dynamics suggest that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may begin adjusting its monetary policy stance, which could eventually support a more stable strengthening of the yen during 2026.\nWhat Could the BOJ\u2019s New Stance Look Like?\nCurrently, the BOJ\u2019s interest rate is significantly lower than that of other major central banks, making it difficult for the yen to regain ground against other currencies. Such low rates make Japanese fixed-income investments less attractive, which limits demand for yen.\nAt the time of writing, the BOJ plans to end 2025 with a rate of 0.75%, higher than the 0.5% maintained through most of the year, but still far below its peers: the United States (3.75%), Canada (2.25%), and the European Union (2.15%). In comparative terms, the yen remains one of the least competitive currencies for fixed-income investors.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nLooking ahead to 2026, the BOJ could enter the year as one of the few central banks expected to raise interest rates, moving from the stable 0.5% level to the new 0.75%. This shift is mainly due to one of the pillars of its monetary policy \u2014 inflation \u2014 no longer being temporary and beginning to show greater persistence.\nAfter reaching an annual low of 2.7% in August, inflation climbed to 3.0% in October, once again moving away from the 2% target. This demonstrates that inflationary pressures have become significant again and could become a serious issue if the BOJ decides to maintain excessively low rates in 2026.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nAdditionally, wage growth in Japan is at one of its highest levels in the past three decades. At the end of 2024, the average increase was 3.6%, and by the end of 2025 it is expected to exceed 4.0%. If this trend continues, it could drive greater domestic consumption, further pushing up prices and fueling inflationary pressures in 2026.\nAnother important factor is that the prolonged weakness of the yen has become both an economic and political issue. Officials within the government and the BOJ have noted that a weak yen raises the cost of imports, which eventually pushes up domestic prices. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently stated that, aside from pro-growth policies expected for 2026, yen weakness remains one of the main risks for the Japanese economy. This suggests that, along with potential government support measures for the currency, the BOJ may need to step away from its ultra-loose monetary stance and move toward policy normalization to strengthen the yen.\nConsidering all this, the 2026 outlook points to a yen that begins the year relatively weak but with increasing potential for recovery if the BOJ begins implementing rate hikes. As one of the only central banks likely to raise rates in 2026, Japan could see sustained improvements in yen demand, encouraging greater investor interest. This could produce a bearish bias in USD/JPY, especially if the Federal Reserve confirms that it will maintain neutral or even lower rates in 2026, making it more difficult for the dollar to hold its ground.\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY in 2026\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The Large Lateral Range Remains Intact: Since January 2024, USD/JPY has traded within a broad sideways range between the upper boundary at 160 yen per dollar and the lower boundary near 140 yen per dollar. Despite the dollar\u2019s recovery against the yen in 2025, the bullish momentum still appears insufficient to break out of this dominant range. Even when price attempted to approach levels not seen since June 2024, it quickly encountered renewed weakness, reinforcing the resilience of this lateral structure. If the neutrality observed in the last weeks of 2025 persists, the bullish bias that dominated much of the ye"

                "body": "USD/JPY Today, December 28: Yen Slips to Mid-156 as Intervention Watch\nUSD/JPY trades in the mid-156s today as yen intervention risk stays in focus and the Bank of Japan outlook skews cautious. With thin holiday liquidity and futures pointing to 2\u20133 Fed cuts in 2025, possibly starting in March, the pair reacts quickly to policy headlines. For Japan-based investors, the Japanese yen exchange rate is sensitive to official comments, liquidity windows, and data surprises. We outline today\u2019s drivers, what matters next, and practical steps to manage risk.\nUSD/JPY Today: Drivers in Tokyo\nAuthorities keep warning they will respond to excessive moves, so traders see elevated yen intervention risk. The line is not preannounced, which increases two-way volatility when USD/JPY accelerates. Tokyo dealers report quick bursts around headlines and fixes as orders cluster. Recent overseas moves also showed softer yen as dollar demand firmed source.\nYear-end conditions reduce depth, widen spreads, and exaggerate small order flows. In Tokyo, flows around the 9:55 JST fix can create sharp, short-lived swings in USD/JPY. Later, overlaps with London often reset direction. Thin books also mean stops get triggered faster. For intraday traders, limit orders, pre-set exits, and smaller sizes can help contain slippage during the holiday period.\nBank of Japan Outlook and the Yen\nMarkets see fewer near-term hikes as inflation momentum looks mixed, which narrows support for the yen. That shift cooled demand after earlier speculation of faster normalization. Local media also note a retreat in early-hike expectations, adding pressure on the Japanese yen exchange rate source.\nWe will watch wage trends, services inflation, and the BoJ Summary of Opinions for clues on timing. Hints on reducing balance sheet support or allowing higher yields could aid the yen. Clearer guidance would anchor expectations. Absent that, USD/JPY will take its cue from official remarks and how money markets price the path of policy into spring.\nFed Expectations and USD Support\nCurrent pricing suggests 2\u20133 Fed cuts in 2025, with a possible first move in March. If incoming data argue for patience, the dollar may find support, keeping USD/JPY elevated. If data soften, faster cuts could weigh on the dollar. The balance of risks today keeps the pair headline-sensitive, especially in thin liquidity.\nKey reports that often sway the dollar include jobs, CPI, PCE inflation, and ISM surveys. Surprises shift rate expectations and treasury yields, which feed into FX. Strong readings can lift the dollar and support USD/JPY. Softer prints do the opposite. With fewer releases this week, even second-tier data or Fed remarks could move prices.\nTrading Playbook for Japan-Based Investors\nDefine risk before entry. Use smaller positions and clear stop-loss levels when liquidity is thin. Consider time-based exits around known event windows. For households with overseas expenses, simple forward contracts can stabilize budgets. Corporates can layer hedges by tenor to smooth rates. Focus on process, not prediction, when yen intervention risk is elevated.\nRound numbers attract orders, but gaps can occur. Plan around Tokyo fix, London open, and early New York, when flows shift. Use limit and stop orders rather than market orders during fast moves. If you scale into USD/JPY, keep intervals small and review fills. Avoid chasing breakouts without a predefined invalidation.\nFinal Thoughts\nUSD/JPY sitting in the mid-156s on December 28 reflects three forces today: ongoing intervention watch, a softer near-term Bank of Japan outlook, and a dollar supported by cautious Fed-cut pricing. With holiday liquidity thin, price can overshoot on modest news. We suggest keeping positions light, using limit orders, and predefining exits around Tokyo and London flow windows. Watch official comments, BoJ communications, and any U.S. data that shifts March cut odds. For households and corporates, a layered hedging plan can reduce n"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Outlook: Late-Stage Dollar Strength Versus a Delayed Yen Comeback\nUSD/JPY Trading Zone And Market Context In Late 2025\nUSD/JPY is trading in the mid-156s, around 156.5\u2013156.6, after touching a recent peak near 157.77 and spending much of Q4 in the upper half of a very wide 140\u2013160 range. Daily candles look controlled, but structurally this is late-cycle territory after a multi-year yen selloff. The pair is held up by the still-wide rate gap between the U.S. and Japan and by thin year-end liquidity, but every additional tick higher runs into a heavier wall of intervention risk, valuation concerns and crowded positioning. At these levels, the market is effectively pricing in that Japan stays behind the curve while the Federal Reserve stays tighter for longer, even as incoming data start to push the narrative in the opposite direction.\nUSD/JPY Macro Spread: Fed Easing Path Versus BoJ Normalization\nThe core driver of USD/JPY has been the interest-rate spread, and that spread is no longer widening. Japan finishes 2025 with the BoJ policy rate around 0.75%, up from 0.5% for most of the year, while the U.S. sits near 3.75%. Futures price roughly two to three 25 bp Fed cuts across 2025 and additional easing into 2026, while markets expect the BoJ to lift rates by another 25 bp next year from today\u2019s level. The result is a gradual compression in nominal and real yield differentials. The dollar is no longer gaining new carry advantage versus the yen; it is living off the momentum of the last two years. Once investors fully internalize that the U.S. moves toward smaller rates and Japan moves in the opposite direction, a 156\u2013158 handle on USD/JPY becomes harder to justify except on short bursts of risk-on or intervention-free periods.\nBoJ Inflation, Wages And Fiscal Policy: Foundations For A Stronger Yen\nOn the Japan side, the macro story has quietly shifted from deflation risk to inflation management. Tokyo core CPI has eased from 2.7% year-on-year to around 2.0%, helped by softer food prices, but it still sits at or above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. Wage growth has broken out of the old stagnation regime: average pay increases were about 3.6% at the end of 2024 and are expected to exceed 4.0% by the end of 2025, one of the strongest readings in three decades. Rising wages combined with inflation anchored near or slightly above 2% is the exact configuration the BoJ said it needed to move away from ultra-loose policy. Add to that a record fiscal budget for the next fiscal year, with high spending but a plan to curb new bond issuance, and you have a set-up where keeping policy too loose risks embedding higher inflation. For USD/JPY, that macro mix pushes BoJ risk skewed toward more tightening, not less, over a 2026 horizon.\nBoJ Communication And JGB Yields: From Anchor Of Weakness To Support For The Yen\nBoJ officials have moved from calling inflation \u201ctransitory\u201d to admitting that underlying inflation is steadily approaching the 2% target. Public comments now explicitly accept that further hikes are possible if wage-price dynamics stay firm. The bond market has reacted accordingly: the 10-year JGB yield has printed above 2.07%, a high not seen in roughly twenty-six years, before slipping slightly back toward 2.04%. That is not a cosmetic move. When the long end of the Japanese curve moves from near-zero to around 2%, the yen ceases to be a pure zero-yield funding currency. Owners of Japanese assets are finally paid something to stay in yen instead of mechanically reaching for higher U.S. yields. For USD/JPY, higher JGB yields narrow the carry argument and reduce the incentive to push the cross into new highs without a fresh macro catalyst.\nDollar Side: DXY Slippage, Fed Liquidity And Political Risk Under The Surface\nThe broader dollar backdrop has turned from persistent strength into a choppy drift lower. The Dollar Index is around 98.0\u201398.1, up only 0.01\u20130.08% on the day in recent trading, but down roughly 0.6% on the week, even aft"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF \u201crecord outflows\u201d are deceptive as crypto products absorbed $46.7 billion in 2025\nWithout aggregation, cohort analysis, and scaling, single-day flow stories are just noise.\nBitcoin ETF headlines have turned into a scoreboard with \u201crecord inflows,\u201d \u201clargest outflows ever,\u201d and \u201cinstitutions dumping.\u201d The problem is that most stories isolate a single day or a single fund.\nWithout context on cumulative flows, fund cohorts, and custody plumbing, they say very little about how much spot Bitcoin is actually changing hands, or what institutions are really doing.\nTake the latest wobble. U.S.-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $175 million in net outflows on Dec. 24, capping five straight negative sessions.\nIt looks grim, but zooming out shows that the complex still holds roughly $113.8 billion in assets and has cumulative net inflows of nearly $56.9 billion since January 2024. A red headline about \u201cinvestors heading for the exits\u201d describes a move of around 0.1% of outstanding ETF assets.\nData from Farside Investors shows that, as of late December, BlackRock's IBIT alone had taken in more than $62 billion since launch, with the US spot ETF cohort collectively offsetting roughly $25 billion in GBTC outflows.\nThat means a cluster of record daily redemptions has so far dented, but not reversed, a structurally positive flow picture.\nThe same \u201czoom out\u201d rule applies globally. CoinShares reported that crypto ETFs and ETPs worldwide took in a record $5.95 billion in a single week in early October, with Bitcoin products alone accounting for $3.55 billion.\nMonthly reviews show October's net crypto ETP inflows reached $7.6 billion.\nA trader who only saw a negative flow headline in November, when digital asset products logged a $1.94 billion weekly outflow, would miss that it came after a long run-up and represented under 3% of total ETP assets.\nIt also matters which funds the flows are in. When IBIT suffered a record daily outflow in November, other US spot funds had already seen hundreds of millions in redemptions, while some newer, cheaper products continued to attract assets.\nThe first year of the US spot cohort notes this rotation effect: roughly $36 billion of net inflows across US spot Bitcoin ETFs after one year, even as GBTC alone lost over $21 billion to rivals.\nDay-to-day, those cross-currents can produce headlines about \u201crecord outflows\u201d from a single ticker when the complex is roughly flat, or positive over a larger period.\nAggregation matters to avoid noise\nCustody and plumbing add another layer of confusion.\nInflows and outflows measure money entering or leaving a fund, not the performance of the underlying asset. Flows often reflect investors migrating between products based on fees, tax considerations, and brand, rather than a wholesale change in Bitcoin conviction.\nNot every ETF dollar creates an immediate spot purchase. Some issuers hedge with futures or use internal market-making inventory, so the simple \u201c$X in inflows equals $X of extra buy pressure\u201d model breaks down.\nFor readers trying to make sense of the tape, a repeatable framework starts with aggregation.\nAny headline about a single day should be checked against rolling weekly or monthly flows and cumulative net flows since launch.\nSecond, flows should be viewed at the cohort level to see whether assets are leaving the ecosystem or simply moving to a cheaper product. Third, flows should be scaled by total ETF AUM, Bitcoin's market cap, and daily trading volume.\nOn most days, even \u201crecord\u201d ETF redemptions are small next to the trillions in annual Bitcoin turnover.\nFinally, flow data must be married with market structure. Price can fall on big inflows if they reflect hedged creations or a short basis trade. It can rise on outflows if those redemptions are driven by profit-taking into a tight market with limited sell-side supply.\nWeekly reports showing Bitcoin ETFs bleeding while altcoin ETPs attract capital highlight that flows are often about intra-crypto ro"

In a Monday X post, David Sacks said the US was at a critical juncture for crypto regulation, and that Selig and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins made up a dream team to define clear regulatory guidelines. Sacks comments were in response to Selig saying that the US Congress was preparing to complete work on a crypto market structure bill. We are at a unique moment as a wide range of novel technologies, products, and platforms are emerging, retail participation in the commodity markets is at an all-time high, and Congress is poised to send digital asset market structure legislation that will cement the US as the Crypto Capital of the World to the presidents desk, said Selig on X.\nCoinbase CEO says reopening GENIUS Act is red line, slams bank lobbying\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said any attempt to reopen the GENIUS Act would cross a red line, accusing banks of using political pressure to block competition from stablecoins and fintech platforms.\nIn a Sunday post on X, Armstrong said he was impressed banks could lobby Congress so openly without backlash, adding that Coinbase would continue pushing back on efforts to revise the law. We wont let anyone reopen GENIUS, he wrote.\nMy prediction is the banks will actually flip and be lobbying FOR the ability to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in a few years, once they realize how big the opportunity is for them. So its 100% wasted effort on their part (in addition to being unethical), Armstrong added.\nThe GENIUS Act, passed after months of negotiations, bars stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly but allows platforms and third parties to offer rewards.\nBitcoin never crossed $100K if adjusted for inflation, says Alex Thorn\nBitcoin came just shy of hitting a milestone six figures when inflation is factored in, despite the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time peak of above $126,000 in October, says Galaxy head of research Alex Thorn.\nIf you adjust the price of Bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100,000, Thorn said on Tuesday. It actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms, if you can believe it.\nThorn said his adjusted price high for Bitcoin accounted for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decline in purchasing power incrementally across every inflation print from 2020 to today.\nCPI measures inflation via the prices of a basket of goods and services and is calculated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to track changes in spending habits.\nExtended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode\nBitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode.\nSince early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday.\nThis persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market, it added.\nFlows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October.\nThe ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted.\nBrazil\u2019s live orchestra to turn Bitcoin price moves into music\nAn experimental orchestral project in Brazil aims to convert Bitcoin price data into live music, after receiving approval to ra"

It is essential to run fair and reasonable upside models, and this explains why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily making such headway as an Ethereum-focused DeFi cryptocurrency that traders can invest in. At the current presale price of $0.035, it would be possible to accumulate around 28,571 units of the MUTM cryptocurrency with a mere $1,000,\nIf the anticipated $1 price milestone is reached in 2026, this translates to nearly 29x returns, an upside that is simply unimaginable in large-cap markets. This euphoria is being precipitated by an excellent presale that has seen the project now in its 6th stage and 99% sold out, establishing immense urgency in terms of traders seeking to acquire this particular cryptocurrency prior to the next price hurdle. Apart from the upside potential, the winning formula in MUTM lies in the real-world utility that it derives as an Ethereum-focused decentralized lending and borrowing system, meaning that there exists intrinsic usage, rather than an asset simply based on speculation.\nPhase 6 Almost Full, Secure MUTM Before Price Increase\nMutuum Finance started its presale in early 2025 at a token price of $0.01, but currently, the token is at a value of $0.035, resulting in a 250% growth in its value with no exchange listing yet. This indicates a significant interest in the market as well as utility in the token, MUTM.\nPhase 6 has surpassed the 95% mark in sales, leaving very few tokens left at this current price point. Investors wanting a piece of the action before the launch price of $0.06 are taking immediate action. To incentivize people even further to take an active part in this project, Mutuum Finance introduced a new leaderboard that changes every 24 hours and awards the person who made the most significant investment with $500 of MUTM tokens.\nKey Milestones\nMutuum Finance is on the threshold of a major development phase with V1 launch on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025, including:\n- Lending & borrowing infrastructure\n- mtTokens\n- Debt token system\n- Liquidation bot\nAt first, the tokens that will be supported include ETH and USDT. Most of the tokens that are in the initial stage of development are released without the product working. However, Mutuum Finance has developed their product completely before launch. It is among the next-big-cryptos that can be invested in.\nCurrently, the project is at Phase 2 of the development cycle, working on smart contract optimizations and being prepared for multi-stage testing. As the team prepares for Version 1 and security audits continue, the pace of progress continues to be swift and very promising.\nUrgency Peaks as Phase 6 Closes\nWith over 99% allocated for Phase 6, the tokens at $0.035 are dwindling quickly. The weekly jumps in membership are fueling the need for new entrants to secure their tokens before Phase 7. Whale activity has also escalated, with an acceleration of allocations and a message being sent to small investors that it is time to take action. As soon as Phase 6 closes, the presale enters a stage closer to the launch valuation level.\nFor investors looking for the most suitable cryptocurrency to purchase before the end of 2026, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the most promising Ethereum-based DeFi project that offers huge potential. At the current presale price of $0.035, an initial investment of $1,000 will yield 28,571 units of the MUTM cryptocurrency. Then, if the cryptocurrency attains a value of $1 by the end of 2026, the initial investment could balloon to nearly $29,000. Given that Phase 6 is over 99% sold out and that the V1 Testnet is about to be launched, investors who purchase the cryptocurrency early will stand to gain from utilizing the services provided by the cryptocurrency and the presale\u2019s growth structure. In fact, the time frame for buying the cryptocurrency at a discount will soon be closing as Phas"

                "body": "In the tumultuous arena of cryptocurrency, the showdown between Solana and Ethereum has ignited intense debate and investment fervor. This rivalry transcends mere market fluctuations; it\u2019s a vivid reflection of contrasting ideologies regarding blockchain technology and its myriad applications.\nThe Landscape of Blockchain Competition\nAs the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, the rivalry between Solana and Ethereum intensifies. Charles Hoskinson, a prominent voice in the crypto space and the architect behind Cardano, offers a revealing commentary on their stark differences. Ethereum, the stalwart foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi), is gradually transitioning toward scalability in the long run. In stark contrast, Solana bursts onto the scene with its dizzying transaction speeds and formidable capacity, increasingly appealing to those seeking immediate functionalities and seamless asset tokenization. These divergent trajectories highlight not just competition but a pivot in the development of blockchain technology itself.\nSolana\u2019s Speed: An Edge in Growth\nAt the core of Solana's explosive rise is its ability to process transactions at remarkable speeds. Developers aiming to integrate cryptocurrencies with the traditional financial system find Solana's streamlined architecture incredibly appealing. Recent figures reveal that Solana has enabled the tokenization of assets worth a staggering 185 million USD, underscoring its capacity to handle high levels of on-chain engagement. This kind of efficiency positions Solana as a beacon for Web3 startups eager to harness the power of real-time transactions. With the increasing demand for tokenized assets, Solana\u2019s performance not only enriches user experience but also solidifies its status as a leader in merging crypto and fiat.\nEthereum: A Methodical Framework\nOn the flip side, Ethereum builds its strengths through a carefully curated, research-driven approach. This thoughtful evolution, particularly evident in its pivot to proof-of-stake, underscores its commitment to future-proofing the platform. However, such a meticulous strategy can result in Ethereum lagging in a fast-moving market ripe with immediate opportunities. While Ethereum hosts significant stablecoin activities, marked by deep liquidity and robust economic interactions, its slower pace of adaptation could limit its competitiveness as traders flock to platforms offering swifter execution.\nDistinct Philosophical Pathways\nHoskinson points out that Solana and Ethereum are steering their ships guided by contrasting operational philosophies. Solana\u2019s architecture is designed for rapid updates and nimble governance, equipping it with the tools necessary to react swiftly to the market's pulse. This agility has garnered considerable investor attention, yet it brings with it a potential volatility that cautious investors must navigate. Ethereum, in contrast, embodies a more methodical pace that fosters a sense of trustworthiness for its long-term stakeholders.\nFurthermore, the ethical dimensions of decentralized governance shape each platform's narrative. Solana\u2019s quick decision-making process allows it to pivot smoothly in response to market shifts, whereas Ethereum\u2019s slower, more deliberate strategy breeds confidence and stability\u2014qualities that resonate with investors looking for sustainable growth amidst market chaos.\nThe Importance of Tokenized Assets\nWith the surge of tokenized assets becoming increasingly prominent, the unique capabilities of Solana and Ethereum emerge vividly. Solana excels in managing large transaction volumes, particularly in tokenization efforts, while Ethereum showcases a diverse array of DeFi applications. As demand for these digital assets skyrockets, the differentiation between their strategies becomes sharper. For enterprises entrenched in asset tokenization, Solana offers an impressive framework defined by significant capacity and efficiency.\nEmbr"

European exporters are particularly upset, with an EU spokesperson warning \"this decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nDomestically, the reaction is mixed. US steel companies like Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) are trading higher, with shares up about 12% each in the premarket. The broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), however, is trading down 0.3% premarket.\nMeanwhile, trade negotiations with China are on the rocks once again. Last week President Trump accused China of reneging on unspecified trade commitments, prompting the Chinese to level similar accusations against the U.S. A call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected to take place later this week, could either help or hurt\nFor now, the situation just remains unsettled.\nEarnings\nThe Campbell's Company (Nasdaq: CPB) reported an earnings beat this morning, and guided higher for the rest of 2025, sending the stock up modestly premarket.\nAdvertisement\nScience Applications International (Nasdaq: SAIC) reported mixed earnings, with sales on target but profits less than expected. SAIC stock is down more than 6% premarket.\nAnalyst Calls\nDow Jones Industrial Average component company Boeing (NYSE: BA) won an upgrade to buy from Bank of America this morning. Setting a price target of $260 a share, BofA analyst Ronald Epstein observed that President Trump is using Boeing as a tool in trade negotiations, accepting orders for Boeing planes (which helps the U.S. balance of trade) in exchange for U.S. tariffs concessions. The analyst cited \"recent deals struck in the UK (32 aircraft orders), Qatar (210 aircraft orders), UAE (28 aircraft orders), and China (removing the ban on BA aircraft), as setting a precedent for future global trade negotiations, to BA's benefit.\"\nAt least one of those deals now looks at risk, however.\nRetirement planning doesn\u2019t have to feel overwhelming.

Leading the pack are Tesla, Nvidia, Google, and Apple, standing just above key buy points and promising lucrative opportunities for savvy investors. Nvidia steals the spotlight as an AI investment standout, making waves with its robust market performance.\nIntroduction to Stock Market Trends of 2025\nThe stock market in 2025 is witnessing remarkable trends as we approach the year-end, with major indices like the Dow Jones futures setting new records. As noted in Investor's Business Daily, giant stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, Google, and Apple are poised at attractive buy points, driving significant investor interest. This landscape signifies a potential opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on these strategic positions of influential tech companies. Key narratives suggest that the enthusiasm surrounding these stocks is driven by both their robust performance metrics and their pivotal role in technological advancements such as AI. Market participants are keenly watching these developments, assessing the likelihood of sustained momentum and evaluating emerging market opportunities as we head into 2026.\nKey Stocks: Tesla, Nvidia, Google, and Apple Overview\nAs 2025 draws to a close, the stock market is riding high, with Tesla, Nvidia, Google, and Apple capturing investors' attention. These titans of industry are positioned just above critical buy areas, presenting intriguing opportunities for traders. According to Investor's Business Daily, the current market landscape is buoyed by a robust economic backdrop, with recent rallying points suggesting an optimistic outlook as we move into 2026.\nTesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) are spearheading the charge, not only in terms of buy points but also in their roles as leaders in electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, respectively. Nvidia, in particular, is highlighted as a strategic investment amidst the AI boom, with its stock showing resilience during the holiday trading week. The company's growth trajectory reinforces its status as a vital player in the technology sector, solidifying its long-term value as noted by analysts.\nAlong with Tesla and Nvidia, powerhouses like Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) contribute significantly to the market's current dynamics. Positioned at the cusp of new buying opportunities, these stocks benefit from their strong performance records. Apple's steadfast presence in the tech market, coupled with Google's dominance in digital services, makes them attractive options for cautious investors seeking stability at record market highs.\nDespite the overall bullish sentiment, there is a prevailing awareness of the inherent risks. Market analysts express caution over potential volatility, especially with stocks approaching high valuation territories. Nvidia's high P/E ratio, anticipated as part of its growth pricing amidst the AI demand, serves as a point of discussion. Nevertheless, as detailed by market followers, the innovative strength and market placement of companies like Tesla and Nvidia continue to support their upward momentum in the investor community.\nMarket Performance During Holiday Trading Week\nThe stock market typically exhibits unique trading patterns during the holiday week, characterized by lighter trading volumes and a tendency for minor yet notable market movements. As the year-end approaches, investors closely monitor indices like the Dow Jones, which are often at heightened levels during this period. The positive sentiment is fueled by various factors, such as strong corporate earnings and expectations of a 'Santa Claus rally,' a seasonal phenomenon where the stock market tends to perform well in the last week of December through the first two trading days of January.\nLeading stocks such as Tesla and Nvidia hav"

                "body": "Is 2026 the time for UK challenger banks to list on the London Stock Exchange? Yes, really!\nI want to defend the idea of shiny fintechs listing in the UK and not the US.\nUs dour Brits have made a national hobby of saying the grass is greener on the other side. Nowhere is this more so than when it comes to our stock markets.\nThere has been a good reason for this. In 2025, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) was 13th globally in terms of IPO (initial public offering) capital raised with a mere 3.5 per cent of what the US exchanges raised, whereas over the past decade that figure would have been 10 per cent. The past 12 months have also been another year of record outflows by UK investors from domestic stocks.\nThere are reasons to expect more American exceptionalism.\nUS capital markets are showing animal spirits with strong M&A activity and fundraising in the private markets. The new year could see mega-cap IPOs from companies including SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic.\nBut the US stock market is increasingly driven by retail investors, who like cult stocks and famous, larger-than-life founders. Retail investors make up about 20 per cent of US stock trading volumes, double what they were in 2010. This is also materially higher than institutional stock pickers, once you exclude computer-driven quant investing.\nA UK-based company with a mid single-digit, billion-dollar valuation, limited US brand awareness, decent but not explosive growth and lacking an AI angle is likely to be an orphan after listing in the US. Its size and domicile are likely to prevent it from getting into the important indices to attract passive money.\nThe mid-cap UK companies that have listed in the US in recent years and did not have the scale of, say, Arm, the Cambridge chip designer, have struggled with investor interest and valuations; Paysafe and Soho House are among their number.\nMoreover, most US companies that listed this year have struggled in the aftermarket. In fintech, Klarna and Chime, both of which have market capitalisations of about $10 billion, have fallen 25 per cent and 10 per cent respectively from their IPO price.\nThere are five reasons why 2026 may be the year of fintech IPOs on the LSE: the UK loves bank stocks; macro tailwinds are good; they have government backing; sound business models; and talented management teams.\n\u2022 Is London poised for an IPO revival in 2026?\nLet\u2019s start with bank stocks. The FTSE 100 is up 18 per cent this year and even more in US dollar terms (important for the large number of international investors). But just as the US markets are dependent on a few large tech stocks, the FTSE 100 has been led partly by a small number of bank stocks. The average share price increase of the big UK banks is 60 per cent this year, and the stocks have trebled over the past five years.\nThe long-term track record is very different. But the UK stock market is familiar with bank stocks and rewards them when they demonstrate growth and profitability. The recent IPO of mid-cap lender Shawbrook got away without a hitch. The shares are up 18 per cent since the listing, with a market capitalisation of \u00a32.4 billion.\nConnected to this is a second important factor: macro tailwinds. The Bank of England is signalling that after this month\u2019s interest rate reduction, the likely number of cuts will be limited. Higher interest rates will benefit the \u201cneobanks\u201d \u2014 the likes of Monzo and Starling \u2014 that park most of their money with the Bank of England or in gilts.\nThird, government backing. The chancellor recently announced a three-year stamp duty exemption on shares traded in newly listed companies. Given the chaos of the autumn budget, the Labour government is looking for good news stories. IPOs of Monzo and Starling on the LSE would do just that, especially if combined with splashy headlines on new jobs being created or money being invested in the UK.\nFourth, company business models. Revolut is a truly global player with a CEO at least partly based in Dub"

                "body": "December 27: Epstein Files Delay Triggers Bipartisan Heat on DOJ\nThe Epstein files release faces a fresh delay after the DOJ missed a mandated deadline and said it discovered over a million more documents. That admission triggered bipartisan scrutiny, audit calls, and talk of subpoenas. The White House\u2019s shifting messaging adds noise. For German investors, Washington risk into January can move global risk appetite, drive safe-haven flows, and sway the DAX and euro. We outline what changed, why the DOJ delay matters, and how to manage headline risk tied to the Epstein files release.\nWhat changed with the DOJ timeline\nThe DOJ missed the court-ordered timeline and reported over a million additional records linked to the case, widening the scope and workload. Officials now signal more time is needed, saying the review could take a few more weeks source. For investors, the extended window means more headline risk around the Epstein files release and slower clarity on what will be public.\nA longer review raises the odds of heavier redactions, staged disclosures, and fresh litigation, which could keep attention high. That cadence matters: each batch can revive coverage, spark new angles, and extend uncertainty. Markets prefer closure. The drawn-out path for the Epstein files release keeps risk premia sticky into January and can lift volatility around political soundbites.\nPolitical heat and oversight signals\nMembers from both parties now press for audits, timelines, and, if needed, subpoenas. Bipartisan scrutiny raises the cost of delay and makes sudden disclosure more likely. Fast shifts in scope, including queries around Trump Epstein flights logs, can prompt sharp intraday swings as new names or details surface during the Epstein files release cycle.\nAllies have aired frustration with shifting talking points, which keeps the story alive and invites more questions source. Messaging gaps often extend the news cycle. For markets, that means a tighter link between political coverage and intraday sentiment, with the DOJ delay sustaining focus on the Epstein files release.\nWhen oversight intensifies, agencies front-load process updates, while lawmakers float deadlines. That drumbeat can weigh on cyclicals and support defensives. The persistence of the Epstein files release narrative increases the Washington risk premium, keeping a bid in volatility and nudging investors to price a wider range of political outcomes.\nWhy German investors should watch this\nU.S. political stress can dampen global risk. For Germany, that can pressure the DAX via exporters tied to U.S. demand, while boosting demand for safer assets. The euro may see two-way moves as traders balance U.S. event risk against ECB expectations. The Epstein files release adds headline catalysts across January sessions.\nDefensives like staples and utilities often hold up better during political noise, while media and social platforms are more headline-sensitive. FX traders may fade abrupt spikes, then reassess on new facts. Watch cross-asset links: higher volatility can tighten financial conditions. The DOJ delay keeps these Epstein files release triggers in play.\nWe prefer simple rules: trim event-date leverage, set tight news alerts, and size positions for overnight gaps. Use options for defined risk, not short gamma into news bursts. Track committee calendars tied to oversight. The Epstein files release calendar and any subpoenas could bunch headlines, so keep cash buffers and review stop-losses.\nFinal Thoughts\nKey takeaways for German investors: the DOJ delay, the million-plus new records, and bipartisan scrutiny mean the Epstein files release will stay in focus into January. That sustains a Washington risk premium, with periodic spikes on committee moves, redaction debates, or references to Trump Epstein flights. We suggest a simple framework: reduce leverage around expected releases, favor liquid instruments, and use options to cap downside. Watch cross-asset signals as volati"

                "body": "NEW YORK, Dec. 27, 2025, 8:30 a.m. ET \u2014 Market closed\nFrankfurt is taking a breather\u2014but the story around the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) is anything but sleepy. With German cash equities shut for the Christmas stretch and the weekend, investors are heading into the next session with a familiar year-end mix: thin liquidity, big macro narratives, and a DAX that\u2019s been hovering in striking distance of record territory.\nAs of the latest global market snapshot, the DAX was around 24,340\u2014still perched near the top of its 2025 range. [1] And while the Frankfurt trading floor is quiet right now, global markets haven\u2019t exactly been whispering: U.S. stocks have been flirting with all-time highs in light holiday trade, and precious metals have been ripping higher into year-end. [2]\nHere\u2019s what matters for anyone planning their next Frankfurt move\u2014whether you trade the DAX directly, use Xetra-listed ETFs, or track Germany as a bellwether for broader European risk appetite.\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange status and the next session investors should plan for\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange\u2019s main venues\u2014Xetra and B\u00f6rse Frankfurt\u2014operate Monday through Friday. On standard trading days, Xetra runs 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CET (roughly 3:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. ET), while B\u00f6rse Frankfurt generally trades longer hours (typically 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. CET for many products). [3]\nHoliday calendars matter a lot right now because they change the rhythm of price discovery. Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s own calendar shows Germany\u2019s exchange closures around year-end, including the Christmas holiday block and New Year\u2019s shutdown. [4]\nTwo dates are especially important for the upcoming week:\n- Germany had no stock exchange trading during the Christmas holidays (Dec. 24 to Dec. 26). [5]\n- Trading is scheduled to end early on Tuesday, Dec. 30\u2014closing at 2:00 p.m. in Frankfurt and on Xetra, according to Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s weekly outlook. [6]\nThat sets up a very \u201ccompressed\u201d market environment: fewer real sessions, less liquidity, and more potential for gap moves when markets reopen and the first large institutional orders hit the tape.\nWhere the DAX stands heading into the reopen\nThe DAX\u2019s headline level has stayed elevated into late December, with Reuters\u2019 global market data showing it around 24,340. [7]\nZoom out slightly, and the bigger message is performance: Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s own year-end commentary notes the DAX is up more than 20% this year\u2014even without a classic year-end melt-up. [8] In the same outlook, chart technician Christoph Geyer argued that the remaining trading days may be too few to \u201cgenerate an upward breakout,\u201d even while acknowledging the year\u2019s gains have been \u201cquite impressive.\u201d [9]\nWhy that matters: a market that\u2019s already had a strong year doesn\u2019t need much of a catalyst to stall\u2014and in thin liquidity, \u201cstalling\u201d can look like sudden air pockets.\nThe Europe backdrop: rates, fiscal expectations, and a rotation narrative\nThe most recent broad read on European equities into the holiday period was straightforward: Europe has been strong, but trading has been thin.\nReuters reported European shares ending the holiday-shortened week near record highs and on track for their strongest annual performance since 2021, supported by easing interest rates, Germany\u2019s fiscal spending push, and investor diversification away from richly valued U.S. tech. [10]\nThat same Reuters update also highlighted something practical for Frankfurt watchers: Germany\u2019s market was shut for the holiday session\u2014meaning price discovery didn\u2019t happen in German cash stocks even as global macro forces (rates, metals, U.S. growth expectations) kept moving. [11]\nIn other words, part of the \u201cnews\u201d for Frankfurt is that Frankfurt hasn\u2019t been able to react in real time\u2014so the reopen can compress multiple days of global information into a single burst of repricing.\nGlobal cues from the last 24\u201348 hours: U.S. near highs, metals on fire\nEven though Frankfurt is closed today, investors are not flying blin"

                "body": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar fiscal fourth-quarter results earlier this month, with record revenue, beating analyst estimates. AI-driven growth powered the performance, yet the stock tumbled sharply afterward, dropping as much as 21% from $405 per share before the report to $321 per share in the following days.\nWhile Broadcom shares have since recovered some ground, they remain approximately 15% below their pre-earnings levels. This selloff is the result of a disconnect between strong fundamentals and the market\u2019s reaction.\nThere are three key reasons behind the decline in Broadcom stock, but these concerns open up an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price.\nBroadcom Shows Exceptional Strength\nBroadcom reported net revenue of $18 billion for the period, a 28% increase from $14 billion a year earlier. Semiconductor solutions revenue reached $11.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, while infrastructure software contributed $6.9 billion, up 19%. AI semiconductor revenue was exceptionally strong, rising 74% year-over-year to $6.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.95 per share, up 37% from the year-ago quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $12.1 billion, for margins of 68%, which was also 34% higher than last year, allowing Broadcom to generate a 36% increase in free cash flow to $7.5 billion.\nCEO Hock Tan highlighted the momentum, noting AI revenue growth drove the results. Broadcom also offered robust guidance for Q1, projecting revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year, with AI semiconductor revenue expected to double to $8.2 billion. Semiconductor revenue is forecast at about $12.3 billion, up 50%, underscoring continued demand acceleration.\nReason 1 For the Selloff: AI Backlog\nWhile AI-related order backlog of over $73 billion \u2014 deliverable over 18 months \u2014 was substantial, representing nearly half of the consolidated $162 billion backlog, was lower than anticipated for the pace of AI demand. This backlog includes custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking components like the Tomahawk 6 switch, with over $10 billion in orders for the latter alone. Management described bookings as \u201cunprecedented\u201d in recent months, but the specific backlog number contributed to perceptions of moderating momentum.\nReason 2: Expected Margin Pressure\nWhere gross margins were 77.9%, management said it expected a sequential decline of about 100 basis points in Q1 due to a higher mix of AI revenue, including passthrough costs in rack-level solutions. AI semiconductors, particularly custom chips and systems, carry lower margins than traditional products. Semiconductor gross margins are around 68%, compared to 93% for infrastructure software. As AI becomes a larger portion of revenue, this mix shift is expected to dilute overall margins slightly, even as absolute operating profit dollars grow.\nReason 3: Slowing Growth in Infrastructure Software\nA third concern was the outlook for infrastructure software, primarily from VMware. Although segment revenue grew 19%, guidance called for low double-digit growth next year, with Q1 at $6.8 billion, only 2% higher year-over-year. This deceleration from prior rates raised questions about sustained momentum in the software segment, which has offered high-margin stability.\nWhy This Is a Buying Opportunity\nDespite the stock\u2019s tumble, Broadcom\u2019s outlook remains robust, driven by accelerating AI demand that management describes as a multiyear trend. AI revenue is on track to double in Q1, fueled by custom accelerators and Ethernet networking.\nThe company has also diversified its customer base, adding a fifth XPU client with a $1 billion initial order for delivery in late 2026, alongside follow-on commitments worth $11 billion from existing hyperscalers. Networking backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion, reflecting strong deployment needs.\nMoreover, bookings have surged recently, with visibility into leading-edge nodes and advanced packaging secured through facility expansions.

                "source": "simplywall.st",
                "url": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-rave/rave-restaurant-group/news/is-rave-restaurant-group-incs-nasdaqrave-recent-stock-perfor/amp",
                "body": "Rave Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:RAVE) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Rave Restaurant Group's ROE today.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Rave Restaurant Group is:\n19% = US$2.8m \u00f7 US$15m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nRave Restaurant Group's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\nAt first glance, Rave Restaurant Group seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. This certainly adds some context to Rave Restaurant Group's moderate 20% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Rave Restaurant Group's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 30% in the same period.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Rave Restaurant Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\nIs Rave Restaurant Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\nRave Restaurant Group doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\nConclusion\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Rave Restaurant Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Let's not forget, business risk is also one of the factors that affects the price of the stock. So this is also an important area that investors need to pay attention to before making a decision on any business.

                "body": "U.S. stocks headed into the final stretch of 2025 clinging to record territory\u2014an unusually calm setup for a week that\u2019s famous for thin trading, year-end portfolio adjustments, and a seasonal pattern investors watch closely: the \u201cSanta Claus rally.\u201d\nOn Friday, December 26, Wall Street finished essentially flat after a multi-session climb, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 48,710.97, the S&P 500 at 6,929.94, and the Nasdaq Composite at 23,593.10. The moves were tiny\u2014down fractions of a percent\u2014but the bigger story was the calendar: the market is now inside the Santa Claus rally window and just about 1% away from the psychological 7,000 milestone on the S&P 500. [1]\nWith only a handful of trading sessions left in the year, investors have two big questions in view:\n- Can stocks finish 2025 with another leg higher\u2014potentially pushing the S&P 500 through 7,000?\n- Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s next signals reinforce (or challenge) expectations for rate cuts in 2026?\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s driving the conversation\u2014and what could move markets next.\nStock market today: quiet trading, strong weekly gains, and records still in sight\nFriday\u2019s lack of follow-through wasn\u2019t a sign of panic. It looked more like a market pausing after a strong run\u2014especially given the holiday timing and lighter participation.\nTrading volume was muted: Reuters put volume at 10.22 billion shares on U.S. exchanges versus a 15.98 billion 20-day average\u2014exactly the kind of thin liquidity that can make modest orders move prices more than usual. [2]\nDespite Friday\u2019s slight dip, the holiday-shortened week ended on a positive note:\n- S&P 500: +1.4% for the week\n- Dow: +1.2%\n- Nasdaq: +1.2%\nThose weekly gains were echoed across multiple market recaps and helped keep all three major indexes near record levels as 2025 winds down. [3]\nAnd zooming out beyond the week, the year has been strong:\n- S&P 500: +17.82% year to date\n- Dow: +14.49%\n- Nasdaq: +22.18%\n- Russell 2000: +13.64% [4]\nThat \u201cbig picture\u201d strength matters because it frames how investors interpret the next few sessions: is this simply the market coasting into year-end, or is there enough momentum\u2014plus seasonal tailwinds\u2014to push to new highs?\nThe Santa Claus rally: why this tiny slice of the calendar gets outsized attention\nThe Santa Claus rally isn\u2019t a single day\u2014it\u2019s a specific window. In market lore (and common Wall Street shorthand), it refers to the last five trading days of the year plus the first two trading days of the new year. Reuters noted that this period began midweek and runs through January 5, keeping attention locked on late-December and early-January price action. [5]\nA big reason the pattern is closely watched is what it\u2019s thought to signal. As Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick put it, the market is still early in the \u201cofficial\u201d Santa Claus rally period, and he expects a continued upward tilt\u2014while reminding investors that volatility is part of the price of long-term gains. [6]\nSeasonality researchers also track how frequently the Santa Claus period has historically been positive. MarketWatch cited analysis defining the same window and pegging long-run frequency and average performance as favorable over decades of data, while noting recent years can deviate from the pattern. [7]\nTwo important caveats for investors (and readers):\n- Seasonality is not destiny. A Santa Claus rally can fail\u2014even in strong years.\n- Liquidity is thin. Holiday trading can amplify moves in either direction, which is why \u201cquiet\u201d markets can still surprise.\nWhy \u201cS&P 500 at 7,000\u201d has become the year-end headline\nRound-number milestones matter in markets because they compress a complex story into a simple, tradable narrative. The S&P 500 is not far from 7,000, and Reuters reported it was about 1% away after a record close earlier in the week. [8]\nThat milestone carries extra weight because it would land on the heels of a historically persistent run: Reuters noted the S&P 500 was on track for an eight"

But the franchise must brace for the possibility that it will lose one of its top assets.\n\"He's one of the smartest guys when it comes to schemes that I've ever been around,\" cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. said. \"So he can't go anywhere. He's not allowed to go anywhere. No way. I know that everything happens for a reason, and it's always God's plan. But I definitely do not want him to go anywhere. I re-signed here last offseason and told him that he's one of the best coaches that I've been around, and that I wanted to come back and play for him. I don't want him to go anywhere.\"\nFlores continues to operate one of the NFL's most unique schemes, one that has evolved this season to incorporate safety Harrison Smith as a quasi-playcaller on the field. On Thursday, the Vikings dismantled the Detroit Lions' offense, forcing six turnovers, sacking quarterback Jared Goff five times and producing a defensive success rate of 71% -- their second highest in a game since Flores arrived at the start of the 2023 season.\nAmid a season lost long ago to poor quarterback play, the Vikings have evened their record at 8-8. Their defense, which ranks No. 8 in the NFL in defensive EPA per play, is the primary catalyst. In retrospect, coach Kevin O'Connell and Flores flipped a switch during the Week 6 bye as they prepared to reinsert quarterback J.J. McCarthy into the starting lineup.\n\"Our dialogue, was, 'Hey, let's just make sure we're being as aggressive as possible,'\" O'Connell said. \"And that's how [Flores] is by nature. But then also the element of Harrison being able to have a role in what we ultimately play when the ball gets snapped. And he's got an unbelievable feel of the system. ... He's really out there playing a game within the game. And it's been spectacular to watch.\n\"But you learn about each and every year. Teams are different and you learn that you might have to win different ways.\"\nAfter blitzing at a rate of 31.4% before their bye week, the Vikings have blitzed on 51.8% of their defensive snaps since. But Flores has done it in new ways and combinations, in part by relying on Smith to apply the knowledge he has absorbed in his 14-year career to break playcalling tendencies and capitalize on what coaches can't always see from the sideline.\nSmith missed the Vikings' first two games because of a personal health issue that arose during training camp, and he didn't get back to his full-time role until Week 7 -- the same time the Vikings elevated their aggressiveness. Since that point, Flores has regularly -- not on every play, but many -- given Smith the authority to change coverages and blitz alignments before the snap.\n\"Early in the year we were figuring out exactly what our individual roles were,\" Smith said. \"And there was a lot of good, but it wasn't quite as tight. And then we've gotten maybe a little more aggressive in some things. And I think it's more just the belief in that. Without getting too into detail, it's a scheme that most guys have not come up playing with these rules and these techniques and stuff.\"\nNFL coaches often give quarterbacks a series of plays to choose from on offense, but it's less common on defense. Speaking earlier this month about the arrangement, Flores said he first thought about the possibility while coaching now-retired safety Devin McCourty when they were with the New England Patriots in the late 2010s.\n\"I was"

                "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/mens-college-basketball/article/this-s-is-crazy--baylors-addition-of-james-nnaji-further-blurs-line-between-pro-and-college-hoops-175808654.html",
                "body": "'This s*** is crazy' \u2014 Baylor's addition of James Nnaji further blurs line between pro and college hoops\nIt\u2019s rare for a college basketball story to enter the mainstream sports conversation on Christmas Eve, but Baylor\u2019s announcement that it had added center James Nnaji \u2014 the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA Draft \u2014 was enough of a \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d moment for it to break through.\nThough college sports is now professional in almost every sense \u2014 including players who have signed pro contracts in Europe and the NBA G League finding their way to college basketball this year \u2014 the Nnaji development feels like new territory. This isn\u2019t someone who slipped through the cracks or got bad advice, turned pro out of high school and ran into a career dead end. Nnaji, who has been playing in Europe, was one draft slot away from being a first-round pick with a guaranteed NBA contract. He played in the NBA Summer League and has even been part of a trade.\n\u201cSanta Claus is delivering mid season acquisitions\u2026this s*** is crazy!!\u201d UConn coach Dan Hurley wrote on X shortly after the news became public.\nIs this really the type of player who should be part of college basketball? Who knows, maybe Arizona can get LeBron James on the bench for its Final Four push if he wants to play with his son Bryce.\nThat would be absurd, of course \u2014 and, to be clear, expressly against NCAA rules since these pro-to-college cases must take place within five years of high school \u2014 but you can be forgiven if it seems like anything goes these days.\nAnd guess what? As more college programs pursue mid-year additions, some have even checked in with G League players on two-way contracts who have appeared in actual NBA games. That seems inevitable at some point, too, given where this trend seems to be headed.\nBut don\u2019t blame Baylor or any program for pursuing those players.\nWhile you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anyone in college sports who thinks this is a good development, schools are merely doing what the NCAA has given them the green light to do as it waits and hopes for some kind of antitrust protection from Congress that would allow for the actual enforcement of the rulebook rather than a mishmash of eligibility rulings.\nIt\u2019s tempting to wail away on the NCAA\u2019s ineffectiveness here, especially if you\u2019re, say, a Kentucky fan who remembers when the NCAA denied Enes Kanter\u2019s eligibility because he received $33,000 over his necessary living expenses from a pro team in Turkey. That seems picayune compared to what\u2019s happening regularly now, where schools are arranging for far higher payments to European teams just to get players bought out of contracts so they can come to college.\nAt the same time, the NCAA is in an incredibly difficult spot. Its executives and attorneys understand that each time the line of demarcation moves, as it has here, it chips away at the NCAA\u2019s ability to ensure college sports are played by college students, not people who bypassed that opportunity and want to suddenly turn back because NIL has become so lucrative.\nBut the NCAA also sees a legal environment with a deluge of eligibility cases, with some judges granting sixth and seventh years to players. Gonzaga\u2019s Tyon Grant-Foster, who will turn 26 before the NCAA tournament, was originally denied eligibility but granted a preliminary injunction in Washington to play this season \u2014 seven years after he enrolled in junior college.\nNCAA officials would argue nothing major has changed from a policy standpoint; rather, what\u2019s different is the willingness of schools to recruit and enroll those players \u2014 and, of course, the willingness of those players to come play college basketball. Before there was big NIL money involved, it just wouldn\u2019t have been something to consider. Now, it\u2019s often a far more lucrative path than trying to make it to the NBA from the G League.\nThe combination of schools looking for players outside the traditional recruiting realm and judges eroding the NCAA\u2019s ability to enforce eligib"

                "body": "As of 7:57 a.m. in New York (ET) on Saturday, December 27, 2025, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is closed (it\u2019s Saturday night in Tokyo). [1]\nThat timing matters because Japan\u2019s market is heading into a year-end stretch where liquidity thins, macro headlines can move prices faster than usual, and the calendar itself becomes a catalyst. Heading into the weekend, Japan\u2019s benchmarks were still leaning bullish: the Nikkei 225 closed at 50,750.39 (+0.68%) on Friday, December 26. [2] The broader TOPIX ended at 3,423.06 (+0.15%), after touching a record intraday high of 3,436.75. [3]\nBelow is what\u2019s driving the Tokyo tape right now, what the most-cited strategists are forecasting into 2026, and what investors should keep on the radar before the next cash session opens.\nWhere the Tokyo Stock Exchange left off: records, but with a macro asterisk\nFriday\u2019s action looked like the classic late\u2011December mix: risk appetite is still there, but traders are highly sensitive to the two variables Japan can\u2019t ignore right now:\n- the yen, and\n- the interest-rate and bond-yield regime shift underway in Japan.\nThe headline numbers show the tone:\n- Nikkei 225: 50,750.39 at the close on Dec. 26 (+0.68%). [4]\n- TOPIX: 3,423.06 (+0.15%), with a fresh record high at 3,436.75 intraday. [5]\nA key context point for TSE investors: the TOPIX is free-float market-cap weighted, while the Nikkei is price-weighted\u2014so late\u2011cycle leadership can look different depending on whether megacaps or high\u2011priced \u201cindex heavyweights\u201d are doing the lifting. (This difference becomes important when market leadership rotates away from a narrow tech/AI complex toward banks, domestic cyclicals, or value.) [6]\nNew York\u2019s last close matters for Tokyo\u2019s next open\nBecause Japanese cash trading starts while most of the U.S. is still in \u201covernight\u201d mode, Tokyo often takes its first cue from Wall Street\u2019s prior session.\nOn Friday, Dec. 26, U.S. markets ended only slightly lower in thin post\u2011holiday trade:\n- Dow: 48,710.97 (\u20110.04%)\n- S&P 500: 6,929.94 (\u20110.03%)\n- Nasdaq: 23,593.10 (\u20110.09%) [7]\nReuters also noted that traders were watching the seasonal \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d window (last five trading days of the year + first two of the new year). Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick described the mood as markets \u201ccatching our breath\u201d after a strong run\u2014useful framing for Tokyo because it suggests global risk appetite is not broken, just choosy. [8]\nThe yen is the lever: exporters love it\u2014until intervention risk shows up\nIn currency land, the yen remains the real-time \u201cstress gauge\u201d for Japanese equities.\nOn Friday, Reuters reported the dollar at 156.54 yen, with traders staying alert to the possibility of Japanese intervention against sharp moves. [9] That matters for the TSE in a very direct way:\n- A weaker yen can lift the translated overseas earnings of exporters (autos, machinery, tech hardware).\n- But an aggressively weakening yen also raises the political and inflation temperature\u2014exactly the combination that can push policymakers toward action (verbal warnings, intervention, or faster normalization).\nOn the U.S. side of the equation, Reuters also noted that Fed funds futures were pricing roughly two to three 25bp cuts in 2026, with the first potentially as early as March. That rate-path expectation has been one reason the dollar has softened this year\u2014except when Japan\u2019s own fiscal/rates story overwhelms it. [10]\nBOJ policy is no longer background noise\u2014it\u2019s now front-page equity risk\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s pivot away from ultra-loose policy keeps moving from \u201cstory\u201d to \u201cregime.\u201d\nKey recent fact: the BOJ raised its policy rate to 0.75% from 0.5%, a 30\u2011year high, and signaled readiness to keep hiking if its outlook holds. [11]\nTwo investor-relevant implications:\n1) The BOJ is trying to be flexible on timing\u2014but markets read that as ambiguity\nReuters reported that Governor Kazuo Ueda offered limited guidance on the pace/extent of further hikes, which contributed to yen weakness a"
