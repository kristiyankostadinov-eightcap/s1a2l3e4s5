                "body": "- Gold price drifts higher to a fresh all-time high in Monday\u2019s Asian session.\n- The US PCE price index rose 2.7% YoY in August, in line with expectations.\n- Traders await the Fedspeak later on Monday for fresh impetus.\nThe Gold price (XAU/USD) extends its upside to a record high above the $3,800 psychological level during the Asian session on Monday. The precious metal edges higher after the US inflation data came in line with expectations, reinforcing bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may continue with interest rate cuts later this year. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty could boost demand for safe-haven assets like Gold.\nTraders will keep an eye on the Fedspeak later on Monday. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are set to speak. Any hawkish comments from Fed officials might lift the US Dollar (USD) and undermine the USD-denominated commodity price.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Gold edges higher as US PCE data keeps Fed rate cut bets alive\n- US inflation, as measured by the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, rose to 2.7% year-on-year in August from 2.6% in July, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Friday. This figure came in line with the market consensus.\n- The core PCE Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.9% year-over-year in August, matching the increase in July and analysts' estimates.\n- On a monthly basis, the PCE and the core PCE increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.\n- \"Monthly PCE data is in line, though personal income and spending were a tenth above expectations. Nothing from this data will prevent the Fed from carrying on with another cautious rate cut at the October meeting,\" said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader.\n- Markets are now pricing in nearly an 88% odds of a Fed rate cut in October and a 65% possibility of another reduction in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n- US President Donald Trump will meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday as the deadline for a possible government shutdown looms. Without funding legislation, parts of the government would close on Wednesday, the first day of the US government's 2026 fiscal year.\nGold\u2019s positive view remains in place, but overbought RSI warrants caution for bulls\nGold price trades in positive territory on the day. The bullish tone of the precious metal remains intact in the longer term, with the price holding above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart. Nonetheless, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands above the midline near 75.90, indicating the overbought RSI condition. This suggests that further consolidation or a temporary sell-off cannot be ruled out before positioning for any near-term Gold upleg.\nThe crucial resistance level for XAU/USD is seen in the $3,800-$3,810 zone, representing the psychological level and the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band. Sustained trading above this level could take the yellow metal to $3,850.\nOn the downside, the initial support level for Gold is located at $3,722, the low of September 25. Red candlesticks closing below the mentioned level could expose $3,632, the low of September 19.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders.

                "body": "In recent market movements, the price of gold has reached its highest levels today, as reported by Tempo.co. This surge in price can be attributed to various factors influencing the gold market, including economic conditions, inflation, and global events. As gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, many investors are closely monitoring its fluctuations.\n- Understanding the Current Gold Market Dynamics\n- The Significance of Antam Gold Prices\n- Impact on Investors and Consumers\n- Future Outlook for Gold Prices\n- FAQs About the Recent Surge in Antam Gold Prices\n- What factors contributed to the rise in Antam gold prices today?\n- How does Antam\u2019s pricing impact the broader gold market?\n- Are there any predictions for future gold price trends?\n- How can investors protect themselves from price volatility in gold?\n- Where can I find the latest gold prices?\n- How does gold serve as an inflation hedge?\nUnderstanding the Current Gold Market Dynamics\nGold prices are subject to a range of influences that can dramatically alter their value. Today\u2019s rise in the Antam gold price is a reflection of several intertwined elements affecting the commodity market.\nEconomic Indicators\nEconomic indicators such as inflation rates, employment statistics, and interest rates play a crucial role in shaping gold prices. In periods of high inflation, investors typically flock to gold as a means of preserving value. The ongoing concerns about inflation in many economies are likely a contributing factor to today\u2019s price increase. For instance, if the inflation rate rises above the central bank\u2019s target, investors become increasingly worried about the erosion of purchasing power, prompting them to invest in gold as a hedge against inflation.\nGlobal Events and Uncertainty\nGeopolitical tensions and uncertainties also significantly impact the gold market. Events such as conflicts, trade disputes, or unexpected political developments can drive investors towards gold. The current global climate has seen several such events, from ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe to trade disputes between major economies like the United States and China, prompting a shift in investment strategies toward more stable assets like gold.\nFor example, the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East or changes in U.S. foreign policy can lead to increased volatility in global markets, making gold an appealing option for risk-averse investors.\nSupply and Demand\nThe basic economic principle of supply and demand also applies to gold. If demand for gold increases\u2014whether for jewelry, investment purposes, or industrial applications\u2014and supply does not keep pace, prices will rise. Conversely, if supply exceeds demand, prices may fall. The current demand for gold appears to be strong, supporting the recent price hikes. Additionally, global supply chain disruptions, such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, can further strain gold supply, exacerbating price increases.\nThe Significance of Antam Gold Prices\nAntam, short for PT Aneka Tambang Tbk, is one of Indonesia\u2019s leading gold producers and plays a significant role in the country\u2019s gold market. The prices set by Antam are closely watched by investors and traders alike, as they often serve as a benchmark for gold prices within Indonesia.\nHistorical Context of Antam Gold Prices\nTo truly understand the significance of today\u2019s price increase, it is essential to consider the historical context. Over the past months, gold prices have experienced considerable volatility. Factors such as shifting monetary policies, changes in global demand, and currency fluctuations have all influenced Antam\u2019s gold prices. For instance, in the past year, Antam\u2019s gold prices have seen fluctuations from a low of IDR 900,000 per gram to highs nearing IDR 1,200,000 per gram, illustrating the impact of market dynamics.\nComparing Current Prices with Historical Data\nToday\u2019s price marks a notable increase compared to previous weeks and months. For example, if we l"

                "body": "It is turning into gold\u2019s best year in decades. Bullion has hit a series of record highs in 2025, putting it firmly on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, when revolution in Tehran rocked the global economy.\nWhy is gold in such demand? The short answer is that gold is acting as a haven and a store of value, a role it\u2019s played for thousands of years, since the kingdom of Lydia started churning out gold coins in the sixth century BC. Investors can be a jumpy lot, and there are plenty of reasons to shift money out of riskier assets today \u2013 from fears of economic slowdown to rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Nato.\nAs well as traditional valuation drivers such as interest rates, the dollar and inflation, concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the US central bank , his trade war, and his tax and spending plans are also pushing gold higher, analysts say.\nGold\u2019s role as a store of value comes, in part, from its scarcity. According to the World Gold Council, if all the gold ever mined was gathered into a single cube, it would measure approximately 22 metres on each side.\nTotal supplies are rising by an estimated 1.7% per year. That means \u201cno policy, no discovery, no quantitative easing of geology\u201d can debase gold, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.\nThat makes it attractive when investors worry that governments are losing their grip on the public finances \u2013 finding it politically unpalatable to raise taxes, and impossible to cut spending.\nCopper, in contrast, can\u2019t operate as a store of value as huge quantities are used, and consumed, each year, with demand set by the health of the global economy.\nPlatinum and palladium fail this test too, despite an ounce costing over a thousand dollars as new supplies are quickly swallowed up by industry.\nSince 1 January, the spot price of gold has risen by a blistering 43% to $3,760 per ounce. That outpaces all other leading asset classes this year.\nGold hasn\u2019t had such as strong year since 1979, when it jumped by 126% as Iran\u2019s revolution led to a surge in the oil price, crushing investors\u2019 hopes that inflation could be tamed.\nA line graph showing the price of gold steadily rising since the 1970s Data from Bank of America (BofA) on Friday shows that $5.6bn flowed into gold last week. Over the past four weeks, the bank says there were record inflows of $17.6bn.\nBofA cautions that gold is tactically \u201coverbought\u201d, but structurally \u201cunder owned\u201d \u2013 as it only represents 0.4% of private client assets under management. It is maintaining a long position on gold, indicating it expects the price to keep rising.\nGold has further to rise, analysts predict. Arnab Das, global macro strategist at Invesco, for example, says the gold rally still \u201chas legs\u201d.\n\u201cWe see no true alternative to gold as a hedge against US risks and expect central banks to keep buying gold \u2026 In my view, central banks are buying gold because they see no fiat alternative to the dollar,\u201d Das says.\nWho is buying it, and why? The World Gold Council says western investors and speculators have been the drivers of the recent price gains.\nThey cite two reasons. First, evidence that a slowing US economy will allow the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further. That means the interest on cash reserves will be lower, making it less attractive compared with gold (which doesn\u2019t provide a yield).\nSecond, increased rhetoric against the Fed and its independence from the Trump administration is leading to concerns about the stability of the US dollar and the Treasuries market.\nA bar chart showing how much the price of gold has grown since the late 1970s Central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves in recent years. Notably China. Bloomberg reported this week that China aims to become custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves in an attempt to strengthen its standing in the global bullion market, and become less dependent on the dollar and western centres like the US, the UK a"

With Goldman flagging $110 risk if Hormuz is disrupted, CNQ facing tariff strain, and U.S. shale breakevens climbing toward $95, the market sits at the crossroads of geopolitics, tariffs, and supply fragility | That's TradingNEWS\nOil Prices Retreat After Geopolitical Spike \u2013 WTI at $73.55, Brent at $76.78\nCrude markets opened the week on edge after the United States launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, driving WTI futures (CL=F) up as much as 6.2% to $73.55 and Brent (BZ=F) up 5.7% to $76.78 before both benchmarks quickly gave back gains. The retreat signaled that traders are not yet pricing in a sustained supply shock, despite Iran\u2019s threats to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, which handles one-third of global seaborne crude and one-fifth of LNG flows.

CNQ\u2019s free cash flow at $65 oil sits at roughly $4 per share, enabling dividends of $2.35 annually, but its elevated debt of $18.7 billion caps payout flexibility.

The tariff pause for other countries has not been extended to Canada, leaving its producers at a structural disadvantage against U.S. shale barrels.\nWashington Pushes Allies to Lock Into U.S. Shale \u2013 Systemic Risk Emerges\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration has converted oil into a tool of trade diplomacy, pressing India, Japan, Thailand, and the European Union into long-term commitments to buy U.S. crude and LNG. The EU pledged $750 billion over three years, Japan $7 billion annually, while Thailand signed a 20-year, 2 mtpa LNG contract. Vietnam will import 9 mtpa of U.S. LNG by 2030. Yet most U.S. exports consist of light shale oil, which refiners in India and Asia cannot easily process without costly upgrades. U.S. production itself is fragile: shale wells decline 60\u201370% in output within the first year, requiring constant reinvestment. With Brent at $66.80 and WTI in the mid-$60s, production remains viable, but if prices dip below $55, the shale export model could unravel, leaving buyers exposed after investing billions in refinery modifications.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Slides to $2.83 as Mild Weather, Oversupply, and Negative Cash Hubs Pressure Prices\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Climbs to \u00a5149.95 as Policy Divergence and U.S. Labor Data Push Dollar Toward \u00a5151\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nU.S. Shale Breakevens Rising Toward $95 by 2035\nData from Enverus shows the average breakeven for new U.S. shale wells now sits at $70 per barrel, already above WTI\u2019s current $65\u2013$67 range.

                "body": "A new report from big energy data analytics firm Enverus finds that the average breakeven price for new shale wells in the United States currently sits at $70 per barrel. That\u2019s a troubling finding given that the domestic WTI index price has recently hovered in the mid-$60s amid what most consider to be an oversupplied global market for crude.\nMajor Challenges Ahead For U.S. Shale\nBut Enverus finds that things are only likely to become more challenging from here. That breakeven price for U.S. shale is set to keep rising into the future, Enverus finds, and by quite a bit. By 2035, Enverus analysts project the marginal breakeven price will rise to $95 per barrel amid a shift from proven economic drilling inventory to more speculative prospects.\n\u201cAs core shale oil inventory in the U.S. depletes, the industry is entering a new era of higher costs and more complex development. This shift will reshape the cost curve and redefine investment strategies across the continent,\u201d Alex Ljubojevic, director at Enverus Intelligence Research said.\nLiubojevic notes that the maturation of U.S. shale plays and slowing of their pace of production growth has significant implications for the industry\u2019s ongoing ability to meet rising oil demand. \u201cNorth America\u2019s dominance in supplying global oil demand growth is waning,\" he says. \"Over the next decade, its contribution to consumption growth is expected to fall below 50% \u2014 a stark contrast to the previous 10 years when it supplied more than 100%.\u201d\nWhile the predicted rise in marginal costs across a decade seems large in absolute terms, some will point out that the percentage would fall right in line with projections of global inflation and economic growth across the same time frame. That is accurate, but the percentage increases in costs and prices in this infamously cyclical industry have seldom progressed in line with other economic measures.\nThe Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico and the Canadian oil sands have long reigned as the lowest-cost sources of scalable North American oil supply growth, and Enverus sees that dynamic continuing uninterrupted. But no one should think those prolific play areas are immune to the impacts of market dynamics or rapidly shifting government policies.\nShale Executives Weigh In\nThat reality is illustrated by responses by shale executives to the Dallas Federal Reserve bank\u2019s third quarter survey of energy producers, which was released the day after the Enverus report. Many of the executives, whose survey responses are held anonymous, see an industry already in distress amid a set of unfavorable factors.\n\u201cThere are a variety of issues affecting our business,\u201d One executive says. \u201cFirst, excess in the global oil market is restraining oil prices near term. Second, there is continued uncertainty from OPEC+ unwinding production cuts. Third, trade and tariff changes and the resulting geopolitical tensions.\u201d\nPredictability and stability in market factors and government policies have always been key factors to success in the domestic oil and gas industry. High volatility in either area has frequently resulted in downturns in the oil business, and one key sign of a possible downturn has been evident in recent weeks as many companies in both the industry itself and among its service sector have begun to announce significant layoffs of personnel.\nOne executive lays much of the blame on President Donald Trump and his tariff policies, complaining, \u201cThe administration is pushing for $40 per barrel crude oil, and with tariffs on foreign tubular goods, [input] prices are up, and drilling is going to disappear. The oil industry is once again going to lose valuable employees.\u201d Another puts it more bluntly: \u201cThe U.S. shale business is broken. What was once the world\u2019s most dynamic energy engine has been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance.\u201d\nThese are not invalid complaints. There is no question that the dramatic fluctuations in tariff policies by the T"

It has already raised quotas by more than 2.5 million bpd, representing about 2.4 percent of world demand, to boost market share and after coming under pressure from US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices.\nThe eight countries will hold an online meeting on October 5 to decide on November output. Opec+ pumps about half of the world\u2019s oil.\nOpec headquarters and authorities in Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOil prices have fallen from over $80 per barrel at the start of the year but have mostly traded in a narrow range of $60-$70 per barrel since Opec began production increases in April.\nOn Friday prices rose to their highest since August 1, hitting levels above $70 per barrel. This followed Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure, which disrupted refining and shipments from one of the world\u2019s biggest oil exporters.\nThe group\u2019s total output reductions amounted at their peak to 5.85 million bpd, made up of three different elements: voluntary cuts of 2.2 million bpd, plus 1.65 million bpd by eight members, and another 2 million bpd by the whole group.\nThe eight producers plan to fully unwind one element of those cuts \u2013 2.2 million bpd \u2013 by the end of September. For October, they started removing a second layer, of 1.65 million bpd, with an increase of 137,000 bpd.\nOpec+ also gave the UAE approval to boost production by 300,000 bpd between April and September.\nFurther reading:\n- Iraq anticipates huge oil profits as Opec+ output rises\n- Frank Kane: Brent at $50 or $80? The Fed is about to throw the dice\n- Frank Kane: Trump gets lower oil prices but Opec+ faces oversupply\nThe November increase to be discussed on Sunday will amount to at least 137,000 bpd, equal to the October hike, the three sources said. A final decision has not been made, they said.\nOpec+ hikes have fallen short of the pledged amounts because most members are pumping at capacity, analysts have said.\nOpec+\u2019s third group-wide layer of cuts of 2 million bpd is due to last until the end of 2026.\nRegister now: It\u2019s easy and free\nAGBI registered members can access even more of our unique analysis and perspective on business and economics in the Middle East.\nWhy sign uP\nAlready registered?

Economic data remains mixed, with services showing recovery but manufacturing weakness persisting.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone\u2019s econo"

With U.S. jobs data due and eurozone PMIs fading, the battle between 1.1775 resistance and 1.1586 support could set the next major move | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Holds at 1.1771 as Market Awaits U.S. Jobs Data\nThe EUR/USD pair is trading around 1.1771, consolidating after a volatile month where price action has tested both liquidity pockets and major resistance. Bulls remain focused on the 1.1790 level, while short-term traders eye the 1.1750\u20131.1755 support block that has repeatedly cushioned declines. A decisive move below this zone exposes 1.1735, while sustained momentum above 1.1790 could open a run toward the 1.1850\u20131.1867 region, where a prior liquidity sweep left a trail of trapped buyers.\nBearish Technical Signals Emerge as Euro Slips Below Yearly Uptrend\nThe broader weekly structure reveals that EUR/USD has broken below its 2025 uptrend channel, reversing nearly 1.9% off multi-year highs. Resistance at 1.1775 and 1.1917\u20131.2020 has proven too heavy, while key support lies near 1.1586\u20131.1593, the 61.8% retracement of the July rally. A deeper test of 1.1497 \u2014 aligned with the March 2020/2022 highs \u2014 would confirm a larger correction is unfolding. As long as the pair remains below 1.1775, risk is tilted to the downside, especially into the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report.\nLiquidity Sweeps and Fair Value Gaps Dominate Near-Term Structure\nIntraday analysis highlights how EUR/USD\u2019s rejection at 1.1850 triggered a liquidity run, leaving trapped longs and forcing a corrective wave lower. Price action has been gravitating toward a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at 1.1720\u20131.1740, acting as a magnet before deciding the next major move. If the demand block at 1.1750\u20131.1755 continues to hold, bulls could attempt a rebound. But any break beneath opens the path toward 1.1573 and potentially 1.1394, levels that align with multi-year Fibonacci retracements.\nMacro Divergence Reinforces Dollar Strength Against the Euro\nThe technical bearish setup is compounded by policy divergence. The U.S. Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance even after delivering a 25 bps cut in September, while markets price in an 88% chance of another cut in October. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is struggling with sluggish eurozone growth and inflationary pressures, making it harder to tighten policy. U.S. economic strength was reinforced by a 3.8% GDP revision and core PCE inflation at 2.9% YoY, keeping the dollar supported despite rate cut expectations.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Slides to $2.83 as Mild Weather, Oversupply, and Negative Cash Hubs Pressure Prices\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Climbs to \u00a5149.95 as Policy Divergence and U.S. Labor Data Push Dollar Toward \u00a5151\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nKey Events Drive Euro-Dollar Volatility Into October\nThe coming week is loaded with catalysts.

Any upside surprise in U.S. labor markets could reinforce dollar dominance and pressure EUR/USD toward 1.1586 support. In Europe, weaker PMI prints in Germany and the wider eurozone highlight slowing activity, reinforcing bearish bias. Traders must also watch the DXY index holding above 98.00, which keeps the euro under persistent pressure.\nOutlook: EUR/USD Faces $1.1586 Test Before Bulls Regain Control\nThe balance of evidence suggests that the euro is vulnerable in the near term.

Key support rests at 1.2630, while resistance at 1.2850 caps rallies. U.S. economic strength, Fed policy, and Trump tariff risks keep dollar demand high, leaving sterling vulnerable into Q4 | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Under Pressure After Sterling\u2019s 3% September Slide\nThe GBP/USD pair has endured a heavy September, retreating nearly 3% from highs above 1.31 to trade near 1.27 as of September 28. Sterling\u2019s weakness came as U.K. economic momentum cooled while the U.S. dollar strengthened on robust data. In the past week alone, GBP/USD swung between 1.2630 and 1.2850, with traders watching whether the pair can stabilize before the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls release and fresh Bank of England rhetoric.\nKey Technical Levels Define Sterling\u2019s Next Move\nPrice action reveals a fragile structure. Immediate resistance sits at 1.2850, followed by heavier selling pressure near 1.2950. On the downside, the 1.2630 region is critical support, with a break exposing deeper retracement toward 1.2490. Over the past seven days, GBP/USD saw its largest daily move on September 26, when the pound slumped 0.6% or 76 pips, settling at 1.2630. The Relative Strength Index remains neutral around 49, reflecting the lack of directional conviction despite the broader downtrend.\nMacro Divergence Between the U.S. and U.K.\nThe pound\u2019s retreat is linked to diverging macro signals. U.S. GDP growth was revised higher to 3.8% annualized, while the U.K. economy stagnated in Q3, with PMI surveys dipping below 50. At the same time, U.S. Core PCE inflation remains sticky at 2.9%, keeping the Federal Reserve cautious, whereas U.K. inflation cooled toward 3.2%, reducing pressure on the Bank of England to keep rates elevated. Rate differentials now favor the U.S. dollar, pulling capital flows into Treasuries and away from sterling-denominated assets.\nBond Yields and Tariffs Add Extra Dollar Tailwind\nU.S. 10-year yields remain anchored above 4.4%, compared with the U.K. gilt yield closer to 3.8%, reinforcing dollar strength. Meanwhile, tariff risks under Trump\u2019s trade agenda weigh further on global sentiment, disproportionately hurting the U.K. economy given its reliance on exports post-Brexit. Canadian and European partners have already raised concerns, adding indirect pressure to GBP/USD as investors demand higher risk premiums for sterling exposure.\nLiquidity and Positioning Around GBP/USD\nCFTC data shows leveraged funds cutting net long positions on sterling by nearly 12,000 contracts in the past two weeks, flipping positioning closer to neutral after months of bullish exposure. Liquidity in spot markets has thinned, with GBP/USD daily turnover slipping below $290 billion, its weakest since June. This reduction in speculative flows heightens the risk of sharp volatility spikes when major U.S. data hits.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Slides to $2.83 as Mild Weather, Oversupply, and Negative Cash Hubs Pressure Prices\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Climbs to \u00a5149.95 as Policy Divergence and U.S. Labor Data Push Dollar Toward \u00a5151\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nSeasonality and Historical Patterns Point to Weakness\nSeptember and October historically deliver poor performance for GBP/USD.

                "body": "- GBP/USD gains traction around 1.3415 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Softer US PCE inflation fueled confidence in further Fed monetary easing.\n- The BoE maintains a \"gradual and careful\" approach to potential future rate cuts.\nThe GBP/USD pair edges higher to near 1.3415 during the early Asian session on Monday. The US Dollar (USD) weakens against the Pound Sterling (GBP) as the US August inflation report reinforced market expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely proceed with another interest rate cut in October.\nThe US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.7% year-over-year in August, compared to 2.6% in the previous reading, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday. This figure was in line with analyst forecasts. The core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 2.9% YoY during the same period, also matching expectations.\nThe Fed delivered its first cut in the monetary policy meeting in the September meeting, reducing rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.00%-4.25%. Markets are now pricing in nearly an 88% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 65% possibility of another reduction in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nOn the GBP\u2019s front, traders anticipate the Bank of England (BoE) to hold interest rates steady at 4.0% in the remainder of the year, which provides some support to the Cable. The UK central bank is unlikely to cut rates in the near term as inflationary pressures in the UK economy are proving to be persistent.\nLooking ahead, the Fedspeak will be closely watched later on Monday. Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, New York Fed President John Williams, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. If the policymakers deliver hawkish remarks, this could lift the Greenback and cap the upside for the major pair.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports ove"

                "body": "AUD/USD update\nAUD/USD pulls back ahead of RBA interest rate meeting and US labour market update\nAs the Reserve Bank of Australia's meeting nears, AUD/USD declines. Markets monitor RBA actions and US labour updates for future trends.\nInflation impacts and US dollar strength\nAUD/USD finished lower last week at 0.6547 (-0.70%), marking a second consecutive week of declines and about a 2.4% pullback from the 0.6706 high struck in mid-September.\nThe pair's decline occurred despite Australia's higher-than-expected monthly inflation reading last week, which has led markets to temper expectations of multiple Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate cuts in this easing cycle. The Australian dollar came under pressure as the United States (US) dollar extended its broad-based gains that began earlier this month, in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 25 basis point (bp) rate cut.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair sounded less dovish than expected, boosting the greenback. Gains accelerated last week due to stronger-than-expected US economic data, short covering, and month and quarter-end rebalancing flows.\nFactors influencing AUD/USD's next moves\nAUD/USD's next moves will likely depend on risk sentiment, remaining month and quarter-end rebalancing flows, the tone of Tuesday's RBA Board meeting, and Friday's monthly US labour force report. If the RBA's tone on Tuesday is more hawkish and is followed by another weak US non-farm payrolls report that pushes the US unemployment rate higher, AUD/USD should find firmer footing after its recent pullback.\nRBA interest rate meeting\nDate: Tuesday, 30 September at 2.30pm AEST\nAt its last meeting in August, the RBA lowered its official cash rate by 25 bp to 3.60%. The outcome was widely expected by the market and the Board's decision to cut rates was unanimous.\nThe RBA noted progress in reducing inflation, with updated staff forecasts suggesting that 'underlying inflation will continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2-3% range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a gradual easing path.'\nSince then, two higher-than-expected monthly consumer price index (CPI) reports have reinforced expectations that the RBA will keep its cash rate on hold at 3.60% at its meeting tomorrow.\nThis aligns with the RBA's cautious easing approach this year, where a rate cut is followed by a pause at the next meeting. The real focus will be on the tone of the statement and the press conference.\nThe tone is expected to be cautious with an emphasis on data dependence. However, there is some risk it will sound more hawkish if the RBA highlights upside risks to its inflation forecasts.\nThe Australian interest rate market starts the week pricing in 2 bp of rate cuts for tomorrow's meeting and a total of 13 bp, or a 50% probability of a 25 bp rate cut in November.\nRBA cash rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nFollowing a rejection from the 0.6680 - 0.6700 resistance zone in mid-September, AUD/USD began this week with a cautious bounce from trend channel support near 0.6500.\nProvided it continues to hold above 0.6500, it remains within the upward sloping trend channel where it has spent the past five months, with scope to retest resistance near 0.6700.\nHowever, if AUD/USD sustains a break below 0.6500, it could test support at 0.6420, which includes the August lows and the 200-day moving average currently at 0.6404.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView.

The US Dollar (USD) weakens as traders brace for shutdown risks of the United States (US) government, beginning from October 1.\nThe AUD also draws support from fading odds of near-term policy easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), driven by recent data showing a hotter-than-expected consumer price index in August. Markets now price only a 6.5% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at September\u2019s meeting scheduled on Tuesday and 38.2% probability at its subsequent meeting in November.\nAustralia posted a budget deficit of nearly A$10 billion (approximately $6.55 billion) for the year ending June 2025, marking the end of two consecutive years of surpluses. The shortfall was far smaller than the Treasury\u2019s A$27.9 billion forecast.\nAustralian Dollar advances as US Dollar loses ground on Fed rate cut bets\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is losing ground and trading around 98.00 at the time of writing. Traders will likely observe the multiple speeches from the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials later on Monday.\n- The Greenback weakens after the US August inflation report boosted the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely deliver another interest rate cut in October. Markets are now pricing in nearly an 88% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 65% possibility of another reduction in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n- The US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index climbed 2.7% year-over-year in August, compared to 2.6% prior. This figure was in line with analyst forecasts. The core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 2.9% YoY during the same period, also matching expectations.\n- US President Donald Trump will meet congressional leaders on Monday to discuss government funding. Without a deal, a shutdown will coincide with new tariffs on trucks, pharmaceuticals, and more. The standoff could also delay the September payrolls report and other key data, per Reuters.\n- President Trump shared plans to impose a 100% tariff on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, unless a pharmaceutical company is building a manufacturing plant in the US. Trump also unveiled tariffs of 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and 25% on trucks.\n- The US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Annualized grew 3.8% in the second quarter (Q2), coming in above the previous estimate and the estimation of 3.3%. Meanwhile, the GDP Price Index rose 2.1% in the same period, as compared to the expected and previous 2.0% growth.\n- The White House announced that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump will hold their first in-person meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 20 to discuss the Aukus nuclear submarine pact.\n- Australia\u2019s Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), which climbed by 3.0% year-over-year in August, following a 2.8% increase reported in July. The ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures indicate that markets now price just a 4% chance of a September rate cut. According to Reuters, prospects for a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate reduction at its November meeting faded to 50% from almost 70% before the data.\n- RBA Governor Michele Bullock said earlier this week that labor market conditions have eased slightly, with unemployment ticking higher.

With jobs growth forecast at +39k and inflation still elevated, USD/JPY eyes a breakout above \u00a5150.91, extending bullish momentum toward \u00a5154.80 if labor data outperforms | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Breaks to \u00a5149.95 as Dollar Strength and BoJ Hesitation Stretch Divergence\nThe USD/JPY pair ended the week near \u00a5149.95, its highest close in eight weeks, fueled by widening monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The move capped a weekly rally of 1.07%, with the pair climbing from a low of \u00a5147.46 to just shy of the psychological \u00a5150 barrier. Technical momentum accelerated as price cleared the resistance zone around \u00a5148.80, breaking out of a long consolidation band and setting the stage for a potential test of the March high near \u00a5151.30.

The upcoming Summary of Opinions will be closely scrutinized for signals of broader appetite for an October adjustment. Governor Kazuo Ueda faces pressure to address yen depreciation, yet Tokyo\u2019s August CPI slowdown has emboldened dovish voices. Traders note that unless retail sales, Tankan surveys, and labor market data shift decisively hawkish, the yen may continue to face selling pressure against the dollar.\nFed Data Calendar Keeps Dollar Bid as Labor Market Holds Firm\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s strength against the yen is underpinned by robust data. The CB Consumer Confidence Index is forecast to ease slightly to 96, down from 97.4, while JOLTs job openings are expected at 7.1 million. More critical is the September Nonfarm Payrolls, projected at +39,000, following August\u2019s +22,000. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.3%, with average hourly earnings up 3.7% year-on-year. Should payrolls surprise to the upside, Fed officials may hold back from signaling aggressive cuts, reinforcing dollar support. Softer labor numbers, however, could trigger renewed speculation of an October cut, offering the yen a temporary reprieve.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Slides to $2.83 as Mild Weather, Oversupply, and Negative Cash Hubs Pressure Prices\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Sterling at 1.2708 Struggles Against Dollar Strength as Fed Data and NFP Dominate\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Picture Tilts Bullish with Key Levels in Focus\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades firmly above both the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, underscoring bullish momentum.

                "body": "Traders brace for crucial Japanese economic data as the Bank of Japan\u2019s October interest rate decision looms. The USD/JPY rallied 1.02% in the week ending September 26, closing at 149.472. Fading bets on an October BoJ rate hike weakened demand for the yen. However, upcoming economic data could revive expectations of an October interest rate adjustment.\nOn Monday, September 29, finalized Leading Economic Index (LEI) data could influence the BoJ\u2019s policy stance. According to preliminary data, the Index rose from 105.1 in July to 105.9 in August.\nA higher Index reading would signal a positive economic outlook, raising bets on an October BoJ rate hike, boosting demand for the yen. On the other hand, a lower reading may weigh on the yen.\nThe LEI provides traders with insights into business and consumer sentiment, which may affect business investment and consumer spending. Rising trends could signal higher wages and an upswing in consumer spending, potentially fueling demand-driven inflation. However, downward trends may affect the labor market and soften wage growth, supporting a less hawkish BoJ rate path.\nThough the LEI recovered after its April 2025 low of 104.2, it remains well below the March 2024 all-time high of 112.2.\nLater Monday, FOMC members\u2019 speeches could affect US dollar demand and USD/JPY trends. Fed Vice-Chair John Williams and FOMC members Christopher Waller, Beth Hammack, and Alberto Musalem are on the calendar to deliver speeches.\nComments on the recent GDP, jobless claims, and inflation numbers will provide clues about the timing of Fed rate cuts.\nCalls to pause further monetary policy easing to assess labor market and inflation data could send USD/JPY to 150. A sustained move above 150 would bring the August high of 150.917 into play. On the other hand, support for an October rate cut may send the pair below the 149.358 support level. If breached, the 200-day EMA would be the next key technical support level.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Hawkish BoJ vs. Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders consider a potential BoJ rate hike, attention is also turning to the AUD/USD as Aussie data clouds the RBA\u2019s policy outlook.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, speculation about the RBA\u2019s rate path will influence demand for the Aussie dollar. The RBA will announce its interest rate decision on Tuesday, September 30. While economists expect the RBA to maintain its 3.6% cash rate, recent labor market data has boosted bets on a November rate cut.\nHowever, a hotter-than-expected CPI Monthly Indicator, rising from 2.8% in July to 3% in August, has clouded the RBA\u2019s policy outlook. Uncertainty last week sent AUD/USD to a high of $0.66279, signaling potential volatility in the coming sessions.\nWhile labor market and inflation data are crucial for the RBA, trade developments could also affect the RBA\u2019s policy stance. Last week, President Trump announced a fresh wave of tariffs, targeting pharmaceuticals, bathroom vanities, heavy trucks, kitchen cabinets, and upholstered furniture. The latest tariff announcements suggested that tariff threats remain and could potentially weigh on the Aussie dollar.\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock recently remarked on the potential impact of tariffs on the Aussie economy. She reportedly stated that the effect of tariffs on China and other Aussie trade partners could affect the Aussie economy, adding:\n\u201cWhat that means for Australia is not 100 per cent clear\u2026 the extent to which [our partners] are impacted by the change in the world trading order\u2026 does that impact their growth, and therefore, does that impact us?\u201d\nDr. Shane Oliver, Head of Investment Strategy and Chief Economist at AMP, downplayed the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariffs on the Aussie economy. However, on inflation, Dr. Oliver commented:\n\u201cWith inflation showing signs of stickiness above target this has led to concerns that the RBA may not be able to cut much more if at all.\u201d\nDespit"

                "body": "USD/JPY softens to near 149.50 as US PCE data reinforces Fed dovish bets\n|- USD/JPY edges lower to near 149.50 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- US core PCE inflation steadied at 2.9% YoY in August as expected.\n- Expectations that the BoJ might delay rate hikes could undermine the Japanese Yen.\nThe USD/JPY pair loses ground to around 149.50 during the early Asian session on Monday. The US Dollar (USD) softens against the Japanese Yen (JPY) as the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index indicated the Federal Reserve (Fed) is keeping the central bank on pace for interest rate reductions ahead. Traders await the Fedspeak later on Monday for fresh impetus.\nData released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday showed that the US PCE rose 2.7% YoY in August versus 2.6% in July. This figure came in line with the market expectation. The core PCE Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 2.9% YoY in August, matching July's increase and analysts' estimate. On a monthly basis, the PCE and the core PCE increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.\nThough the US central bank targets inflation at 2%, the reports are unlikely to change course for policymakers who last week indicated they see two more 25 basis points (bps) rate cuts before the end of the year. Markets are strongly betting on a rate reduction in October, though there\u2019s a bit less enthusiasm for another move in December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a lot will depend on upcoming economic data.\nOn the other hand, political uncertainty in Japan might weigh on the JPY and create a tailwind for the pair. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election will take place on 4 October and the outcome could delay the next interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) if a candidate with dovish views is selected.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The pair retreated after reaching a four-month high of 1.3958 on Friday as the US Dollar (USD) lost ground after the US August inflation report boosted the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely deliver another interest rate cut in October.\nThe US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.7% year-over-year in August, as expected. The precious reading was a 2.6% increase. Meanwhile, the core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 2.9% YoY during the same period, also matching expectations.\nThe Greenback also faces challenges due to market caution amid shutdown risks of the United States (US) government. US President Donald Trump will meet congressional leaders on Monday to discuss government funding. Without a deal, a shutdown could begin on October 1, coinciding with new tariffs on trucks, pharmaceuticals, and more. The standoff could also delay the September payrolls report and other key data, per Reuters.\nThe downside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) may face challenges amid subdued Crude Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price hovers around $65.00 per barrel at the time of writing.\nOil prices slipped after Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region resumed exports following a 2.5-year halt, adding supply to a market facing surplus risks. Under a new deal with Baghdad, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and international Oil firms, 180,000\u2013190,000 barrels per day (bpd) will initially flow to Turkey\u2019s Ceyhan port.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local cur"

After two weak payrolls reports in July and August, traders may well anticipate a continuation of that trend when the September report is released on Friday, creating an environment where further gains in the greenback may be hard won. With a notable topping pattern on the U.S. dollar index daily chart on Friday, weakness may even eventuate in the days ahead.\nG10 FX tethered to Fed pricing\nBased on the strength of correlations against market pricing for Fed rate cuts out to the end of September next year over the past fortnight, you could argue that little else has mattered for the G10 FX universe recently. The correlation coefficients below underline that point, with scores of +/-0.88 or more with EUR/USD (yellow), USD/JPY (blue), GBP/USD (grey), USD/CHF (purple), USD/CAD (red) and AUD/USD (black). These readings are strong and significant, signalling that over the past two weeks, the U.S. dollar has moved in near lockstep with rate cut pricing. As it swelled, the dollar deflated. As it unwound, the dollar popped.\nSource: TradingView\nLabour data key for Federal Reserve\nEven though most U.S. economic data has topped expectations recently, including incomes and spending last Friday, Federal Reserve officials have indicated that labour market outcomes will have a large sway on how monetary policy will be set in the future. The general message, including from Jerome Powell, is that until there\u2019s evidence labour market conditions are no longer softening, it allows policymakers to look through the recent uptick in inflationary pressures.\nSource: TradingView\nWhether you agree with the approach or not, the Fed\u2019s reaction function appears to be almost entirely driven by just its full employment mandate, especially hiring data. That means not only Friday\u2019s payrolls report could be a major source of volatility, but also Wednesday\u2019s ADP national employment report which, once the government figures have been revised, has been a decent lead indicator on hiring trends within the U.S. private sector.\nOther reports that could shed light on whether the recent slowdown in hiring is due to weaker demand or reduced supply of labour\u2014such as JOLTS, Challenger layoffs, and jobless claims\u2014could also spark meaningful bouts of volatility should they print well away from consensus.\nGiven recent strong economic outcomes, led by the household sector, my sense is the hiring slowdown is more due to seasonal quirks and reduced supply from the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, increasing the risk that labour market outcomes may eventually restrengthen, repeating what was seen in 2024. That ended with a large hawkish recalibration of rate cut pricing and sent the dollar sharply higher. However, until the labour market data begins to match the strength seen in other indicators, it will allow traders to continue leaning into dollar strength on the proviso large scale rate cuts from the Fed are coming.\nDXY technical analysis\nSource: TradingView\nThat may well play out again in the lead up to Friday\u2019s payrolls report, a view bolstered by the dark cloud candlestick pattern completed on the U.S. dollar index (DXY) daily chart on Friday. The topping pattern, after the price rebound stalled at known resistance at 98.60 a day earlier, tilts near-term risks for the DXY lower.\nOn the downside, the confluence of the 50DMA, minor support at 98.08 and September"

                "body": "Gold\nGold markets have rallied quite nicely during the trading week, as we are threatening to break far above the $3800 level. A short-term pullback at this point in time would make a certain amount of sense as we have seen green candles print for 6 weeks in a row now. That being said, any pullback at this point in time will more likely than not end up finding buyers near the $3700 level, assuming that we can even drop that far. Gold is explosive in its momentum but eventually will have to reach lower prices to attract new buyers.\nBitcoin\nBitcoin has fallen rather hard during the course of the trading week, as we continue to threaten the $110,000 support level, an area that previously had been resistance as well as support. We are just a little bit below that level at this point, but there is a \u201czone of support and resistance\u201d meaning that the $107,000 level underneath current trading also offers a certain amount of support. Ultimately, this is a market that is still in an uptrend, but it obviously is struggling to find some type of momentum. That could end up being a bit of a problem and it would not surprise me at all to see this market break down to the $100,000 level, or we now find the 50 Week EMA. On the other hand, if we rally it\u2019s likely that we will try to challenge the $117,000 level.\nSilver\nSilver has had another explosive week as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior overall. That being said, the market is likely to see a certain amount of exhaustion sooner or later, because quite frankly this is a market that will continue to be very interesting, but as we have gained roughly 12% in just a few short weeks, sooner or later gravity comes back into the picture. Any pullback at this point in time should be thought of as a potential buying opportunity, but I also recognize that shorting this market would be very difficult to do, and therefore a little bit of patience probably goes a long way.\nTop Forex Brokers\nUSD/JPY\nThe US dollar has rallied a bit during the course of the week, breaking above the \u00a5149 level. This is a breach of the major consolidation area that we have been in for a couple of months now, and as a result it looks like we are going to continue to see a lot of noise, but I do think it is probably only a matter of time before we test the crucial \u00a5151 level, the top of a major shooting star from about 2 and half weeks ago. If we can break above that candlestick, then it\u2019s likely that the market could go looking to the \u00a5156 level. Short-term pullbacks are possible, and they will continue to offer value, but if we were to break down below the \u00a5146 level, then things will get negative.\nUSD/CHF\nThe US dollar has been back and forth during the previous week, as we continue to see the US dollar try to put in some type of bottom against the Swiss franc in general. The 0.79 level continues to be a major support level, but it\u2019s also noting that the 0.80 level above offers resistance, just as the 0.81 level does. Because of this, the markets are likely to continue to see a lot of choppiness and sideways trading in this general vicinity. Keep in mind that this pair has been sideways for 2 months, and it doesn\u2019t look like it changes anytime soon.\nUSD/MXN\nThe US dollar has been all over the place against the Mexican peso during the week, which is probably not a huge surprise considering that the previous week ended up forming a massive hammer. If we were to break down below the hammer from the previous week, it more likely than not opens up the possibility of the US dollar dropping down to the 18 MXN level. On the other hand, if we do rally from here, then the 18.80 MXN level might be targeted, but that\u2019s essentially \u201cswimming upstream.\u201d\nEUR/USD\nThe euro has been a bit negative this week, but it\u2019s also worth noting that we have been all over the place. We broke above the 1.18 level, only to turn around and collapse toward the 1.1650 level. Ultimately, we are still very much in a sideways market that has a floor a"

Who cares if Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is worth $100,000 or $120,000 per coin, right? Both figures are enough to cover four years of college tuition, or buy a luxury car will all the bells and whistles (yes, even that one!). Sure, you can buy just a small fraction of a Bitcoin at a time, but it can be difficult to wrap your head around these large numbers.\nBut what if you could get exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside without dealing with those intimidating five- and six-figure price tags? Enter the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB), trading at $37.75 per share on September 24, 2025.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\nThat's enough for a nice dinner, not a tricked-out SUV. Let's use the lower stakes of ARKB shares to consider the value and risks of Bitcoin investments.\nSame Bitcoin exposure, friendlier price tag\nFor all intents and purposes, buying shares of ARKB is the same thing as buying Bitcoin directly. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest team is actually buying and selling Bitcoin to reflect the cash being invested in this fund. As an exchange-traded fund (ETF), ARKB brings a couple of small quirks to your Bitcoin investment:\nThere's a modest management fee with an annual expense ratio of 0.21%. It's a bit higher than the 0.01% expense ratios you see in Vanguard ETFs, but it's actually one of the lowest fees in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena.\nWhen Bitcoin prices go up, ARKB's chart will follow. The direct effect remains when the crypto chart is pointing down, too.\nBitcoin is the only holding in the single-asset ARKB fund's portfolio.\nWith $4.86 billion of (pure Bitcoin) assets under management, ARKB is one of the most popular and most liquid spot Bitcoin funds. Investors should have no problem completing trades in this fund at a fair price.\nThe fund currently holds roughly 42,744 Bitcoins in its portfolio, and offers investor access to these assets through 50.3 million ARKB shares. That's how ARKB can provide Bitcoin exposure at such modest share prices -- by dividing a large pie in lots and lots of smaller slices. ARKB will be worth $40 right after Bitcoin passes the $120,000 mark.\nWhy Bitcoin believers are still buying\nNow that you know what the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is, it's time for a more direct investing question. Is ARKB a buy below $40 per share, based on what's going on with the underlying Bitcoin market?\nWell, Bitcoin and related investments have been strong performers lately. These Bitcoin bets have approximately quintupled the 15.7% gains of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index over the last year:\nThat chart includes last November's election results, which brought a more crypto-friendly administration to Capitol Hill. Excluding that surge, Bitcoin's results have been comparable to the stock market in 2025. Generally speaking, the cryptocurrency tends to jump when the economy looks strong and fall when investors feel more pressure. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and many bulls make leveraged crypto investments with borrowed money. That's harder to do when interest rates are high, so macroeconomic moves have a direct impact on this sector.\nThe risks don't shrink with the share price, though\nIn a longer perspective, you have to weigh Bitcoin's potential gains against a plethora of unique risks. Bitcoin maximalists expect the \"digital gold\" to replace the U.S. dollar and physical gold as the preferred methods for storing and transferring money around the world. If that happens, the sky just might be the l"

Alongside Aster and Solana, one rising project \u2014 MAGACOIN FINANCE \u2014 is emerging as a fresh contender in the altcoin spotlight.\nBitcoin ETF Flows Slow and Market Shifts\nThe surge in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF inflows earlier in September signaled peak institutional interest. Between September 8\u201312, ETFs absorbed $2.3 billion, with daily highs reaching nearly $898 million. By September 18, inflows slowed to just $11.6 million, marking an 80% drop.\nSeveral factors explain why Bitcoin ETF flows slow:\n- Profit-taking near resistance levels of $115,000\u2013$118,000.\n- The Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut being priced in, removing some buying urgency.\n- Rotation into Ethereum ETFs, which gained $1 billion mid-month.\nThis cooling period has shifted attention toward altcoin market rotation trends, with analysts flagging new opportunities beyond Bitcoin.\nMany investors are asking what\u2019s the best crypto to buy after Bitcoin ETF slowdown, and the answer often points to the altcoin space.\nAster\u2019s Rapid Rise with Whale Activity\nAster has become a standout in recent trading cycles. A single whale purchase of $50 million worth of ASTER pushed the token to a new all-time high of $2.41. That move alone made the investor the 12th largest holder, owning 0.3% of the supply.\nASTER price chart: Tradingview\nWhy does Aster keep appearing in analysts altcoin picks?\n- Massive Whale Accumulation: Over $48 million worth of ASTER was acquired in just 24 hours, with large buys on Gate.io and Bybit.\n- Mainnet Testing hype: News of \u201cAster Chain\u201d entering its testing phase, featuring sub-second finality and a token buyback program, has stirred speculation.\n- Community Hype: DeFi circles have amplified ASTER\u2019s move, fueling more trading volume and visibility.\nThis momentum positions Aster among the top altcoin rotations of 2025, with some calling it one of the top 3 altcoins to buy in this cycle.\nSolana Gains Institutional Interest\nSolana continues to attract attention for its ecosystem strength. Even with a small price dip, on-chain data shows increasing altcoin market rotation trends favoring SOL. Total value locked in Solana DeFi passed $11.5 billion, up more than 10% quarter-over-quarter.\nInstitutional signals remain strong:\n- Franklin Templeton and Galaxy Digital boosted SOL treasuries.\n- Helius Medical Technologies invested $167 million at $231 per token.\n- Major whales deployed $48 million in SOL buys within 24 hours.\nThe Bitcoin ETF impact on altcoins has left Solana in a unique position. While Bitcoin inflows are cooling, investors see Solana\u2019s active developer base and strong institutional bids as signs it may feature in the best crypto rotation strategies for 2025 investors.\nSOL ETF applications also add to the narrative. The SEC extended its review deadline to October 16, 2025, but many analysts see approval as increasingly likely. This development could place Solana firmly among the best altcoins to buy now amid Bitcoin ETF weakness.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Altcoin Rotation\nAs analysts track the top 3 altcoin rotations analysts recommend in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new name in the mix.\nWhy MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out:\n- Strong Fundamentals: A clear roadmap, transparent team, and focus on delivering long-term ROI.\n- Market Hype: Growing hype around its potential to deliver one of the highest returns among altcoins for the 2025 bull run.\n- Analyst Recognition: Positioned among analyst altcoin picks for its ability to ride the rotation narrative.\nWith institutional attention shifting from Bitcoin into dynamic altcoin plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE benefits directly.

Read More\nXRP ended the week at $2.78, with traders eyeing a pivotal October as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prepares to rule on six spot ETF applications. The window between October 18 and October 25 could determine whether XRP joins Bitcoin and Ethereum as the third cryptocurrency with U.S.-listed spot ETFs.\nApplications from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, and WisdomTree are under review. Analysts argue that approval could unlock new institutional flows, particularly as liquidity rotates from Bitcoin\u2014already buoyed by its spot ETF launches\u2014into XRP.\nXRPR launched on September 18 but broader approvals will accelerate adoption. Market is already looking up, XRP hit an intraday high of $2.82 today.\nInstitutional Appetite Expands via Derivatives\nBeyond ETFs, XRP is gaining momentum in the derivatives market. CME Group data shows open interest in XRP futures has surpassed $1 billion, the fastest growth among crypto derivatives this quarter. CME will also launch XRP and Micro XRP options on October 13, offering regulated exposure to a wider investor base.\nRipple\u2019s bid for a U.S. national bank charter, currently under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), adds another layer of credibility. If granted, Ripple would gain direct access to the U.S. banking system, a move that could boost confidence among large investors.\nKey drivers supporting institutional demand include:\n- Surging futures open interest above $1B\n- Pending CME XRP options launch on October 13\n- Ripple\u2019s U.S. bank charter application under OCC review\n- SEC rulings on multiple spot ETF applications in October\nXRP Technical Outlook: Triangle Tightens\nTechnically, the XRP price prediction remains neutral, as XRP has been stuck in a descending triangle since July, characterized by lower highs against a stable floor at $2.70. The 50-day MA at $2.96 is capping the rallies, with long upper shadows showing sellers defending the area. The 100-day MA at $2.61 is the near-term support.\nCandles are showing hesitation.\nPast declines formed sequences resembling three black crows, confirming bearish momentum. More recent small-bodied candles with long shadows reveal indecision, with neither side in full control.\nThe RSI at 40 suggests muted momentum, hovering above oversold but lacking bullish divergence. A breakout requires higher lows above $2.70 or a bullish engulfing candle at the support level.\nTrade Scenarios:\n- Bearish case: Short entries on failed rallies near $2.90, targeting $2.70 and $2.59, with stops above $2.95.\n- Bullish case: Long setups gain traction only on a daily close above $3.00, with upside toward $3.25 and $3.42.\nIn plain terms, XRP sits at a crossroads. Institutional catalysts in October\u2014ETF approvals, CME options, and Ripple\u2019s bank charter\u2014may provide the spark. However, until the price breaks free from the tightening triangle, rallies risk fading, and shorts hold the upper hand. A breakout above $3.00 could mark the beginning of XRP\u2019s next major leg higher.\nPresale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

                "body": "The SEC\u2019s Spring 2025 agenda has caused ripples in the cryptocurrency market, casting uncertainty over major tokens. As regulatory developments unfold, investors are closely monitoring the impact on Ethereum and Solana, as the market anticipates potential policy changes. Trading activity has become cautious, with participants reassessing risk exposure amid broader market turbulence. Analysts are tracking the movement of sentiment as regulatory clarity or uncertainty could impact short-term volatility and longer-term investment strategies.\nIn this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to make a name for itself. The Ethereum-based token is garnering traction as analysts forecast that it could benefit from increased transparency regarding SEC rules while market trust evolves.\nSEC Regulatory Agenda and Digital Assets\nThe SEC Spring 2025 agenda puts digital assets at the center of its policy program. It aims to provide clearer guidelines for the issuance, custody, and trading of cryptocurrencies while ensuring investor protection.\nDeregulatory measures include streamlining fundraising channels, lessening operational burdens, and re-evaluating the Consolidated Audit Trail system to balance cost against security oversight considerations. Analysts believe that these measures could provide confidence and institutional participation, creating opportunities for projects that comply with them. Investors consider that greater regulatory clarity could help ease uncertainty, boosting adoption and liquidity across digital assets.\nEthereum Price Outlook\nEthereum has been under pressure short term after recent highs. The initial small ascending channel from the prior weeks broke down, signaling a change of momentum. RSI has declined towards 40, indicating a weakening bullish strength without reaching extreme oversold levels. Traders are paying close attention to key support levels around $4,200 and $4,000.\nExchange netflows show consistent ETH outflows, indicating coins moved to self-custody or staking. Nonetheless, this decreases selling pressure and offers medium- to long-term bullish support. Despite short-term technical weakness, Ethereum\u2019s broader fundamentals remain strong, supported by institutional interest and ongoing network improvements.\nAnalysts have pointed out that if support holds, ETH could make a higher low and retest previous resistances. Conversely, failure to hold these zones may intensify selling pressure, raising the chances of deeper retracements. Momentum indicators indicate consolidation ahead of a bullish recovery.\nSolana Price Outlook\nSolana has fallen by 10% recently but bounced back to yield a higher low. Despite the downward shift, the higher highs and higher lows since April have held. Long-term horizontal resistance is near $250, which has proven difficult for the price to break since 2021. It reached an all-time high of $295 earlier this year.\nBased on technical wave theory, SOL appears to be in the fifth of five waves up that it is moving in. A bullish move above $250 could break through overhead resistance and initiate a parabolic rally. Further upside targets include Fibonacci retracement levels between 0.064 and 0.071 ETH.\nAnalysts believe Solana can outperform Ethereum throughout the remainder of 2025 with continued momentum. Volume patterns show strong accumulation around recent lows, which supports upside potential. Traders are closely observing resistance and liquidity zones to determine the direction of Solana\u2019s upcoming rally.\nSolana vs Ethereum: A 2025 Blockchain Showdown\nIn 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain the top smart contract environments, but their courses are unique. Solana is known for speed, processing thousands of transactions per second with low latency. With its unique combination of Proof of History and Proof of Stake, this network is primed for high-frequency applications like gaming and DeFi in real-time, providing a competitive advantage that drives swift adoption.\nOn the other hand, Et"

                "body": "Ethereum Gas Relief Brings Headlines, But Not Full Safety\nEthereum\u2019s network has finally given users a break. Gas fees dropped to as low as $0.18, making transactions cheaper than they\u2019ve been in years. For developers, DeFi traders, and NFT enthusiasts, this is welcome news. Lower fees mean more activity and fewer complaints about Ethereum\u2019s high costs.\nBut there\u2019s a catch. Even with fees this low, Ethereum still doesn\u2019t solve one of crypto\u2019s biggest problems: fraud and manipulation. The market is filled with scams, rug pulls, and meme tokens that disappear overnight. Cheaper fees don\u2019t protect investors from losing money in projects that were never safe to begin with.\nEthereum Average Gas Price History Graph. Source: ycharts.com\nWhy Retail Traders Still Feel Vulnerable\nRetail investors know the pattern all too well. They join a trending meme coin, only to watch whales pump and dump it within days. Some projects vanish with liquidity drained, leaving holders empty-handed. Ethereum\u2019s lower costs make entry easier, but the risk of falling for scams remains just as high.\nThis is why meme investors are starting to look beyond transaction fees. They want a token that not only rides culture and virality but also has protections against fraud.\nMAGAX Enters as a Meme Coin That Values Security\nThat\u2019s where MAGAX is catching attention. Unlike most meme projects, MAGAX was designed with fraud filters and trust mechanisms built in. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale at $0.000293 per token, MAGAX has already separated itself from the rest of the meme pack by putting investor security first.\nThe team has partnered with CertiK for a professional audit, ensuring the project\u2019s contracts are safe from backdoors or hidden risks. At a time when retail traders are tired of scams, this step has made MAGAX one of the most credible meme tokens entering the market in 2025.\nFraud Filters That Protect the Community\nWhat does it mean when analysts call MAGAX a token with \u201cfraud filters\u201d? It means the project has systems and practices that block common threats to investors.\n- Audit transparency: CertiK\u2019s review builds confidence before launch.\n- Presale fairness: Pricing is open and clear. Stage 2 investors know exactly what they are buying into.\n- Anti-whale dynamics: The tokenomics prevent a handful of wallets from controlling the market.\n- Community-driven model: Rewards go to participants, creators, and promoters, not just speculators.\nBy blending meme energy with structured safeguards, MAGAX gives retail investors something they rarely get: a fair shot at growth.\nMeme-to-Earn: Culture With a Paycheck\nSecurity is only half the story. MAGAX also introduces a Meme-to-Earn model, where creativity is rewarded with tokens. Community members who create and share viral content can earn directly. This turns meme culture into an economy, not just entertainment.\nFor Gen Z and younger investors who live online, this model resonates. They already create and spread memes daily\u2014MAGAX simply gives them a way to get paid for it. It\u2019s a viral loop that builds culture, community, and token adoption all at once.\nWhy Analysts See 1000%+ Potential\nAnalysts are tagging MAGAX as one of the few tokens in 2025 that could realistically deliver 1000%+ gains for early backers. The logic is simple: presales at under a cent provide huge upside if the token gains traction post-listing.\nUnlike tokens that rely only on hype, MAGAX combines cultural power with investor protection. That balance makes it attractive to both risk-takers and cautious retail buyers.\nSecure Your Spot Before Stage 2 Ends\nEthereum\u2019s fee relief is great, but cheaper transactions don\u2019t guarantee safer investments. MAGAX, on the other hand, combines low entry price, strong security, and viral energy into one package. It\u2019s a project designed for retail investors who are tired of being last in line.\nStage 2 presale is almost sold out at $0.000293 per token.

                "body": "September 28, 2025 \u2013 The Solana ecosystem is on the cusp of a revolutionary transformation. Jump Crypto's Firedancer team has put forth a groundbreaking proposal, SIMD-0370, to eliminate the network's fixed per-block compute unit (CU) limits. This ambitious initiative, coming on the heels of the highly anticipated Alpenglow upgrade, aims to usher in an era of dynamic scalability for Solana, allowing block capacity to adjust organically based on validator performance. While promising a significant boost to throughput and efficiency, the proposal has ignited crucial discussions around potential centralization risks, setting the stage for a pivotal period in Solana's evolution.\nA Bold Step Towards Dynamic Throughput: Unpacking SIMD-0370\nThe Firedancer team's proposal is a direct response to the limitations of static block sizing. Currently, Solana (SOL) operates with a fixed block compute unit limit of 60 million CUs, with previous discussions (SIMD-0286) to increase it to 100 million CUs. SIMD-0370 fundamentally shifts this paradigm, advocating for blocks to scale dynamically, limited only by the processing capabilities of the most performant validators on the network. This change is designed to create a \"performance flywheel effect,\" where well-capitalized block producers are incentivized to continuously upgrade their hardware to pack more transactions, thereby earning higher rewards and driving overall network capacity.\nThis dynamic scaling mechanism is deeply intertwined with Solana's monumental Alpenglow upgrade. Alpenglow, which garnered near-unanimous validator support (over 99%) in a vote that concluded on September 4, 2025, is scheduled for testnet deployment in December 2025, with mainnet activation anticipated in Q1 2026. This upgrade represents Solana's largest protocol overhaul to date, introducing new consensus mechanisms (Votor and Rotor) that replace the traditional Tower BFT and Proof of History, dramatically reducing transaction finality from approximately 12.8 seconds to an astounding 100-150 milliseconds. Crucially, Alpenglow also introduces a \"skip-vote\" mechanism, enabling validators with less powerful hardware to automatically abstain from voting on oversized blocks they cannot process in time without disrupting the chain.\nFiredancer, itself a high-performance validator client developed by Jump Crypto, is central to this vision. Written in C++ for optimal efficiency, Firedancer has already demonstrated the ability to process over 1 million transactions per second (TPS) in testing environments. Its independent implementation enhances client diversity, thereby bolstering overall network security and resilience against single-client bugs\u2014a critical improvement given Solana's past network stability challenges. The SIMD-0370 proposal, submitted around September 28-29, 2025, is currently in its review phase, positioned to capitalize on Alpenglow's foundational improvements.\nKey players in this development include the Firedancer team and its parent company, Jump Crypto, who are the proponents of SIMD-0370. The Solana Foundation oversees the broader ecosystem development and governance. Anza, the company spun out from Solana Labs responsible for Solana's core development and the Agave client, spearheaded the Alpenglow upgrade. Roger Wattenhofer, Head of Research at Anza, has expressed support for the general concept of removing compute limits while also voicing concerns about potential centralization. Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic, with Solana's (SOL) price seeing a modest surge around the time of the proposal's submission, reflecting investor enthusiasm for enhanced network capabilities.\nWinners, Losers, and the Shifting Sands of the Solana Ecosystem\nThe Firedancer team's proposal, coupled with the Alpenglow upgrade, will undoubtedly reshape the competitive landscape within the Solana ecosystem and beyond, creating clear winners and posing significant challenges for others.\nPotential Win"

Despite pressure, the token avoided a decisive breakdown below $200. Trading volume came in at $7.48 billion, while market capitalization remained above $120 billion. Price action shows that $200 is becoming a critical psychological floor. Bulls are watching the Volatility Stop (VStop) resistance at $215.24, which must be broken to reverse bearish momentum and ignite a rally toward higher levels.\nWrapped Bitcoin Flows on Solana Surge Past $1 Billion\nLiquidity into Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem continues to build. The supply of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Solana crossed $1 billion, with five consecutive months of growth recorded since May 2025. This steady inflow signals that Bitcoin holders increasingly view Solana as a yield-bearing network for BTC deployment. By absorbing $1 billion of assets, Solana has secured fresh liquidity that has played a crucial role in protecting prices from slipping under $200 during periods of low spot demand.\nCyber Hornet ETF Filing Could Expand Wall Street Exposure to Solana Futures\nInstitutional adoption received a boost when Cyber Hornet Trust filed with the SEC to launch ETFs that combine S&P 500 equities with crypto futures, including Solana. One vehicle allocates 75% to U.S. equities and 25% to Solana futures, with Nasdaq listing plans pending approval. While Cyber Hornet\u2019s Bitcoin product holds a modest $6 million in assets, Solana\u2019s inclusion reflects growing interest in bringing SOL into regulated, institutional portfolios. Even before approval, ETF speculation often triggers inflows, and traders are positioning for volatility around this development.\nTechnical Setup: Resistance at $216, Support at $194, Targets Above $239\nChart indicators highlight a tightening range. The Keltner Channel midline at $216.98 is the immediate resistance that bulls must reclaim. A breakout above it could drive momentum toward the upper channel at $239.24, with potential extension to $250. On the downside, the lower band at $194.72 is the key level preventing a larger correction. The RSI at 42.28 shows SOL still in bearish territory but tilting higher, reflecting gradual accumulation below $205. Unless SOL closes below $194, the setup leans toward an upward rebound.\nDeFi, NFT Activity, and Network Upgrades Strengthen Long-Term Case\nBeyond short-term moves, Solana\u2019s core ecosystem remains robust. Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost, Solana has become a foundation for DeFi protocols, NFT markets like Magic Eden, and blockchain gaming applications. Institutional developers continue to choose Solana for low-cost scalability. Analysts project that by 2030, Solana could realistically trade in the $500\u2013$750 range, provided DeFi adoption continues at its current pace and institutional capital deepens. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade is expected to address historical outage issues, which previously weighed on confidence.\nScalability Questions and Market Cap Size Limit Explosive Returns\nEven with strong fundamentals, expectations of another 100x run for SOL are unrealistic. At a market cap above $120 billion, a 100-fold rally would imply valuations in the tens of trillions \u2014 greater than the combined size of Bitcoin and Ethereum today. Network downtime, while reduced, still remains a concern for investors wary of scalability risks. Competition is intensifying as Ethereum Layer 2s undercut fees and settlement times, challenging Solana\u2019s long-term dominance. These factors explain why analysts limit near-term bullish forecasts to $25"

        "market_summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading near record highs, driven by a powerful rally in tech stocks fueled by massive AI investments, particularly from companies like Nvidia. However, this performance is juxtaposed with underperformance from several key dividend components, such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Sherwin-Williams, which are facing headwinds from inflation, consumer spending pressures, and high interest rates. Elevated market valuations and record-high household equity exposure are flashing warning signs, creating a market environment of significant optimism tempered by underlying fragility and concentration risk.\nSENTIMENT: Mixed\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Mixed",

On the other hand, smaller up-and-coming companies will want to put all the dry powder possible into their ideas to make them succeed.\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.52%), Procter & Gamble (PG 0.21%), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW 0.58%) are three industry-leading companies that have been around for over 100 years. Their track records have earned them spots among the 30 components in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.65%).\nDividends have been an integral part of their capital allocation plans for decades. And because all three companies have steadily grown their earnings over time, they have also been able to increase their quarterly dividends.\nInvesting $15,000 into each stock could help you generate over $1,000 in passive dividend income per year. Here's why all three dividend stocks are great buys in October.\nThis beverage behemoth is also a passive income powerhouse\nCoca-Cola was one of the few stocks that held up when the market was tanking in response to tariff woes and geopolitical uncertainty in April. That same month, it hit an all-time high. But since then, Coke has been steadily falling while the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.59%) has been gaining. And after a hot start to the year, Coke is now underperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\nCoke's fundamentals remain intact. The company is generating solid organic growth and diversifying its beverage lineup by leaning into healthier options. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke are performing well, and Coke is shifting from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in the U.S.\nCoke has the beverage lineup, supply chain (through its bottling partnerships), and brand power to adapt to changing consumer preferences. In the meantime, the stock has gotten much cheaper, sporting a 23.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 10-year median P/E of 27.7.\nCoke yields 3.1%, making it a solid source of passive income. And it has raised its dividend for 63 consecutive years, earning it a coveted spot on the list of Dividend Kings.\nP&G is a great value for long-term investors\nP&G is in a similar boat to Coke. It has great brands, but consumers are getting hit hard by inflation and cost-of-living pressures.\nIn June, P&G announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs and exit certain brands and markets as part of a restructuring effort. In July, it announced that its chief operating officer, Shailesh Jejurikar, would take over as CEO on Jan. 1, 2026. These major shakeups, paired with relatively weak results and guidance, may be why P&G is hovering around a 52-week low at the time of this writing.\nP&G has essentially three levers it can pull to grow its earnings. It can sell higher volumes of products, it can raise prices, and it can repurchase stock, which increases earnings per share. Volume growth is the most sustainable option because it has fewer limits compared to price increases, which are subject to consumer constraints. And there's only so much free cash flow P&G generates to buy back its stock (it usually reduces its share count by 1% to 2% per year).\nUnfortunately, P&G has been relying heavily on price increases in recent years. And consumers are pushing back, as P&G's organic growth has drastically slowed.\nP&G now sports a P/E ratio of 23.4 and a forward P/E of 21.8 compared to a 10-year median P/E of 25.5. Like Coke, P&G is a Dividend King with a high yield at 2.8%. It's a great buy for risk-averse investors looking for a reliable source of passive income who don't mind giving the company time to restructure.\nSherwin-Williams' recent pullback is a buying opportunity\nThe paint and coatings giant had been a steady market outperformer to the point where it earned its spot in the Dow last year, replacing commodity chemical giant Dow Inc. But Sherwin-Williams' stock has underperformed the major indexes this year largely due to high interest rates, which are impacting many of its end markets.\nSherwin-Williams benef"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) climbed to 46,247.29, up 0.65% on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) reached 22,484.07, adding 0.44%. These levels represent an extraordinary rally driven by artificial intelligence, consumer resilience, and household equity exposure, but they also highlight risks as valuations stretch. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 sits at 22x, trailing P/E at 28x, and the CAPE ratio at 40x, a level unseen since the 2000 dot-com bubble. Investors are betting heavily on sustained earnings growth over the next decade, but these valuations leave little margin for error.\nArtificial Intelligence Spending Spree Pushes Nasdaq Higher\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s relentless climb is being powered by multi-hundred-billion-dollar AI infrastructure commitments. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged after pledging a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which itself sealed a $300 billion agreement with Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) under the Stargate program. CoreWeave\u2019s contracts swelled to $22.4 billion, nearly doubling from earlier commitments. This comes on top of Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ: AVGO) $10 billion customer deal, which analysts also tie back to OpenAI. Nvidia is effectively financing its own revenue growth \u2014 a system where capital inflows also return as GPU sales revenue. NVDA stock advanced more than 4% last week, and year-to-date it remains the dominant force behind tech\u2019s performance. Still, skeptics warn that this cycle resembles vendor financing during the dot-com era, raising concerns of a fragile foundation beneath the AI boom.\nHouseholds\u2019 Record Exposure to Equities Could Amplify Any Downturn\nFederal Reserve data shows that stocks now account for 45% of U.S. households\u2019 financial assets, surpassing the late-1990s peak just before the dot-com bust. The S&P 500\u2019s 33% rebound since April 8 has inflated personal balance sheets, but it has also concentrated household wealth in a single asset class. The Magnificent Seven \u2014 NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, META, GOOG, TSLA \u2014 now control 34% of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, contributing about 41% of its gains this year. While this concentration magnifies upside potential, it also raises systemic risks: if even two or three of these giants stumble, index-level downside could be severe.\nMacro Catalysts: September Jobs Report and Federal Reserve Outlook\nThe September U.S. employment report, due Friday, will be the week\u2019s pivotal release. August added just 22,000 jobs, the weakest monthly gain of the year, while unemployment edged higher. Inflation remains sticky, with the core PCE price index up 2.9% year-over-year in August, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Jerome Powell described the policy backdrop as \u201cchallenging,\u201d caught between rising unemployment and lingering inflation pressure. Treasury yields softened last week, fueling equity gains, but traders will be closely watching Fed speakers including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack for policy signals. A weak jobs print could accelerate expectations of further rate cuts, but it also risks raising recession fears.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Sli"

Recent financial results show net income growth to C\u00a5645.83 million for the first half of 2025, despite a slight decrease in sales compared to last year, supporting its ability to maintain dividends.\nOverview: Inpex Corporation is involved in the research, exploration, development, production, and sale of oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources both in Japan and internationally with a market cap of \u00a53.30 trillion.\nOperations: Inpex Corporation's revenue is primarily derived from its Oil & Gas Overseas - Other Project segment at \u00a51.55 trillion, followed by the Oil & Gas Japan segment at \u00a5212.16 million and the Oil & Gas Overseas - Ichthys Project at \u00a5362.09 million.\nDividend Yield: 3.6%\nInpex Corporation's dividend strategy is supported by a low payout ratio of 25.6%, ensuring dividends are well-covered by earnings and cash flows. Recent announcements highlight an increase in interim and year-end dividends to \u00a550 per share, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns amid improved financial forecasts. The company's buyback program further enhances capital efficiency, while its dividend yield of 3.6% ranks among the top in Japan, underscoring its attractiveness for income-focused investors.\nOverview: Yamaguchi Financial Group, Inc., along with its subsidiaries, offers a range of banking products and services in Japan and has a market capitalization of approximately \u00a5392.64 billion.\nOperations: Yamaguchi Financial Group, Inc. generates its revenue primarily through its Banking Business segment, which accounts for \u00a5171.17 billion.\nDividend Yield: 3.4%\nYamaguchi Financial Group's dividend payments have been stable and reliable over the past decade, with a payout ratio of 38.1% indicating strong coverage by earnings.

Despite a lower-than-market-average dividend yield of 3.44%, the group's earnings growth forecast of 13.66% per year supports potential future increases in shareholder returns.\nAre you invested in these stocks already?

With a market capitalization of CN\u00a55.05 billion, it focuses on delivering energy solutions while managing costs associated with production and distribution.\nNingbo Shimao Energy, a small player in the energy sector, has seen its earnings grow at 7% annually over the past five years. Despite this steady growth, recent earnings for the first half of 2025 showed a dip with sales at CNY 128.49 million and net income at CNY 63.17 million compared to last year\u2019s figures. The company boasts high-quality earnings and operates debt-free, a significant improvement from five years ago when its debt to equity ratio was 14.5%.

Here\u2019s what you should know before the ASX opens today\u2026\nAt 7am AEST Monday, ASX futures were pointing 0.2% higher\u2026barely a ripple, but hey, green is green.\nHere\u2019s what the US markets got up to last Friday.\nWall Street\u2019s comeback\nAfter three straight down days, Wall Street finally remembered how to bounce.\nThe Dow was up by 0.65%, the S&P 500 by 0.59%, and the Nasdaq by 0.44% \u2013 but the week still ended in the red.\nThe Fed\u2019s pet inflation gauge (PCE) came in line with expectations at 2.9%, which was enough for traders to breathe a sigh of relief.\nBut the University of Michigan survey quickly soured the mood, showing US consumers reckon the economy\u2019s going to the dogs. Around 44% of households said high prices are chewing through their wallets.\nIn US stock news, Boeing jumped 4% after the FAA gave it back the authority to perform final safety checks on its 737 Max jets \u2013 a vote of confidence after last year\u2019s string of mishaps, including that door plug blowout.\nAnd, Trump reckons TikTok should be spun out of ByteDance for just US$14 billion, which is laughable when analysts say it could fetch closer to US$40 billion.\nShutdown season\u2026 again\nThe US government shutdown circus is back, and this season both sides look weirdly keen to let it happen.\nTrump\u2019s team is already telling agencies to prep for layoffs under the banner of \u201cefficiency\u201d.\nMarkets usually treat these shutdown dramas like background noise. But this time, the timing stinks.\nThe government could grind to a halt as soon as Wednesday, with Trump set to meet Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\nArgentina\u2019s copper gamble\nOver in Argentina, president Javier Milei is trying to resurrect copper production after a seven-year drought.\nMcEwen Copper\u2019s Los Azules project just scored tax breaks under a fancy scheme with the catchy name RIGI.\nIt\u2019s a US$2.7 billion play that could churn out US$1.1 billion in exports a year, assuming the financing shows up.\nRio Tinto and Stellantis are already in the register, which gives it credibility.\nThe mine sits 3,500m up in the Andes and plans to use a water-saving leaching method, handy in a country where protests are as common as empanadas.\nAnd, the week ahead\u2026\nThe RBA meets this week but odds are it won\u2019t budge on rates.\nExperts believe the RBA will keep powder dry for November, unless inflation plays spoiler again.\nThe ABS also drops household spending data Thursday.\nEconomists tip another 0.3% rise, which makes sense when unemployment\u2019s low and dividends are raining down like confetti.\nSpeaking of dividends, about $88.5 billion lands in Aussie pockets this week, according to Commsec.\nThat\u2019s a lot of cash to be recycled into stocks, or blown on Bali trips.\nCommodity/forex/crypto market prices\nWhat got you talking\nAlso in the news\u2026\nMonsters of Rock: How miners shape up on dividends; plus lithium developers eke out gains.\nTrump\u2019s angling for a slice of Lithium Americas and that\u2019s a win for ASX critical mineral juniors.\nGold will be $10,000 one day \u2013 it\u2019s a question of when, say these miners.\nAI is now a central driver of worldwide growth, writes Nigel Green.\nMoneyTalks: Aliwa Funds\u2019 undervalued golden trio to hatch in next commodity cycle.\nHigh Voltage: DRC kicks off new cobalt export quota system.\nTrading halts\nHillgrove Resources (ASX:HGO) \u2013 cap raiseTesoro Gold (ASX:TSO) \u2013 cap raiseTungsten Mining (ASX:TGN) \u2013 cap raiseVEEM (ASX:VEE) \u2013 cap raise and material contract\nAt Stockhead, we tell it like it is.

                "body": "Porsche AG shares fell almost 10% last week-the steepest drop since its 2022 debut-after the carmaker scaled back its electric-vehicle ambitions. The stock is down nearly 30% this year and will fall out of Germany's benchmark DAX index. Parent company Volkswagen also slid 8.4%, its sharpest drop in more than two years, according to Bloomberg.\nThe 911 maker scrapped plans for a battery-powered luxury SUV and will instead expand its lineup of combustion-engine and hybrid cars. The shift triggered a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8 billion hit to operating profit, Porsche's fourth profit warning this year, and pushed both Porsche and VW to cut their earnings outlooks. VW also flagged a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 billion impairment tied to the move, lowering its forecast for operating return on sales to just 2% to 3%, down from as much as 5%.\nBloomberg writes that auto buyers \"are putting little value on luxury electric cars,\" said Matthias Schmidt, an independent analyst near Hamburg. \"Porsche has now realized this and is jumping back into high-margin combustion-engine models.\"\nThe setback underscores the wider struggles of Germany's auto sector. Porsche faces weak demand in China, where local champion BYD dominates EVs, and has been hit hard by U.S. tariffs in its largest market. Luxury spending is muted, and analysts say Porsche has disappointed investors since its blockbuster listing. \"Porsche has now been disappointing investors for over two years,\" Citi's Harald Hendrikse wrote. \"It is hard to conclude that these disappointments have now completed.\"\nVolkswagen, once an EV frontrunner, is also scaling back battery plans and restructuring to cut costs. While VW outsold Tesla, Stellantis and BYD in Europe this year with several affordable EVs, its premium brands-Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini and Ducati-have weakened, with shipments falling across major markets.\nPorsche has already replaced executives, scrapped its in-house battery program, and announced job cuts to reduce costs. But the crisis is fueling calls for CEO Oliver Blume-who leads both Porsche and VW-to step aside from running Porsche so a new leader can attempt a turnaround.\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nThe leading economics blog online covering financial issues, geopolitics and trading.

EPS of $2.31 was also above estimates calling for $2.18 a share. YouTube ad revenue soared to $9.8 billion, beating estimates of $9.56 million. Google Cloud revenue of $13.62 billion beat estimates for $13.11 billion.\nPlus, the company is planning to spend more on artificial intelligence. In February, it planned to invest $75 in capex for AI. But that was increased last night to $85 billion thanks to growing demand for Cloud products and services.\nUnfortunately, Tesla made a mess.\nDown about 6%, or $21 a share in premarket, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) posted its worst quarterly sales decline in years. Revenue dropped 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion, with analysts looking for $$22.74 billion. EPS of 40 cents also came in below estimates of 43 cents. Not helping, Musk did mention the company could have a rough few quarters ahead as a result of expiring federal electric vehicle tax credits.\nAnalysts are a bit mixed with responses.\nWells Fargo sees further downside, dropping their price target to $120 a share. The firm is also cautious on robotaxis and the Optimus humanoid, fearing that both could take longer than expected. However, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target to $300 from $285. The firm expects Tesla\u2019s revenue growth and profits to improve in 2026\nAdvertisement\nPresident Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell are on deck, too.\nFor the first time in nearly two decades, a president will visit the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cAmerican presidents have traditionally respected the independence of the central bank, which is insulated both in law and in practice from the political whims of elected officials,\u201d reported CNBC. \u201cTrump\u2019s visit is a remarkable symbolic move on that independence, bringing his drumbeat of criticism over Powell\u2019s refusal to lower interest rates right to the chairman\u2019s doorstep.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens.\nPresident Trump is expected to visit the Federal Reserve at 4 pm EST.\nIf You have $500,000 Saved, Retirement Could Be Closer Than You Think (sponsor)\nRetirement can be daunting, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.\nImagine having an expert in your corner to help you with your financial goals.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) climbed to 46,247.29, up 0.65% on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) reached 22,484.07, adding 0.44%. These levels represent an extraordinary rally driven by artificial intelligence, consumer resilience, and household equity exposure, but they also highlight risks as valuations stretch. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 sits at 22x, trailing P/E at 28x, and the CAPE ratio at 40x, a level unseen since the 2000 dot-com bubble. Investors are betting heavily on sustained earnings growth over the next decade, but these valuations leave little margin for error.\nArtificial Intelligence Spending Spree Pushes Nasdaq Higher\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s relentless climb is being powered by multi-hundred-billion-dollar AI infrastructure commitments. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged after pledging a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which itself sealed a $300 billion agreement with Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) under the Stargate program. CoreWeave\u2019s contracts swelled to $22.4 billion, nearly doubling from earlier commitments. This comes on top of Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ: AVGO) $10 billion customer deal, which analysts also tie back to OpenAI. Nvidia is effectively financing its own revenue growth \u2014 a system where capital inflows also return as GPU sales revenue. NVDA stock advanced more than 4% last week, and year-to-date it remains the dominant force behind tech\u2019s performance. Still, skeptics warn that this cycle resembles vendor financing during the dot-com era, raising concerns of a fragile foundation beneath the AI boom.\nHouseholds\u2019 Record Exposure to Equities Could Amplify Any Downturn\nFederal Reserve data shows that stocks now account for 45% of U.S. households\u2019 financial assets, surpassing the late-1990s peak just before the dot-com bust. The S&P 500\u2019s 33% rebound since April 8 has inflated personal balance sheets, but it has also concentrated household wealth in a single asset class. The Magnificent Seven \u2014 NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, META, GOOG, TSLA \u2014 now control 34% of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, contributing about 41% of its gains this year. While this concentration magnifies upside potential, it also raises systemic risks: if even two or three of these giants stumble, index-level downside could be severe.\nMacro Catalysts: September Jobs Report and Federal Reserve Outlook\nThe September U.S. employment report, due Friday, will be the week\u2019s pivotal release. August added just 22,000 jobs, the weakest monthly gain of the year, while unemployment edged higher. Inflation remains sticky, with the core PCE price index up 2.9% year-over-year in August, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Jerome Powell described the policy backdrop as \u201cchallenging,\u201d caught between rising unemployment and lingering inflation pressure. Treasury yields softened last week, fueling equity gains, but traders will be closely watching Fed speakers including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack for policy signals. A weak jobs print could accelerate expectations of further rate cuts, but it also risks raising recession fears.\nRead More\n-\nIYRI ETF Secures $50.24 Price With 8.7% Yield as Fed Rate Cuts Revive Real Estate Income Play\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) Slides to $109,700 as Spot ETFs Shed $903M and Miner Reserves Decline\n28.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Sli"

                "body": "Chinese economic data continues to face intense scrutiny as September draws to a close. After a string of disappointing reports, industrial profit figures revived hopes that Beijing could achieve its 5% GDP growth target for 2025.\nIndustrial profit soared 20.4% year-on-year (YoY) in August after falling 1.5% in July. From January to August, industrial profit increased 0.9% YoY, down marginally from 1.7% in July. Manufacturers saw profits rise 7.4%, helping offset weakness in other sectors and driving the overall 0.9% gain.\nThe upswing in manufacturing sector profits came despite US tariffs hitting external demand. August\u2019s figures suggested that Beijing\u2019s efforts to combat price wars, overcapacity, and deflation are gaining traction.\nAugust\u2019s data came ahead of China\u2019s Golden Week holiday, which traders will monitor closely for travel and consumption trends.\nUS stock futures benefited from the upswing in Chinese industrial profits, which eased concerns of a further loss of momentum in China\u2019s economy. Rising profits could bolster the labor market, lift wages, and fuel domestic demand.\nUS stock futures posted solid gains in morning trading on Monday, September 29. The Dow Jones E-mini rose 76 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 58 points, and the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 13 points.\nUS stock futures extended their gains from Friday, September 26, as US inflation numbers bolstered expectations of an October Fed rate cut. The US Core PCE Price Index increased 2.9% year-on-year in August, matching July\u2019s pace.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a 25-basis-point October rate cut rose from 87.7% on September 26 to 89.3% in early trading. 10-year US Treasury yields fell in early trading, while gold climbed 0.7% to $3,785, reflecting expectations of further Fed policy easing.\nStill, optimism hinges on whether policymakers reinforce these expectations. Fed commentary later in the day could prove pivotal.\nFed Vice-Chair John Williams and FOMC members Beth Hammack, Alberto Musalem, and Christopher Waller are due to speak today.\nSupport for an October rate cut could lift sentiment, while hawkish rhetoric may weigh on US stock futures.\nThe Kobeissi Letter contrasted central bank monetary policy decisions in the last 12 months with previous easing cycles, stating:\n\u201cThe global pivot: World central banks have cut rates 168 times over the last 12 months, the 3rd highest reading this century. The previous cycle peak was 196 cumulative 12-month rate reductions in June 2020. By comparison, following the 2008 Financial Crisis, global central banks cut rates as many as 249 times in the 12 months ending October 2009.\u201d\nCommenting on the Fed\u2019s policy pivot, The Kobeissi Letter added:\n\u201cWhile the US Fed was one of the last to join the rate cut cycle, two more rate cuts are expected by year-end. The Fed is joining the pivot in global monetary policy.\u201d\nThe impact of the Fed pivot on US stock futures will hinge on the US economy. A US recession could send US stock futures crashing, while a soft landing may fuel the rally.\nFollowing the morning gains, US stock futures traded comfortably above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), reaffirming a short-term bullish bias.\nHowever, the near-term outlook hinges on trade developments, Chinese economic data, the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy stance, FOMC members\u2019 speeches, and upcoming US labor market data. Key levels traders are monitoring include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nBeyond chart dynamics, broader catalysts loom large, making this week particularly crucial for influencing sentiment heading into Q4.\nTraders should closely monitor Bank of Japan commentary and USD/JPY trends. A hawkish BoJ and dovish Fed could trigger a yen carry trade unwind, affecting risk assets. However, China\u2019s private sector PMIs (September 30), trade developments, and US labor market data will also influence sentiment.\nUpbeat Chinese data, easing US-China trade tensions, and dovish Fed rhetoric could boos"

                "body": "Authorities investigate possible Russian \"hybrid warfare\" after oil tanker cuts undersea cables\nLate last year, Finnish special forces seized control of the Eagle S, a Russian shadow fleet oil tanker, after it dragged its anchor and severed critical undersea cables. The maneuver \u2014 what would later be described as a \"turning point\" \u2014 was the first time Finnish forces had boarded and seized any foreign ship since World War II.\nA seven-month long 60 Minutes investigation revealed that the Eagle S incident was not an isolated case. Authorities suspect Russian aggression aimed at undersea infrastructure, prompting NATO to launch \"Baltic Sentry,\" deploying ships and planes to monitor the shadow fleet and safeguard critical seabed infrastructure. British Adm. Keith Blount, NATO's deputy supreme allied commander Europe, said the Eagle S incident was a provocation that demanded a response.\n\"We're not going to be pushed around, interfered with,\" Blount said. \"We're not going to be subject to illegal behaviors that either threaten the rule of law, or worse, threaten the safety and security of our people.\"\nChristmas Day 2024\nThe Eagle S, loaded with Russian gas and en route to Egypt, triggered a nationwide alarm in Finland on Christmas last year. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo was celebrating with his family when an urgent call from Finland's Border Guard shattered the holiday calm.\nA critical undersea electric cable, Estlink-2, had been severely damaged 50 miles off the Finnish coast. Because there had been five other recent suspicious cable and gas line breaks, the Border Guard told the Prime Minister they suspected Estlink-2 was deliberately severed by a ship.\nWith the Eagle S near Finnish territorial waters, Prime Minister Orpo authorized the extraordinary step of moving to intercept the tanker. As the Coast Guard vessel Turva sped toward the Eagle S, police and Finland's National Bureau of Investigation monitored from shore.\nHelsinki Police Chief Jari Liukku said the Coast Guard radioed the Eagle S, asking if its anchors were up and secure. They were told \"Yes sir, our anchors are secured.\" But three hours later, as the Turva closed in, the crew could see that was not true. The anchor chain was hanging in the water.\n\"We had a strong reason to believe that it was an intentional activity from their side,\" Liukku said.\nJust after midnight, as the ship entered Finnish waters, Finland dispatched an armed team of special forces to the Eagle S by helicopter. They dropped onto the vessel in the dark and seized control from about two dozen crewmen from the countries of Georgia and India.\nIncrease in undersea cable cuts raises alarm\nIn the past two years, at least 11 cables, including a gas pipeline, have been cut in the Baltic, according to Finnish police, primarily in the waters off Finland, which shares an 832-mile border with Russia's west. Undersea cables carry the lifeblood of modern existence: electricity, gas, digital communications, global banking and the internet.\nIf the next cable in the Eagle S's path had been severed late last year, it could have stressed Estonia's electricity and gas supply, according to Risto Lohi, who oversaw the Eagle S case for Finland's National Bureau of Investigation.\n\"There was imminent threat that other critical infrastructure between Finland [and] Estonia would be damaged,\" Lohi said.\nFinnish investigators determined that the Eagle S raked its anchor across the sea bottom for more than six hours. When the ship was ordered to haul it up, the anchor was so battered, it snapped off the chain. Investigators found the anchor and the drag mark on the seabed. The drag mark, starting from the first damaged cable, was continuous until the location where the Eagle S was stopped, Lohi said. The anchor was dragged for about 66 miles.\nPolice handed their evidence to Finnish prosecutors, who charged the captain and two senior officers of the Eagle S with aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference w"

                "body": "RFK Jr.\u2019s Obsession With the Past\nA conversation with Elizabeth Bruenig about the MAHA movement\u2019s ideological underpinnings\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\nThe ascent of MAHA\u2014the Trump administration\u2019s movement to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d\u2014is part of a broader health revolution in the United States, one that venerates the past in order to carve out a purportedly healthier future. It has had mixed results; some MAHA tenets have little basis in medical literature (researchers pushed back on the White House\u2019s announcement this week that Tylenol use during pregnancy could be linked to autism). In today\u2019s Daily, my colleague Elizabeth Bruenig joins me for a conversation about her new article, \u201cWhen Child Death Was Everywhere,\u201d and the philosophy of the man behind the movement, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nWill Gottsegen: How does the ideology of conservatism explain what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is trying to do with health policy?\nElizabeth Bruenig: When you think of conservatism, you\u2019re thinking basically of someone who wants to conserve. William F. Buckley Jr. said the conservative disposition \u201cstands athwart history, yelling Stop.\u201d I think that helps explain why RFK Jr., who was a lifelong liberal, wound up on the conservative side of things. He, like a lot of conservatives, feels that the answer to human health and happiness lies somewhere in the past. It\u2019s a kind of nostalgia that drives what he\u2019s doing.\nWill: Wasn\u2019t that nostalgia for a supposedly healthier time once the province of the left?\nLiz: Vaccine skepticism was for a long time associated with the left, because it was associated with people who were skeptical of Western medicine or had a kind of \u201cback to the earth\u201d belief system that advocated holistic treatments and rejected modern pharmacology. Over time, anti-vax sentiment became more bipartisan, and then, after COVID, it just exploded on the right without exploding on the left.\nWill: Americans\u2019 trust in institutions such as HHS and the CDC declined majorly after COVID, on the right and the left. Is that how you wind up with someone as skeptical of the medical establishment as RFK Jr.?\nLiz: I think it\u2019s how you wind up with so many people who are interested in RFK Jr.\u2019s message. RFK Jr. was already anti-vax by the time the pandemic came around, but what COVID changed is it created so many people who had serious doubts about our institutions. And I think that explains why you have so many people at this point who are willing to listen to an anti-vax message.\nWill: You describe a lot of what RFK Jr. is doing as an unwinding of old policies, or a vision of return to an earlier era. What are the wrongs he\u2019s looking to right? And is there a way in which he\u2019s reacting to specific policies?\nLiz: RFK Jr., if you look at his career, is someone who has focused on the purity of nature: protecting the purity of natural resources, clean water, protecting pristine natural sites from industrial pollution. So I think his view on vaccines and processed foods is all of a piece with everything else he\u2019s done to try to keep things pure and natural. I do think that he is responding to the CDC\u2019s actions during COVID. A lot of people wound up very disillusioned with the lockdowns, with the mask mandates, and so on. And RFK Jr. is very much capitalizing on that mistrust people developed of the CDC.\nWill: To what extent is this broad skepticism now self-sustaining? Will we even need RFK Jr. to keep the wheels turning?\nLiz: I\u2019m afraid that we won\u2019t. At this point, it\u2019s become part of the belief system of the right, especially the MAGA right\u2014just like how post\u2013Donald Trump, we\u2019ll still be dealing in some sense with the MAGA movement, because it\u2019s changed how conservatives think about politics. We will still see right-wing anti-vax sentiment even afte"

The main trigger: many firms went ex-dividend, meaning new buyers no longer qualify for upcoming payouts\u2014often leading to share price dips. On top of that, the yen strengthened during the session, putting pressure on exporters\u2019 profit prospects. Only 22 stocks rose in the Nikkei 225, with heavyweights Komatsu and Honda Motor dropping more than 4%. Still, some standouts defied the gloom: Sumco soared 7.8%, M3 climbed 7.5%, and Advantest jumped 3.5%. Sony Financial made a splashy debut, rising as much as 40% after spinning off from Sony Group, which eked out a 0.2% gain.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Japan\u2019s rally gets a healthy reality check.\nEven with this step back, Japan\u2019s stock market has been one of the world\u2019s breakout performers this year, finally snapping out of decades-long stagnation. Swings around ex-dividend dates and currency moves are common, and strategists at firms like Nomura see these setbacks as natural pauses rather than red flags. Investors are closely monitoring whether bullish momentum will return, as global attention stays glued to Japan\u2019s recovery story.\nThe bigger picture: Global eyes are still fixed on Japan.\nJapan\u2019s resurgence has put it back in the global spotlight, with ongoing reforms and strong corporate earnings drawing renewed foreign investment. But this week\u2019s wobbles, driven by currency shifts and profit-taking, are a reminder that the climb won\u2019t be linear. As the yen responds quickly to global rate changes, Japan\u2019s performance will remain closely tied to the wider macro picture.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
