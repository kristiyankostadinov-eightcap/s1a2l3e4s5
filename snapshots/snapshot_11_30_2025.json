The materials group \u2013 home to many of the country\u2019s metal miners \u2013 jumped 2.1%, helped by gold\u2019s 1.8% rise as traders grew more confident that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Silver stole the show, leaping 6.1% to an all-time high, and a portfolio manager at First Avenue Investment Counsel said the backdrop looks \u201cquite supportive\u201d for the metal heading into 2026, pointing to the very strong inverse relationship between interest rates and gold. That optimism flowed straight into miners\u2019 shares: Endeavour Silver surged 12.7% and Aya Gold & Silver climbed 12%. Energy stocks also added 1.1% even as oil dipped 0.2% to $58.55 a barrel, meaning the sector still outperformed despite softer crude prices.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Canada\u2019s rally is leaning on old-school sectors.\nThe TSX is now up 3.7% for the month, riding its longest winning streak since 2021, and the leadership is coming from traditional Canadian powerhouses like miners and oil companies. That mix is getting a macro tailwind: Canada\u2019s annualized GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, trouncing the 0.5% economists expected, thanks largely to crude exports and government spending. At the same time, weak business investment and household consumption suggest growth is uneven \u2013 which could keep central banks cautious and interest rate expectations jumpy. With financials making up about a third of the TSX, upcoming quarterly results from the big banks could either extend this record-setting run or cool the momentum, especially if credit quality or loan demand disappoint. For now, First Avenue\u2019s view that provisions for credit losses and net interest margins remain healthy is helping keep sentiment toward Canadian equities upbeat.\nThe bigger picture: Lower rates could keep precious metals on center stage.\nGold and silver\u2019s jump reflects a broader macro story: when investors expect rate cuts, they often pivot toward assets that don\u2019t pay interest but can hold value if inflation stays sticky or growth slows. Because gold and real interest rates tend to move in opposite directions, the growing conviction that the Fed will trim borrowing costs into 2026 is a strong tailwind for bullion and related mining stocks. Silver\u2019s record-setting move \u2013 and double-digit gains in names like Endeavour Silver and Aya Gold & Silver \u2013 shows how quickly that theme can filter into equity prices. If global growth remains patchy, with export-heavy economies like Canada propped up by commodities while consumers and businesses stay cautious, markets could keep rewarding sectors tied to precious metals and energy. That would leave the TSX relatively well-positioned next to indexes that lean more heavily on high-growth tech.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Silver has support at Rs 1,60,950-Rs 1,59,400 per kg while resistance at Rs 1,63,850-1,64,900.\nAnalysts forecasted the current softness in bullion to continue in the near term, until there is a renewed surge in safe haven buying or a clear shift in the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy tone.\nBank of America earlier this week said that gold could touch $5,000 with macro tail winds such as elevated government debt levels, persistent inflation, lower interest rates, and unconventional US economic policies.\nThey noted that institutional allocations remain relatively light even as prices climb.\nSlowing demand from China, supply constraints in key mined metals and low global inventories are other key watch points, according to the bank."

Early reports suggest the group will stick to a pause in the rollback of its cuts. Yet commentators say that this will not be enough\u2014a glut is coming and OPEC+ will need something more than pausing cuts.\nFirst, the numbers. OPEC and its partners from OPEC+ started cutting oil production in 2023 after prices fell from three-digit highs in 2022. At the peak of the cuts, the group was withholding over 5 million barrels daily in supply. In fact, it was withholding close to 6 million barrels daily: the initial OPEC+ cuts of 2 million barrels daily, the first round of voluntary cuts by eight members of the group, amounting to 1.65 million barrels daily, and the second round of voluntary cuts by the same eight members, at 2.2 million barrels daily.\nOf these, the original cuts remain in place and will remain there until the end of next year. Of the two rounds of voluntary cuts, 2.2 million barrels daily have been unwound, as well as 411,000 barrels daily from the first round of those cuts. This leaves some 3.24 million barrels daily in withheld supply, per Reuters calculations. Apparently, the amount is not enough to calm markets in their anticipation of a glut.\nRelated: Germany Seeks Looser EU Rules of Gasoline Cars Phase-out by 2035\nNot that forecasters are helping. The perception of a glut is already so pervasive that there seems to be few who question it. Not only this, but the glut keeps getting revised higher and higher. Per the International Energy Agency\u2019s latest, the supply overhang in crude oil could top the record-smashing 4 million barrels daily next year\u2014even though the IEA has revised its demand estimates higher. Per JP Morgan, the glut will not only be severe, but it would linger, pressuring prices a lot lower than they already are.\nWhile forecasters and analysts talk about the glut, OPEC is preparing to discuss its maximum sustainable production capacity. That capacity needs to be measured so the group can set its baseline for 2027, Reuters reported, citing two OPEC delegates. Over the past two years, some members have found it hard to produce in line with their quotas\u2014which were established on baselines\u2014while others have taken the opportunity to produce more than their quotas.\nIraq and Russia, for instance, have found it difficult to stick to their target production levels. The United Arab Emirates, on the other hand, even managed to get a quota increase from the producer group, to reflect\u2014and legitimize\u2014its higher production capacity. Saudi Arabia, according to Reuters, has also benefited from greater production capacity.\nYet updating production baselines is just one of the things OPEC can do next year to get a clearer picture of how much each member of the group is actually producing. Another thing that the cartel can, and should, do is clean up its production data, at least according to Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas.\nIn a column this week, Blas said OPEC+ intentionally misleads the market with inaccurate data\u2014both self-reported and secondary-source, after the secondary sources were asked to change their production calculation methodology, per Blas. Also, OPEC+ needs to start reporting condensate and natural gas liquids production alongside crude, the Bloomberg energy columnist argued, noting that last year, in addition to the 40.9 million bpd in pure crude, as it were, OPEC+ was also producing 8.5 million bpd of condensates and NGLs.\nWhile OPEC+ discusses how to move forward, oil prices are on course to end 2025 with a solid decline, largely on the back of those oversupply expectations based on global oil inventories, the prospect of an end to the war in Ukraine, and, of course, the oil demand decline narrative that focuses on China and its demand growth moderation.\nOPEC itself sees the oil market balanced in 2026. In fact, it berated the media for its misrepresentation of its latest Monthly Oil Market Report, because some cove"

Brent crude closed on Friday near $63 a barrel, down 15% this year. On Sunday, eight OPEC countries are likely to keep their policy to pause oil output hikes in the first quarter of 2026 unchanged, the three delegates said, following similar comments from others this week. They agreed the pause at their last meeting earlier in November.\nOPEC , which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps about half the world's oil and has been discussing for years production capacity figures against which members' output targets are set.\nIn a separate meeting on Sunday, the full OPEC group is expected to agree on a mechanism to assess members' maximum production capacity, sources told Reuters this week. OPEC said in May this capacity assessment would be used as a reference for 2027 output baselines.\nA series of online meetings is scheduled to begin at 1300 GMT on Sunday. OPEC ministers are also expected to not make any changes to group-wide production targets for 2026, other sources said this week.\nOPEC had been curtailing supplies for years until April when the eight members began to raise production to recover market share. The cuts had peaked in March, amounting to 5.85 million barrels per day, almost 6% of world output, in total.\nThe eight - Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria and Oman - have raised output targets by around 2.9 million bpd from April to December.

                "body": "As the global energy landscape evolves, the oil market in 2026 is anticipated to experience significant changes, with analysts predicting a substantial surplus. This oversupply is expected to exert downward pressure on oil prices, challenging the stability of markets worldwide. While U.S. crude is projected to average $59.00 per barrel, slightly below previous estimates, geopolitical risks and strategic decisions by major oil producers could play a pivotal role in shaping future price trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders across the energy sector, as the interplay between supply, demand, and political factors will dictate market conditions.\nProjected Oil Surplus and Its Implications\nAnalysts are forecasting an unprecedented global oil surplus for 2026, with estimates ranging from 0.5 to 4.2 million barrels per day. This marks a significant increase from the previous year\u2019s projections of 0.19 to 3.0 million barrels per day. The International Energy Agency anticipates a market surplus of 4.09 million barrels per day, underscoring the potential for substantial excess supply. Meanwhile, OPEC\u2019s recent reports suggest a more modest surplus of 20,000 barrels per day if current production levels persist.\nSuch an oversupply could have far-reaching consequences for global markets. While lower prices might benefit consumers and industries reliant on oil, they could also pose challenges for oil-producing nations whose economies depend heavily on oil revenues. This dynamic creates a complex landscape where producers must carefully balance output to avoid exacerbating the surplus while meeting economic needs.\nUS Drillers Boost Oil and Gas Rigs Again, Signaling a Shift in Energy Landscape Amid Global Demand\nOPEC+ Strategies Amidst Oversupply Concerns\nOPEC+ has played a central role in managing oil supply, having increased output targets by approximately 2.9 million barrels per day since April. Despite this, the group plans to pause production hikes in the first quarter of 2026, with Brent crude expected to average $61.23 during that period. The prevailing sentiment among poll participants is that OPEC+ will refrain from aggressive production increases in light of ongoing oversupply concerns.\nKim Fustier, head of European oil & gas research at HSBC, expressed skepticism about OPEC+ reversing its current course and cutting production again. The group is likely to consider such measures only if Brent prices remain below $55 per barrel for an extended period. This cautious approach reflects the complexity of balancing market stability with the economic needs of member countries.\nImpact of Geopolitical Risks and Sanctions\nGeopolitical factors continue to influence oil markets, with U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2019s leading oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, posing potential supply disruptions. However, analysts believe these disruptions will be short-lived, as Russian barrels are expected to re-enter markets through shadow fleets and intermediaries. Additionally, peace talks could facilitate the return of more oil to the market, further intensifying supply pressures.\nMatthew Sherwood, lead commodities analyst at EIU, suggests that declining U.S. shale output, coupled with geopolitical risks, will help maintain a price floor around $60 per barrel. This interplay between supply dynamics and political factors highlights the complexity of predicting future market trends, emphasizing the need for stakeholders to remain vigilant and adaptive.\nUS Oil and Gas Rig Count Declines, Raising Questions About Future Amid Record Production Levels\nBalancing Demand Growth and Supply Dynamics\nGlobal oil demand is projected to grow by 0.5 to 1.2 million barrels per day in 2026. This modest increase in demand must be balanced against the anticipated surplus to stabilize markets. While the demand growth offers some relief to oversupply concerns, it is insufficient to fully absorb the excess production projected for the year.\nEfforts to balance sup"

                "body": "Exxon and Chevron hike oil production despite global glut and see more \u2018frontier exploration\u2019 as U.S. shale boom slows\nBig Oil leaders Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Shell continue to hike their crude oil production volumes from West Texas\u2019s Permian Basin to the Gulf of Mexico to deepwater Guyana despite concerns of a rising global oil glut as OPEC nations keep exporting more barrels each month.\nThe production increases threaten to further exacerbate a weaker oil price environment predicted to go lower heading into 2026 with the U.S. benchmark hovering near the $60-per-barrel threshold below which companies struggle to maintain profitability. But the biggest players have more scale to remain undeterred by lower commodity prices.\nFor the two largest American players, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, primary growth remains in the still-booming Permian where Exxon churned out a record high of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, including natural gas volumes. Chevron is the only other company to exceed the seven-figure mark there, coming in at 1.06 million barrels daily.\n\u201cWe set yet another production record,\u201d said Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods during the third-quarter earnings call on Friday. \u201cOur Permian production continues to grow well into the next decade. It clearly differentiates us from our competitors, who are talking about reduced investments, peak production, or a shift to harvest mode.\u201d\nExxon\u2019s global volumes grew from 4.63 million barrels of oil equivalent daily in the second quarter to 4.77 barrels a day in the third. Exxon even aims to hit 5.4 million barrels by 2030, driven mostly by the Permian and its pioneering offshore Guyana development.\nChevron\u2019s biggest growth area was the Permian, too, without even trying. Chevron is actively cutting its Permian capital expenditure to save money and keep production there plateaued to 1 million barrels daily. But Chevron still gained almost 60,000 barrels daily from the second quarter.\n\u201cIt really highlights the efficiency gains. The production is an outcome there,\u201d said Chevron chairman and CEO Mike Wirth on his Friday earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to continue to deliver strong performance with fewer [drilling] rigs and fewer completions spreads. We expect to move into 2026 with good momentum.\u201d\nThe strong momentum is expected to run into pricing headwinds as OPEC\u2014led by Saudi Arabia\u2014continues to unwind years of production cuts that kept pricing higher to regain market share and, in an unspoken added benefit, appease President Trump and his outspoken desire for lower prices at the pump.\n\u201cWhat we see at the moment is indeed headwinds on the supply-demand fundamentals going into 2026 and a highly credible scenario that there is an oversupply in 2026,\u201d said Shell CEO Wael Sawan. \u201cI think in the short to medium term, there are headwinds. Longer term, we continue to have strong conviction in crude prices going forward.\u201d\nStubbornly high, world-leading, record U.S. oil production of more than 13.6 million barrels of oil per day isn\u2019t helping. Prices fell, but U.S. volumes plateaued\u2014and even increased a bit\u2014rather than going down. That could change in the next calendar year with reduced well-drilling activities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe don\u2019t whipsaw much on near-term commodity and market dynamics,\u201d Wirth said of Chevron. \u201cSmaller operators may not be in the same balance sheet position, and may have other financial constraints. They may operate differently.\u201d\nReturn to exploration\nDespite the strong volumes, the 20-year-old U.S. shale boom is maturing, and companies recognize onshore U.S. oilfields may not serve as their piggybanks for decades to come.\nThat is why, after years of contracted exploration spending to focus on American shale plays, Big Oil producers are beginning to dedicate more dollars to international offshore exploration again in South America, Africa, and other frontiers. That is especially true because U.S. shale wells tend to dry up more quickly"

                "body": "As the global energy landscape evolves, the oil market in 2026 is anticipated to experience significant changes, with analysts predicting a substantial surplus. This oversupply is expected to exert downward pressure on oil prices, challenging the stability of markets worldwide. While U.S. crude is projected to average $59.00 per barrel, slightly below previous estimates, geopolitical risks and strategic decisions by major oil producers could play a pivotal role in shaping future price trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders across the energy sector, as the interplay between supply, demand, and political factors will dictate market conditions.\nProjected Oil Surplus and Its Implications\nAnalysts are forecasting an unprecedented global oil surplus for 2026, with estimates ranging from 0.5 to 4.2 million barrels per day. This marks a significant increase from the previous year\u2019s projections of 0.19 to 3.0 million barrels per day. The International Energy Agency anticipates a market surplus of 4.09 million barrels per day, underscoring the potential for substantial excess supply. Meanwhile, OPEC\u2019s recent reports suggest a more modest surplus of 20,000 barrels per day if current production levels persist.\nSuch an oversupply could have far-reaching consequences for global markets. While lower prices might benefit consumers and industries reliant on oil, they could also pose challenges for oil-producing nations whose economies depend heavily on oil revenues. This dynamic creates a complex landscape where producers must carefully balance output to avoid exacerbating the surplus while meeting economic needs.\nUS Drillers Boost Oil and Gas Rigs Again, Signaling a Shift in Energy Landscape Amid Global Demand\nOPEC+ Strategies Amidst Oversupply Concerns\nOPEC+ has played a central role in managing oil supply, having increased output targets by approximately 2.9 million barrels per day since April. Despite this, the group plans to pause production hikes in the first quarter of 2026, with Brent crude expected to average $61.23 during that period. The prevailing sentiment among poll participants is that OPEC+ will refrain from aggressive production increases in light of ongoing oversupply concerns.\nKim Fustier, head of European oil & gas research at HSBC, expressed skepticism about OPEC+ reversing its current course and cutting production again. The group is likely to consider such measures only if Brent prices remain below $55 per barrel for an extended period. This cautious approach reflects the complexity of balancing market stability with the economic needs of member countries.\nImpact of Geopolitical Risks and Sanctions\nGeopolitical factors continue to influence oil markets, with U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2019s leading oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, posing potential supply disruptions. However, analysts believe these disruptions will be short-lived, as Russian barrels are expected to re-enter markets through shadow fleets and intermediaries. Additionally, peace talks could facilitate the return of more oil to the market, further intensifying supply pressures.\nMatthew Sherwood, lead commodities analyst at EIU, suggests that declining U.S. shale output, coupled with geopolitical risks, will help maintain a price floor around $60 per barrel. This interplay between supply dynamics and political factors highlights the complexity of predicting future market trends, emphasizing the need for stakeholders to remain vigilant and adaptive.\nUS Oil and Gas Rig Count Declines, Raising Questions About Future Amid Record Production Levels\nBalancing Demand Growth and Supply Dynamics\nGlobal oil demand is projected to grow by 0.5 to 1.2 million barrels per day in 2026. This modest increase in demand must be balanced against the anticipated surplus to stabilize markets. While the demand growth offers some relief to oversupply concerns, it is insufficient to fully absorb the excess production projected for the year.\nEfforts to balance sup"

The move follows renewed weakness in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which slipped to 99.44 as traders boosted expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut at the December FOMC meeting. Fed officials John Williams and Christopher Waller reinforced this dovish stance, pushing rate-cut odds to 87% according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThis repricing of US policy has widened the yield gap between Europe and the U.S., strengthening the euro. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent comments emphasize risk management over inflation fighting, contrasting with the European Central Bank (ECB), which signals a pause but not yet a reversal of its tightening path.\nGerman CPI Surprise Reinforces Euro Resilience Amid Dollar Weakness\nGermany\u2019s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for November rose 2.6% year-over-year, exceeding the consensus of 2.4%, marking a significant uptick from 2.3% in October. Meanwhile, French GDP grew 0.1% QoQ, and Spain\u2019s inflation hit 3.1%, slightly above estimates. These readings suggest that European inflation remains persistent, making the ECB less inclined to ease aggressively in early 2026.\nThe divergence in inflation trajectories between Europe and the U.S. \u2014 with the core PCE index in the U.S. dropping to 3.5%, a two-year low \u2014 has been pivotal for EUR/USD momentum.

Key resistance stands at 1.1650, followed by the 1.1700 handle, a level aligned with the October highs. On the downside, immediate support sits at 1.1550, followed by 1.1500 and 1.1468 \u2014 the early November swing low.\nA daily close above 1.1620\u20131.1643 (50/100-day SMA cluster) would confirm continuation toward 1.17, with potential acceleration if US yields continue to retreat below 4.1% on the 10-year Treasury.\nMarket Positioning and Volatility Trends\nImplied volatility for EUR/USD rose to 7.5%, reflecting heightened uncertainty ahead of upcoming U.S. ISM, ADP employment, and inflation reports. Trading volumes remain subdued following the Thanksgiving holiday, but institutional flows suggest accumulation of euro positions. Option traders favor short-dated EUR/USD calls targeting 1.1650\u20131.17, reflecting confidence in near-term bullish momentum.\nMeanwhile, large speculative positions in CFTC data indicate euro longs expanded by 18,000 contracts last week \u2014 the largest build since August \u2014 signaling renewed conviction that the dollar\u2019s cyclical strength is fading.\nRead More\n-\nPFFA ETF Nears $21.50 as Rate Cuts and 9.49% Yield Spark Renewed Demand\n29.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI and XRPR ETFs Ignite Ripple\u2019s Institutional Rally as Inflows Near $1B and XRP Holds $2.20\n29.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - NG=F Blasts to $4.85 as Demand Surge Fuel Multi-Month Breakout\n29.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen to Dollar Slides to 156.10 as Yen Strengthens on Fed Cut Expectations\n29.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMacro Divergence: Fed Easing Path vs. ECB Pause Supports the Euro\nMarkets now price in three Fed rate cuts by mid-2026, while the ECB\u2019s tightening cycle appears complete but with no imminent easing.

The pound\u2019s performance has been buoyed by a mix of domestic fiscal reassurance, improving investor sentiment post-budget, and fading U.S. dollar strength ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting. As of late London trading, GBP/USD trades near 1.3240, up 0.32% on the day, having posted five consecutive daily gains, its longest winning streak since September. The currency pair\u2019s near-term trajectory now hinges on the interplay between the Bank of England\u2019s cautious policy stance and growing conviction that the Fed will deliver another rate cut in two weeks.\nSterling Builds on Fiscal Optimism as UK Budget and Bond Stability Support Demand\nThe rally in the pound began immediately following the UK Chancellor\u2019s budget presentation, which stabilized gilt markets and restored confidence in Britain\u2019s fiscal outlook. The GBP/USD pair briefly hit a four-week high of 1.3260 before settling around 1.3220. The market interpreted the government\u2019s balanced tone\u2014avoiding both austerity and excessive spending\u2014as a signal of fiscal prudence, which reduced pressure on the Bank of England to act aggressively.\nUK bond yields remained steady, and foreign investors returned to gilts after months of capital outflows, reinforcing sterling\u2019s strength. According to Standard Chartered, these conditions have positioned GBP/USD to potentially advance toward 1.34 in December, contingent upon a dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve.\nFederal Reserve Dovish Turn Weakens USD and Fuels Pound Resilience\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s broad retreat has amplified GBP/USD\u2019s upside. The DXY index, which tracks the dollar against major peers, slipped below 100.20, losing nearly 1.4% over the week as traders priced in a near 75\u201380% probability of a December rate cut. Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams, have publicly endorsed further easing, citing softer inflation and weakening labor data. The October CPI print at 2.8% and non-farm payrolls rising just 155,000 reinforced expectations for a dovish policy shift.\nWhile the Fed\u2019s rate cuts are intended to cushion slowing growth, they are simultaneously eroding dollar yields\u2014pushing traders toward higher-yielding currencies like GBP. Historically, during similar easing cycles (2019 and 2023), the GBP/USD pair gained between 4\u20136% in the following month, suggesting potential continuation toward 1.3350\u20131.3400 in the near term if policy divergence widens further.\nBank of England Holds Line at 5.00% but December Cut Looms\nThe Bank of England remains cautious as inflation proves sticky, with October CPI at 4.1%, still double its 2% target. However, weak economic growth\u2014Q3 GDP at just 0.1% and the OBR slashing 2026 growth forecasts to 0.8%\u2014has intensified pressure for a rate reduction. Markets now price a 65% probability that the BoE will lower its policy rate to 3.75% at the December meeting.\nEven so, policymakers including Governor Andrew Bailey maintain a hawkish undertone, signaling that cuts will be \u201cgradual and conditional.\u201d This cautious posture has paradoxically benefited sterling, as investors see the BoE as slower to pivot than the Fed. The divergence reinforces medium-term support for GBP/USD above 1.3180, while the 1.3300 resistance remains the immediate test before the December central bank meetings.\nTechnical Analysis: Sterling\u2019s Bullish Structure Intact but Momentum Slows Near 1.3300\nThe GBP/USD daily chart shows a firm uptrend that began after the pair\u2019s "

This trajectory is driving renewed institutional and speculative interest in uranium stocks on the ASX. From prolonged bear market conditions in the early 2010s to a resurgence fueled by tightening supply and ambitious nuclear buildout plans\u2014investors are navigating an increasingly complex uranium equity landscape.\nStrategic scenario modeling enables market participants to assess the risk-return matrix across the spectrum of Australian-listed uranium companies. Furthermore, uranium market volatility continues to present both opportunities and challenges for investors. The distinction between producers, developers, and explorers has become critical amid shifting supply, policy, and demand scenarios.\nStrategic Investment Framework for Australian Uranium Equities\nThe Australian uranium equities sector can be classified into tiers reflecting maturity, market capitalisation, and risk:\nASX Uranium Sector Strategic Classification Matrix\nKey Considerations\n-\nAustralia hosts ~30% of global uranium reserves and is the world's third-largest producer, exporting over 7,000 tonnes annually (World Nuclear Association, 2024).\n-\nASX uranium companies move through a structured value chain, from resource identification under the JORC Code to feasibility, off-take arrangements, and eventual production.\n-\nCompanies with sizeable JORC-compliant resources and secured financing frequently advance to the Tier 1 category. In addition, this reflects both operational capability and lower risk.\n-\nISR uranium production has emerged as a capital-efficient, lower-impact approach. However, it is often favoured by developers and producers operating in suitable geological conditions.\nWhat Drives Institutional Interest in Australian Uranium Investments?\nInstitutional appetite for uranium stocks on the ASX stems from several strategic factors:\n-\nResource Sovereignty: Australia's robust, legally protected uranium resource base creates long-term supply security for nuclear utilities worldwide.\n-\nGeopolitical Stability: Exposure to ASX-listed uranium producers provides risk diversification from supply-dense but politically complex regions such as Kazakhstan or Central Asia.\n-\nESG and Decarbonisation: With nuclear energy included in Europe's green taxonomy and accepted in many ESG frameworks, uranium equities now attract a greater share of clean energy capital (Eurosif, 2024).\n-\nExport Infrastructure: Proximity and established agreements with key Asian nuclear nations (China, Japan, South Korea) reduce logistical costs and commercial risk.\n-\nRegulatory Certainty: Australia maintains transparent federal/state oversight and participates in over 40 international nuclear safeguards agreements. Consequently, this lowers operational risk for institutional capital.\nNotably, recent years have seen European pension plans and infrastructure funds increase uranium allocations to hedge against fossil fuel volatility and ensure exposure to baseload clean energy solutions.\nWhich ASX Uranium Companies Lead Production Capacity Scenarios?\nTier 1: Established Production Platforms\n-\nPaladin Energy (ASX: PDN)\n- Market Cap: ~AU$3.5-4.5B\n- The Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia is fully operational and ranks as one of the world's largest independent uranium producers. Targeting over 15 million pounds of uranium oxide per year, the operation benefits from low average ore grades (400\u2013600ppm) but significant throughput and a mature regulatory regime.\n- Historical and current cost structure positions Paladin as a low- to mid-cost producer (operating costs <US$25/lb at scale).\n-\nBoss Energy (ASX: BOE)\n- Market Cap: ~AU$1.6B\n- Focused on the Honeymoon ISR project in South Australia, targeting 2.45 million pounds per year by mid-2025. Previously operated between 2008 and 2013, Honeymoon's chemistry and wellfield design support rap"

Analysts and AI forecasts alike suggest that XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term XRP price predictions also place it as high as $26.50 by 2030, with an ultra-bullish target of $526 by 2050.\nRipple (XRP) remains one of the top five crypto assets in the world, gaining traction as institutional adoption ramps up and its prolonged legal battle approaches resolution. Since President Trump\u2019s return to office, XRP has seen a resurgence in on-chain activity, investor sentiment, and speculation around potential ETF approval.\nIn July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66, coinciding with the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF launch. As more asset managers have filed for the ETF approval race, the crypto community is now asking: How high can XRP go?\nXRP Price Today\nXRP Price Prediction December 2025\nThe recent XRP price action in the second half of the trading period has formed a falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential odds for a bullish reversal.\nSpecifically, the impressive 20% climb observed over the past week suggests that we witnessed a reversal from the retest of the lower boundary of this pattern.\nIf the price successfully breaks through this key pattern\u2019s upper border by the end of November, it could set the stage for a rally in December aimed at reclaiming the significant resistance level at $3.66.\nXRP Price Predictions for October 2025 by AI Platforms\nXRP Price Prediction 2025\nDuring the latter half of the year, the XRP/USD pair on Coinbase demonstrated remarkable price movements. A standout moment occurred in July when it surged to an impressive peak of $3.66. However, following this excitement, the price gradually retreated to around $1.80 by November.\nAs of late November, XRP/USD tested the vital $1.80 support level, showcasing encouraging signs of recovery with a notable 20% increase back above the $2 threshold. This brings us to an intriguing question: can this upward momentum be sustained, or are we witnessing a temporary rally within a broader downtrend?\nTo avoid a prolonged decline, XRP price analysis 2025 suggests that it must maintain stability above the key resistance levels of $2.40 to $2.50. Successfully breaking through these levels could set the stage for a rally toward its all-time high (ATH) before the year ends.\nConversely, if XRP price continues to follow the prevailing downtrend, there is a significant risk that it could experience another substantial decline in the final month of the year, potentially testing lower support levels and impacting overall market sentiment. The upcoming weeks will be crucial for investors and analysts alike to monitor the market dynamics surrounding XRP\u2019s performance.\nXRP Price Analysis 2025 : Onchain Outlook\nThe XRP Ledger: DEX Transaction Count chart indicates a significant bullish divergence starting from May 2025. While the price is consolidating, the activity in decentralised exchanges (DEX) is increasing sharply.\nThe high transaction volume, which includes both orders placed and cancelled, shows that experienced traders are actively positioning themselves and adding liquidity in anticipation of a future price movement.\nAs a result, this on-chain metric suggests that the market is preparing for a powerful and sustainable rally in the XRP price.\nRipple XRP Price Prediction 2026 \u2013 2030\nThis table, based on historical movements, shows XRP price prediction 2030 to reach $26.50 based on compounding market cap each year. This table provides a framework for understanding the potential XRP price movements.

                "body": "USD/JPY snaps a five-week run of new higher highs, as rising bets on a narrowing US-Japan rate differential favored the yen. US jobs data bolstered bets on a December Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, Japanese inflation and retail sales figures lifted expectations of a December BoJ rate hike.\nCrucially, the Fed-BoJ collision course raises the risk of a yen carry trade unwind, which would send USD/JPY sharply lower.\nIn July 2024, the BoJ cut purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5%. The decision coincided with rising bets on a Fed rate cut, triggering a yen carry trade unwind. The policy decision sent USD/JPY crashing from 155.216 to 139.576 before recovering.\nFast forward to December 2025, and the BoJ and the Fed\u2019s policy stances suggest a similar dynamic to Q3 2024, signaling a bearish short- to medium-term outlook.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, key economic indicators and Bank of Japan monetary policy cues will influence bets on a December rate hike. Key data includes capital spending, consumer confidence, and household spending.\nThe BoJ\u2019s increasing attention to wage growth will place a greater focus on capital spending trends on Monday, December 1. Economists forecast capital spending to rise 5.9% year-on-year in Q3, down from 7.6% in the previous quarter.\nWeaker capital spending would indicate softer business investment, potentially leading to job cuts and lower wages. A cooling labor market and softer wage growth typically affect household purchasing power and spending. A lower spending outlook dampens demand-driven inflationary pressures, supporting a less hawkish BoJ policy stance.\nA drop in capital spending would temporarily temper demand for the yen. However, updates from wage negotiations for 2026 and last week\u2019s Q4 economic indicators are likely to keep the hope of a rate hike alive. Given these dynamics, the short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY is bearish.\nGiven October\u2019s upswing in retail sales, consumer confidence figures on Tuesday, December 2, will require consideration. Consumer confidence data will provide insights into whether the economy has gained further momentum after contracting in Q3.\nEconomists expect consumer confidence to rise from 35.8 in October to 35.9 in November. Improving sentiment would support a positive outlook on private consumption, which accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP. Crucially, increased domestic demand pushes consumer prices higher, supporting tighter monetary policy.\nNotably, consumer confidence slumped from 34.1 in March to 31.2 in April, as President Trump\u2019s tariff policies hit sentiment. However, confidence has improved sharply in H2 2025. Crucially, Trump cut tariffs on Japanese goods from 25% to 15% in September, which should lift sentiment.\nA pickup in consumer confidence will likely boost demand for the yen, aligning with a bearish USD/JPY outlook.\nOn Friday, December 5, household spending figures will indicate whether lower tariffs and the upward trend in consumer confidence have translated into higher consumption.\nEconomists forecast household spending to rise 0.7% month-on-month in October, reversing a 0.7% drop in September. A rebound in spending would signal a pickup in economic momentum and potentially higher inflation. These dynamics would support a December BoJ rate hike, boosting demand for the Japanese yen.\nFor context, private consumption increased 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, after expanding 0.4% in Q2. Weaker consumption contributed to the 0.4% quarterly economic contraction.\nHowever, economists brushed aside the Q3 data, maintaining expectations of a near-term BoJ policy adjustment. According to November\u2019s Reuters poll, conducted between November 11 and 18:\nStronger consumer confidence and a recovery in household spending will reinforce confidence in a December hike.\nWith key economi"

The move marks the first sustained pullback since early October, when the pair surged to a 2025 peak of 158.21. Selling pressure intensified this week as U.S. yields fell below the critical 4.00% level on the 10-year Treasury, eroding the dollar\u2019s yield advantage. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows an 86.9% probability of a rate cut to 3.75%, a shift that has driven traders to unwind long-dollar positions, providing renewed momentum for the yen.\nRate Cut Expectations Shift Market Dynamics and Undermine Dollar Momentum\nRecent U.S. macro data reinforced the view that monetary tightening is ending. Core PPI rose only 0.1% versus the 0.2% forecast, while retail sales stagnated at 0.2%, well below the 0.4% consensus. These numbers signal fading inflation and slowing consumer activity, key catalysts that have pushed markets to price in a dovish Fed path. The DXY Index slid to 99.08, down from the 100.22 November resistance zone, showing the broad dollar weakening. Despite the Fed\u2019s ongoing caution in communication, traders have begun positioning for easing, compressing the U.S.-Japan yield differential that had supported USD/JPY throughout Q4.\nBOJ Policy Outlook: Ueda Speech Looms Over Short-Term Yen Direction\nAttention in Japan now centers on the upcoming Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda speech, which may provide forward guidance on rate normalization. After Tokyo\u2019s core CPI came in hotter than expected, at 2.8% YoY, speculation grew that the BOJ could raise rates by 25 basis points in December, its first move since 2007. Current JGB auction yields remain elevated, with the 10-year yield holding above 0.95%, signaling persistent market pressure for policy adjustment. Should Ueda hint at further tightening, yen strength could accelerate sharply, possibly driving USD/JPY toward the 153.00\u2013153.30 support range, its key equilibrium level for the quarter.\nU.S. Data Calendar: PMIs, Labor Market, and Core PCE Set to Drive Volatility\nThe upcoming U.S. calendar is loaded with data releases that could intensify volatility. Manufacturing and Services PMIs on Monday and Wednesday, Challenger layoffs, and weekly jobless claims on Thursday will shape the near-term policy outlook. On Friday, the core PCE deflator, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation metric, will likely determine the tone for rate expectations ahead of the December meeting. Historically, USD/JPY exhibits heightened sensitivity to labor and inflation prints, with intraday swings often exceeding 1.2% when data surprises deviate from consensus. If inflation cools further, traders could push yields even lower, reinforcing yen demand.\nTechnical Breakdown: Neutral Bias Builds as RSI and MACD Turn Lower\nThe USD/JPY daily chart shows a clear loss of upward momentum. After months of near-vertical gains, the pair finally breached its October uptrend line last Friday, breaking below the ascending channel that defined the Q4 rally. Momentum oscillators confirm the shift: the RSI (14) fell from 72 to 54, exiting overbought territory, while MACD histogram has flattened near zero, indicating a weakening bullish impulse. Price is now testing a dense support cluster between 155.73 and 155.00, with additional downside levels at 153.68 and 153.00. Resistance is capped at 157.90, followed by the yearly high of 158.21, which remains the technical trigger for any renewed bullish breakout.\nYen Sentiment and Global Yield Dynamics\nThe yen\u2019s rebound is driven not just by U.S. rate expectations but also by"

                "body": "Weekly Crypto Fundamental Outlook: Is Market Confidence Returning?\nCryptocurrencies have once again shown a notable buying bias over the past weeks of trading, achieving a short-term recovery as November comes to an end. Temporary buying pressure has remained firm as several events point toward a more dovish monetary policy in the United States, which has partially stabilized dollar movements and helped revive appetite for risk assets \u2014 such as the crypto market. If this perception of lower interest rates continues, it is possible that the buying pressure now forming in the crypto market could hold through the short term.\nIs Risk Appetite Returning?\nAlthough this week was not among the most volatile due to the U.S. holiday, it did leave behind several relevant developments tied to the Federal Reserve. The expectation that the institution may continue with interest rate cuts toward the end of 2025 has gained strength again. The CME Group probability model now shows an 86.9% probability that U.S. interest rates will be lowered by 0.25%, a significant increase compared to last week, when odds were still below 50%.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nIn part, the Federal Reserve\u2019s persistent indecision has started to reduce the appeal of safe-haven markets such as U.S. Treasury bonds and, simultaneously, the U.S. dollar, which showed slower movements throughout the week. Bond yields fell below the 4.00% reference zone, creating room for risk appetite to recover. This shift has benefited the crypto market, which had lost demand weeks ago. As safe-haven assets like bonds lose attractiveness, cryptocurrencies can receive capital flows seeking higher short-term returns.\nThis change in market perception is also reflected in the behavior of Bitcoin\u2019s Open Interest, which measures the total number of open positions in the market. The indicator has shown a steady recovery to 29.3 billion, alongside a rebound in BTC\u2019s price. This signals that selling positions have decreased while buying positions have increased consistently throughout the week.\nSource: Cryptoquant\nThus, the renewed expectation of lower rates for December appears to have supported the recovery in crypto appetite. If this outlook continues reducing the appeal of safe-haven assets and strengthening flows toward risk assets, the crypto market may maintain consistent buying pressure in the coming sessions.\nBitcoin Compared to Other Markets\nRecent movements in Bitcoin (BTC) have begun to show a positive correlation coefficient with other risk markets such as the SPX index, surpassing the neutral zone of 0 and reaching positive territory. This suggests that, to some extent, Bitcoin has started to replicate the upward movements seen in U.S. equity indices. However, it is important to keep in mind that this coefficient can change over time.\nThis phenomenon shows that as equity indices have recovered in the short term, Bitcoin \u2014the benchmark cryptocurrency\u2014 has displayed similar behavior. This aligns with the rebound in risk appetite across financial markets, benefiting both equities and crypto assets. With this in mind, if risk appetite continues to hold, the crypto market may continue to benefit. Still, key data from the Federal Reserve will be necessary to confirm whether this trend can persist into the end-of-year period.\nSource: Data \u2013 TVC, StoneX, Tradingview\nIn terms of volatility, the week was relatively calm for both financial markets and the crypto sector. By the end of the week, major cryptocurrencies showed movements below their weekly average, generating a period of stability. This may reduce fear of aggressive swings like those seen in previous weeks and help sustain a sense of calm that could support more stable demand in the short term.\nSource: Data \u2013 TVC, StoneX, Tradingview\nThus, as positive correlation with traditional risk markets continues and volatility remains relatively stable, the cryptocurrency market may benefit from a gradual rise in risk appetite, which could support cons"

The pound\u2019s performance has been buoyed by a mix of domestic fiscal reassurance, improving investor sentiment post-budget, and fading U.S. dollar strength ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting. As of late London trading, GBP/USD trades near 1.3240, up 0.32% on the day, having posted five consecutive daily gains, its longest winning streak since September. The currency pair\u2019s near-term trajectory now hinges on the interplay between the Bank of England\u2019s cautious policy stance and growing conviction that the Fed will deliver another rate cut in two weeks.\nSterling Builds on Fiscal Optimism as UK Budget and Bond Stability Support Demand\nThe rally in the pound began immediately following the UK Chancellor\u2019s budget presentation, which stabilized gilt markets and restored confidence in Britain\u2019s fiscal outlook. The GBP/USD pair briefly hit a four-week high of 1.3260 before settling around 1.3220. The market interpreted the government\u2019s balanced tone\u2014avoiding both austerity and excessive spending\u2014as a signal of fiscal prudence, which reduced pressure on the Bank of England to act aggressively.\nUK bond yields remained steady, and foreign investors returned to gilts after months of capital outflows, reinforcing sterling\u2019s strength. According to Standard Chartered, these conditions have positioned GBP/USD to potentially advance toward 1.34 in December, contingent upon a dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve.\nFederal Reserve Dovish Turn Weakens USD and Fuels Pound Resilience\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s broad retreat has amplified GBP/USD\u2019s upside. The DXY index, which tracks the dollar against major peers, slipped below 100.20, losing nearly 1.4% over the week as traders priced in a near 75\u201380% probability of a December rate cut. Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams, have publicly endorsed further easing, citing softer inflation and weakening labor data. The October CPI print at 2.8% and non-farm payrolls rising just 155,000 reinforced expectations for a dovish policy shift.\nWhile the Fed\u2019s rate cuts are intended to cushion slowing growth, they are simultaneously eroding dollar yields\u2014pushing traders toward higher-yielding currencies like GBP. Historically, during similar easing cycles (2019 and 2023), the GBP/USD pair gained between 4\u20136% in the following month, suggesting potential continuation toward 1.3350\u20131.3400 in the near term if policy divergence widens further.\nBank of England Holds Line at 5.00% but December Cut Looms\nThe Bank of England remains cautious as inflation proves sticky, with October CPI at 4.1%, still double its 2% target. However, weak economic growth\u2014Q3 GDP at just 0.1% and the OBR slashing 2026 growth forecasts to 0.8%\u2014has intensified pressure for a rate reduction. Markets now price a 65% probability that the BoE will lower its policy rate to 3.75% at the December meeting.\nEven so, policymakers including Governor Andrew Bailey maintain a hawkish undertone, signaling that cuts will be \u201cgradual and conditional.\u201d This cautious posture has paradoxically benefited sterling, as investors see the BoE as slower to pivot than the Fed. The divergence reinforces medium-term support for GBP/USD above 1.3180, while the 1.3300 resistance remains the immediate test before the December central bank meetings.\nTechnical Analysis: Sterling\u2019s Bullish Structure Intact but Momentum Slows Near 1.3300\nThe GBP/USD daily chart shows a firm uptrend that began after the pair\u2019s "

                "body": "Nasdaq\u2019s International Securities Exchange is seeking approval to sharply increase the daily trading cap on options linked to BlackRock Inc.\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, responding to surging demand from market participants.\nIn a filing released Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the exchange wants to boost the current 250,000-contract daily limit on the ETF which trades under the ticker IBIT to as many as 1 million contracts.\nAccording to the filing, Nasdaq emphasized that the proposed position and exercise limits for IBIT options are aligned with those already in place for similar iShares products, including the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. This framing suggests that the exchange sees IBIT as having matured enough to fall under the same regulatory structure as other established equity and international funds.\nTim Sun, senior researcher at Hashkey Group, noted that Nasdaq\u2019s push to expand IBIT\u2019s limits reflects more than just higher volumes. It highlights a broader evolution in how traders interact with Bitcoin-related instruments. The proposal \u201csignals significant demand for hedging tools, more robust risk-management options, and increasingly sophisticated trading strategies,\u201d he said.\nThe move represents Nasdaq\u2019s second attempt to widen the ETF\u2019s contract ceiling. Shortly after IBIT options received regulatory approval earlier this year, the exchange sought to raise the limit tenfold from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts as trading interest accelerated at an unexpected pace. The SEC signed off on that change in July, allowing activity to scale quickly across the market.\nSince then, IBIT has cemented itself as the dominant force in US Bitcoin ETF trading. The fund, which now manages roughly $70 billion in assets, has become the principal gateway for crypto-linked options activity. At its peak in October, open interest in IBIT options topped $50 billion, placing it on par with Deribit, the world\u2019s largest dedicated crypto options platform.\nData shows that contracts associated with IBIT account for 98% of all options trading tied to Bitcoin ETFs and roughly 96% of total open interest across the category underscoring just how central the product has become to institutional investors.\nThat institutional shift is playing a crucial role in shaping market direction. Large asset managers and professional traders are increasingly relying on regulated, exchange-listed tools such as IBIT to fine-tune their Bitcoin exposure while avoiding the complexities of offshore or unregulated venues.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. offered a clear example of that migration this week, filing plans to launch structured notes tied to IBIT. According to Sun, more issuers are likely to follow JPMorgan\u2019s lead as investor appetite for compliant, transparent Bitcoin-linked instruments continues to grow. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that additional structured products will adopt IBIT as their underlying asset,\u201d he said, calling it a natural step as institutional involvement in the digital-asset space deepens.\nThe proposal to expand IBIT\u2019s options limits also reinforces how quickly crypto-related markets are integrating with traditional financial infrastructure. As Bitcoin becomes increasingly woven into regulated investment products, exchanges like Nasdaq are adjusting capacity, oversight, and position rules to keep pace with institutional use cases.\nIf the SEC approves the latest request, options traders would gain significantly more flexibility in sizing positions, constructing hedges, and building advanced strategies around Bitcoin\u2019s volatility potentially encouraging even greater liquidity and depth in the market. For fund managers looking to navigate crypto exposure with precision, the change could mark an important milestone.\nThe filing\u2019s timing also reflects how rapidly the regulatory environment around digital-asset products is evolving.

IBIT also generated an estimated $245 million in annual fees by October 2025.\nIBIT\u2019s rapid growth has been fueled by BlackRock\u2019s global distribution network and a wave of institutional interest following U.S. regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. It now holds over 3% of bitcoin\u2019s total supply, and it was followed by various BTC-linked products from BlackRock, including ETPs overseas.\nCastro addressed recent outflows from bitcoin funds, saying that such movement is expected given how retail investors tend to react to price drops. \u201cETFs are a very liquid and powerful tool.

With easing short-term selling and institutional accumulation on-chain, Ethereum shows tentative stability. Traders and analysts are monitoring whether ETH can sustain momentum toward higher resistance levels in the near term.\nEthereum Price Rebounds After Strong Support\nUsing the daily ETH/USD chart on TradingView, Ethereum recently tested the $2,650\u2013$2,750 zone, a support level that historically coincided with rebounds during the mid-2022 and mid-2023 market cycles. Support levels like this often indicate areas where buyers have previously stepped in, though past performance does not guarantee future outcomes.\nSince 2016, periods when Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) MVRV Z-Score falls below 0 have historically indicated optimal accumulation opportunities for investors. Source: Ali Martinez via X\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s bounce from $2,650 demonstrates resilience at a historically significant support level,\u201d said Ali Martinez, an on-chain analyst who tracks Ethereum trends. \u201cIndicators such as volume and recent candlestick patterns suggest that short-term momentum is gradually building for a possible upward move.\u201d\nWhy this matters: Support levels provide traders with reference points for risk management and potential entry points. Monitoring volume and price action at these levels can help assess whether momentum is likely to continue.\nBullish Megaphone Pattern Signals Potential Upside\nEthereum\u2019s charts show a bullish megaphone pattern, characterized by successively higher highs and higher lows. This formation often signals increasing volatility and the potential for upward breakouts, but it is not a certainty. Analysts also note a contracting triangle pattern on the same chart, which can precede continuation moves once the price breaks decisively from the structure.\nEthereum (ETH/USD) broke a descending trendline and consolidation, showing bullish momentum toward $3,250 and $3,650, supported by $2,650\u2013$2,750 demand. Source: Harry Brook3 on TradingView\nBased on 4-hour and daily timeframes, immediate technical targets for Ethereum are around $3,180\u2013$3,250, with a secondary scenario reaching $3,550\u2013$3,650 if momentum strengthens.\n\u201cSome market commentators express bullish sentiment on social platforms, though these views are speculative and based on short-term price movements rather than formal financial analysis,\u201d said Gordon T., a crypto market analyst. \u201cSuch sentiment can influence short-term trading but should be interpreted cautiously.\u201d\nKey takeaway: Chart patterns like megaphones can indicate potential price ranges but are conditional, not predictive certainties. They should be considered alongside volume, RSI, and other technical indicators.\nInstitutional Confidence Supports Market Outlook\nInstitutional accumulation is an additional factor affecting the Ethereum price today. On-chain data from Etherscan and verified Ethereum treasury reports indicate that BitMine Immersion Technologies holds approximately 3.63 million ETH, representing about 3% of the circulating supply. While this figure comes from blockchain records rather than formal SEC filings, it provides a verifiable reference point for market participants.\nBitMine Immersion Technology acquired 69,822 ETH (~$195M) last week, raising its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, representing 3% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply.

This digital asset is currently exhibiting remarkable stability as it flirts with critical support levels, a development that both traders and investors should closely monitor. Understanding the undercurrents of Ethereum's fluctuations is not just useful\u2014it's essential for anticipating where this intriguing asset might venture next.\nEvaluating Ethereum's Support Mechanisms\nStaying comfortably nestled above the $3,000 threshold, Ethereum has forged a significant support range between $2,900 and $3,050. This battleground displays a strong pulse of buying interest, as evidenced by recent market behavior\u2014persistent buybacks have taken place in the wake of minor dips, highlighting a scene of durable resilience. Analysts characterize this current state as a tightrope walk, with both buyers and sellers engaging in an ongoing tug-of-war amid the pressures of a capricious market.\nThe Intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s Price Dynamics\nEthereum's latest trading patterns illustrate a reality marked by sharp intraday fluctuations, accurately reflecting the broader crypto market's restlessness. The trading volume soared to an impressive nearly $39 billion, a testament to its allure and the heightened vigilance among investors. This volatility demonstrates a market engaged in constant recalibration, with traders striving to pinpoint the next compelling opportunities that might materialize.\nWhales: The Giants Beneath the Surface\nWithin this realm of uncertainty, the moves of cryptocurrency whales cannot be ignored. The transfer of 1,300 ETH to prominent wallets has caught the eye of many, highlighting strategic maneuvers by those wielding substantial influence. Remarkably, even as these large transfers stir short-term volatility, they do not erode the robust support levels that Ethereum has established. Such actions underline the resolve of long-term holders to maintain Ethereum's structural soundness amidst stirring times.\nGazing into the Future: Resistance and Predictions\nAs we look ahead, keen observers note resistance levels on the horizon around $3,200 and potentially higher. If Ethereum can muster the strength to ascend these pivotal thresholds, forecasts point towards a thrilling ascent towards the $3,530 milestone. However, caution is warranted; price reversals often emerge swiftly, compelled by external forces such as Bitcoin's fluctuations and critical macroeconomic indicators like the U.S. Non-Farm Payroll data.\nThe Institutional Influence on Ethereum\u2019s Trajectory\nThe growing presence of institutional investors is reshaping the dialogue surrounding Ethereum's price movements. A striking $122.6 million liquidation by BlackRock has raised eyebrows and set off alarms about the escalating impact of these entities on the market's dynamics. Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, voices concerns about how such significant buy-ins could jeopardize decentralization and accessibility for the average user. This multifaceted narrative drives deeper contemplation of Ethereum's future potential.\nConclusion: The Path Ahead for Ethereum\nEthereum\u2019s resilience stands as a powerful narrative amid a fluctuating market landscape, with essential support levels providing a solid foundation. The interplay of whale activity, institutional affiliations, and overarching economic factors will be pivotal in steering Ethereum's course in the coming days. By staying vigilant regarding support and resistance zones, traders can position themselves with insight as this ever-evolving digital frontier unfolds. Embracing the challenges and opportunities ahead might well illuminate the path through the fascinating yet unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency investing."

ETH is positioning for a massive 2026 run, but the real generational wealth happens in presales that launch into that momentum.\nDeepSnitch AI just crossed $614,000 at $0.02527, with working AI tools already live. With the January launch coming soon, it only needs to cross the $4 mark for a whopping ROI.\nBhutan\u2019s strategic ETH staking supports long-term Ethereum price prediction\nData on Arkham revealed on November 28, 2025, that Bhutan staked 320 ETH through Figment, expanding its crypto validator operations beyond just Bitcoin mining. Figment works with big institutional clients, helping them earn solid ETH staking returns while powering and securing major proof-of-stake networks.\nBhutan has been building crypto positions since 2019, quietly mining Bitcoin using hydropower resources. They now hold 6,154 BTC worth over $562 million. Adding ETH staking to their sovereign reserves signals they see compelling ETH staking returns as viable long-term yield generation compared to traditional reserves.\nThis institutional validation is exactly why Ethereum price prediction experts are revising 2026 targets upward. When governments stake nearly $1 million in ETH and build critical infrastructure on the network, that changes market dynamics fundamentally.\nDeepSnitch AI ($DSNT): The AI presale capturing smart money flow\nWith Ethereum network upgrades improving scalability and ETH staking returns attracting institutional capital, projects building quality tools on solid infrastructure are positioned for explosive 2026 growth.\nDeepSnitch AI is dominating the presale space with AI trading tools that actually work right now. SnitchFeed tracks whale wallet movements in real-time, alerting users before major price swings. SnitchScan analyzes smart contract code, flagging vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns before they explode into rug pulls.\nBoth tools are live in beta, processing actual market data and delivering actionable intelligence to early users.\nThe full platform will include five specialized AI agents covering viral trend prediction, cross-chain flow analysis, risk scoring for new tokens, whale behavior patterns, and sentiment analysis processing millions of social signals. All launching January 31st.\nDeepSnitch AI presale has raised $614,000 and 65% gains across stages. Current price sits at $0.02527 with launch locked for January 31, 2026. With its mix of real AI tools and meme-level hype, many traders think a 300x run is easy.\nEthereum price prediction 2026\nETH currently trades around $3,037 on Nov 28 after consolidating from recent highs. But the technical and fundamental setup for 2026 looks increasingly bullish.\nEthereum network upgrades continue to improve network efficiency. The merge to proof-of-stake cut energy consumption 99.95%, making ETH attractive to ESG-focused institutions like Bhutan. Future scalability upgrades targeting sharding and Layer 2 integration could unlock mainstream adoption at scale.\nETH staking returns currently offer 3 to 4% annual yields, incentivizing long-term holding that reduces circulating supply. As more governments and institutions stake ETH following Bhutan\u2019s lead, supply shocks become probable.\nThe Ethereum price prediction for 2026 could range from $4,500 conservatively to $8,000+ if institutional adoption accelerates. Bhutan\u2019s national ID migration, completing in early 2026, could trigger other governments to follow, creating sovereign adoption momentum.\nHowever, ETH at current prices offers maybe 2x-3x upside. Presales offer massive potential. That\u2019s why smart traders maintain ETH core positions while allocating small percentages to high-conv"

                "body": "It hasn't been a great year for Solana (SOL 1.22%). The world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 30% in 2025. While all cryptocurrencies have taken a hit over the past 30 days, Solana has been especially hard hit as it fell through the $200 price level.\nBut three big catalysts are on the horizon for Solana. If everything goes according to plan, then the price of Solana could take off in 2026. Here's what to watch.\nComprehensive new crypto legislation\nDuring the summer, the U.S. Congress made enormous headway on crypto legislation. The highlight, of course, was the passage of new stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act.\nOnce that was signed into law, the next step was supposed to be the passage of comprehensive new crypto legislation. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (H.R. 3633) passed the House in July, and all lights were flashing green.\nBut then came the federal government shutdown. Suddenly, all the momentum for crypto came to a grinding halt. That helps explain why investors suddenly soured on the crypto market and why sentiment is still at very low levels for Solana right now.\nBut all that could change within the next few months. The Senate is coming up with its own version of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the thinking now is that it might be ready to go by early 2026.\nIf so, it would provide a huge boost to Solana and its blockchain ecosystem. As a layer 1 blockchain network, Solana is a core building block of everything that happens in the blockchain world. So any legislation that pushes forward the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology could be a tremendous driver of value for Solana.\nI wouldn't be surprised if all layer 1 blockchains -- including Ethereum (ETH 1.53%) -- receive a huge boost from the new legislation.\nA new blockchain upgrade\nAt the same time, Solana just received an important new blockchain upgrade in the form of the new high-performance Firedancer validator client. In layman's terms, it will be easier, cheaper, and faster to add blocks to the Solana blockchain, and that will lead to dramatic improvements in transaction processing speeds and overall efficiency.\nSolana has already far surpassed Ethereum in terms of transaction processing speeds, attracting the attention of high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Now, Firedancer is going to put Solana into an entirely new class of its own.\nThe thinking now is that Solana could be well on its way to processing 1 million transactions per second. That's blazing fast, and that type of speed has always been one of the Holy Grails of the blockchain world. Ethereum, for example, has been talking about 1 million transactions per second for years now.\nA surge in usage and activity\nSpeed matters. It's what leads to dramatic upticks in users and overall blockchain usage. And right now, the Solana blockchain ecosystem is firing on all cylinders. According to a recent research report from 21Shares, the Solana blockchain ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue over the most recent 12-month period.\nOne area where Solana is fast becoming a star is decentralized finance (DeFi). While Ethereum is still the acknowledged market leader here, Solana is making huge strides. It now ranks second behind Ethereum, with a roughly 10% market share of the DeFi market. And it has already passed Ethereum in terms of 24-hour trading volume on its decentralized exchanges.\nIs Solana a $300 crypto?\nAll three of these catalysts could help catapult Solana forward in 2026. Solana is currently trading at a healthy 55% discount to its all-time high of $294 from January. That seems like a dramatic investor overreaction to the global macroeconomic outlook. How much has really changed for Solana over the past 12 months?\nCRYPTO: SOL\nKey Data Points\nMy prediction is that Solana could make a serious run at the $300 price level in 2026. If that's the case, then the time to buy is now. If you wait until January, it might be too late."

                "body": "The Best Cryptocurrency to Buy With $500 Right Now\nKey Points\nSolana is up about 40% during the past 90 days, buoyed by heavy buying from new Solana treasury companies.\nDuring the past 12 months, the Solana blockchain ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue.\nSolana could one day de-throne Ethereum as the preeminent smart contract blockchain network.\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency investing, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) typically get all the headlines. And for good reason. Both are up about 30% for the year, and both should be core components of any well-diversified crypto portfolio.\nBut if you only have $500 to spend on crypto right now, there might be a better option: Solana (CRYPTO: SOL). The sixth-biggest cryptocurrency in the world is up about 40% during the past 90 days, and is suddenly gaining a lot of attention due to the likely introduction of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Here's why you should consider Solana to be the next crypto in your portfolio.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIs Solana the heir apparent to Ethereum?\nSoon after it launched back in March 2020, Solana immediately made headlines as a potential Ethereum killer. Just like Ethereum, Solana is a smart contract blockchain network with a very diversified blockchain ecosystem.\nBut there's one key difference: Solana is blazingly fast, and much cheaper to use. The total throughput capacity on Solana is now more than 100,000 transactions per second. By way of comparison, the core Ethereum blockchain struggles to process 30 transactions per second.\nWhat's really exciting is that all of that amazing throughput capacity is now being put to work, generating a surprising amount of revenue for Solana blockchain ecosystem partners.\nAccording to investment firm 21Shares, Solana generated more than $2.85 billion in revenue during the past 12 months. This revenue came from a variety of activities, including decentralized finance (DeFi), cryptocurrency trading, meme coins, decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), and artificial intelligence (AI). That's on par with the 12-month revenue figures of companies such as Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD).\nThe rise of Solana treasury companies\nAt one time, digital asset treasury companies were limited exclusively to Bitcoin. These companies raise money from outside investors, and then immediately use that money to invest in one specific cryptocurrency. The pioneer here is Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which has now accumulated $78 billion worth of Bitcoin.\nBut of late, new publicly traded Solana treasury companies have launched as well. All told, there are 18 different companies that hold more $4 billion in Solana. That's roughly equivalent to 3% of Solana's total circulating supply.\nThe important point here is that this new source of demand is likely to send Solana higher. That has been the case with the Bitcoin treasury companies and the Ethereum treasury companies. In some instances, these new Solana treasury companies have secured multi-billion-dollar commitments from outside investors. So there is money just waiting to be put to work buying Solana.\nAdvertisement\nThe new Solana ETFs\nI've saved the best for last, and that's the imminent launch of Solana ETFs. These spot ETFs will work just like the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the spot Ethereum ETFs. They will hold just a single cryptocurrency (in this case, Solana), and will give investors exposure to the spot price of Solana via a familiar investment product.\nWhile the level of institutional demand for Solana is nowhere near that for Bitcoin or Ethereum, it's nonetheless impressive. According to the latest fund flow data from CoinShares, more than $1.5 billion has already flowed into Solana this year via a variety of different investment products. Earlier this year, JPMo"

                "body": "In 2025, the Federal Reserve\u2019s evolving approach to monetary policy has introduced new complexities for global investors. As central banks weigh the challenges of managing inflation while supporting economic growth, uncertainty around policy direction is prompting institutions to reconsider their asset allocations. Increasingly, capital is flowing toward advanced blockchain platforms such as Solana, which offer innovative infrastructure, global utility, and impressive technical scalability.\nWhen the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to 3.75\u20134.00% in October 2025, it marked a significant transition from a tightening stance to a more cautious easing. Yet, Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks that additional rate reductions are \u201cfar from certain\u201d have left markets unsettled. The situation has been further complicated by delays in economic data caused by a U.S. government shutdown, making traditional investment strategies more challenging.\nWith equity markets remaining volatile and bond yields subdued, institutional investors are increasingly exploring digital assets. Recent research from Bitwise highlights this trend: Solana-based ETFs, such as the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), attracted $417 million in their first week, while the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) saw $1 million in inflows. These movements signal a strategic pivot toward digital assets that are perceived as more resilient to macroeconomic turbulence.\nSolana\u2019s growing appeal among institutions is largely driven by its technological progress. Upgrades like Alpenglow and the Firedancer validator client have dramatically improved network performance, enabling block finality in just 150 milliseconds and supporting over one million transactions per second. These advancements directly address scalability issues that have historically limited blockchain adoption, aligning with the Federal Reserve\u2019s broader interest in AI-powered financial infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s robust developer community and infrastructure grants have paved the way for real-world applications. Notably, collaborations with major players like Western Union and Visa have positioned Solana as a key platform for international payments. Visa\u2019s decision to integrate Solana into its stablecoin settlement network\u2014moving from experimental phases to full-scale production\u2014underscores the blockchain\u2019s growing credibility among institutions.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s policy adjustments in 2025 have indirectly accelerated Solana\u2019s adoption for cross-border transactions. As quantitative tightening winds down and liquidity increases, Solana\u2019s stablecoin ecosystem has surged\u2014from $5.2 billion at the end of 2024 to $16 billion in 2025. This rapid growth supports fast, affordable transactions, meeting the needs of emerging markets where traditional banking infrastructure often falls short, as noted by industry experts.\nDespite this momentum, challenges remain. In recent weeks, Solana\u2019s stablecoin liquidity has dropped by 8.16%, indicating possible constraints on on-chain activity. Regulatory scrutiny, especially concerning stablecoin oversight, continues to pose uncertainties. Nevertheless, real-world integrations\u2014such as Western Union\u2019s blockchain-based remittance pilot\u2014suggest a promising path toward sustained adoption, according to recent industry analyses.\nLooking ahead, expectations that the Federal Reserve will shift to quantitative easing in early 2026 are likely to boost liquidity for risk assets, with Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem standing to benefit, according to market observers. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which experienced outflows following the October 2025 rate cut, Solana ETFs attracted $37.33 million in new investments. This divergence highlights Solana\u2019s unique role as a macroeconomic hedge, combining robust infrastructure with global utility.\nImportantly, institutional engagement with Solana is grounded in real activity rather than speculation.

The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), growth stock-dominated Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), and ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) have all logged several record-closing highs this year.\nThere's little question that hype surrounding the evolution of artificial intelligence has powered all three indexes higher. Empowering software and systems with the tools to make rapid decisions without the need for human oversight or intervention is a potential game changer for most industries around the world.\nInvestors are also excited about the Federal Reserve's ongoing rate-easing cycle. Lowering interest rates makes borrowing less costly for businesses, which can lead to increased hiring, more spending on innovation, and an uptick in merger and acquisition activity.\nBut things may not be as rosy with the U.S. economy as the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average would appear to indicate. While the economy and stock market aren't joined at the hip, what happens with the former typically influences the latter.\nAccording to several economic data points, the foundation of the U.S. economy appears to be breaking -- and Wall Street has, thus far, been content in turning a blind eye.\nKey economic indicators are making dubious history\nTo preface the following discussion, no data point or correlated event can guarantee what's to come for the U.S. economy or stock market. Nevertheless, select data points and correlative events do have a phenomenal track record of forecasting the future. The following economic indicators all suggest trouble is brewing with the U.S. economy and/or banking system.\nTo begin with, the delinquency rate for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) hit an all-time high of 11.76% in October 2025, according to commercial real estate research and analytics firm Trepp. To put this figure into perspective, CMBS delinquencies have increased almost tenfold since 2023 and are now a whole percentage point higher than they were in the years following the financial crisis.\nWith interest rates kept at or near historic lows by the Federal Reserve throughout the 2010s and following the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial real estate builders saw opportunity, even if corporate demand for office space wasn't apparent. However, a modest uptick in the U.S. unemployment rate, coupled with growth in the work-from-home culture that stemmed from the pandemic, has left the commercial real estate landscape in a potentially precarious position.\nAuto loan delinquencies are also climbing at an alarming pace. According to the latest update from Fitch Ratings, the Auto Loan 60+ Delinquency Index -- this measures subprime auto loans where payments are delinquent by at least 60 days -- hit an all-time high of 6.65% in October. Subprime auto loan delinquencies during the Great Recession topped out at around 5%, and previously peaked at close to 6% in 1996.\nAs of the end of September, outstanding auto loan debt in the U.S. stood at $1.66 trillion. Although an auto loan delinquency crisis wouldn't hit the U.S. financial system as hard as the subprime mortgage crisis did in the late 2000s, it wouldn't be a drop in the bucket or something that could be swept under the rug, either.\nThe final piece of this terrifying puzzle involves severe U.S. credit card delinquencies, which have been steadily increasing over the past two years.\nBased on data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the share of U.S. credit card balances in arrears on their payments by at least 90 days rose to 12.41% in the third quarter of 2025. This represents the highest percentage of severe delinquencies since the first quarter of 2011, and is about 130 basis points away from setting an all-time high, which was recorded in 2010, shortly after the height of the financial crisis.\nWith outstanding credit card debt surg"

Oracle shares fell 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.\nSome tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, because of excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.\nThe market turned around on hopes the Federal Reserve will again cut interest rates at its December meeting. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10. Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.\nThe central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.\nThe minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.\nInvestors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event.\nMacy's shares fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch shares rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.\nAmid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Shares of pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.\nEarlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours because of a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to a failure at a CyrusOne data center.\nTreasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.\nIn European trading, Germany's DAX rose 0.3% even as a report showed inflation accelerated more than expected in November and rose to the highest level since February.\nThe CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%.\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.2% after data showed Japan's housing starts rose 3.2% in October from the same period a year ago, the first annual increase since March.\nSouth Korea's Kospi dropped 1.5% after the country's industrial production fell 4% month-on-month in October, more than the 1.1% decline in September."

The broader software sector has been under pressure, with investors worried about AI-driven disruption. But Salesforce is positioning itself to lead the next phase of enterprise AI through its Agentforce 360 platform and the recently completed acquisition of Informatica.\nMarkets are looking for Salesforce to report around $10.3bn in revenue, with 9% growth.

                "body": "Does the long-term nature of investing in a SIPP mean compounding dividends becomes even more attractive?\nThat depends on the strategy someone takes when it comes to investing their SIPP. For a lot of SIPP investors, though, the idea of dividends building upon dividends for years or even decades is attractive.\nWith that in mind, here are three high-yield shares I think an investor ought to consider for their SIPP in the coming month.\nM&G\nWith its 7.4% dividend yield, FTSE 100 asset manager M&G (LSE: MNG) is not as lucrative as it has been at some points over the past few years.\nBut its yield is still over double the blue-chip index\u2019s average.\nThe lower yield than before does not reflect a smaller dividend per share. In fact, M&G aims to grow its dividend per share annually \u2013 and has done that in the past few years.\nSo, why has the yield fallen? The simple answer is share price growth. The M&G share price has grown by 41% over the past five years.\nThe business model is simple but proven. With millions of clients and a strong brand, I think M&G has the right tools to keep generating substantial amounts of excess cash.\nThat is not guaranteed, of course, and neither is the dividend. One risk I see is that rocky financial markets could lead to investors pulling more money out of M&G funds than they put in.\nPhoenix Group\nAnother FTSE 100 financial services company with a high yield I think investors should consider for a SIPP is Standard Life\u2019s parent Phoenix Group (LSE: PHNX).\nThe company focuses on long-term savings and retirement products. With over 12m customers, it is a big operation that benefits from significant economies of scale.\nPhoneix has deep expertise in specialist financial markets that it has been able to parlay into ongoing cash generation.\nThat helps the firm fund a generous dividend. Like M&G, the company aims to grow its dividend per share each year. That could be lucrative, as the dividend yield already stands at a juicy 7.9%.\nWill Phoenix keep delivering on its dividend aspirations?\nOne risk I see is the property market. Phoenix\u2019s mortgage book includes presumptions about property value. Any significant fall in the market could require revaluation, eating into Phoenix\u2019s earnings.\nOver the long run, though, I see the business model as a promising one to keep the high-dividend share delivering attractive payouts.\nPets at Home\nSometimes a share can lose its appeal for investors, even though the long-term direction of travel for its business still looks promising.\nCould that be the case for Pets at Home (LSE: PETS)?"

                "body": "FTSE 100 contract caterer Compass Group (LSE:CPG) absolutely dominates its industry, but the stock\u2019s faltered this year. So should I buy the dip, or is this a sign of things to come?\nIt\u2019s fair to say the stock has lost some momentum recently. But I\u2019m very interested in what I think could be a clear path to sustained revenue growth for the long term.\nWarning signs\nIt\u2019s easy enough to see why the stock\u2019s been falling. The underlying business seems to have lost some momentum after a strong recovery coming out of Covid-19.\nA key metric for monitoring this is organic revenue growth. This measures how much sales have been increasing by adjusting for acquisitions (more on those later).\nThe firm was never going to keep growing at 37.5% a year. But the rate continues to slow and the stock still trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio roughly double the FTSE 100 average.\nGiven all this, investors might well think the stock\u2019s overvalued. In fact though, it\u2019s getting to a point where I\u2019m starting to take it seriously as a potential buy for my portfolio.\nA heavyweight\nCompass is the largest operator in the contract catering industry. And with revenues roughly equal to its nearest two competitors combined, it\u2019s a true FTSE 100 heavyweight.\nThat size is a big advantage. Being able to buy ingredients in larger volumes than its rivals gives the company a crucial advantage when it comes to costs.\nA decentralised approach means the firm benefits from local and industry-specific knowledge as well as economies of scale. And that\u2019s a powerful combination.\nAll of this makes Compass very difficult to disrupt and this goes some way towards justifying the relatively high multiple. But there\u2019s also more to the firm\u2019s growth prospects.\nAcquisitions\nCompass has previously grown by acquiring other companies and management expects this to continue. Investors typically see this as risky though, and justifiably so.\nWith acquisitions, there\u2019s always a danger of paying too much for a business. But while the risk can\u2019t be eliminated, it can be limited and this is something the firm does very well.\nAs said, Compass is the largest operator in the contract catering industry, but the firm only accounts for around 11% of the market. And it estimates that 75% consists of local or regional operators.\nThe company\u2019s ability to add value by incorporating new subsidiaries into its existing network means there could be a lot of scope for growth. This is something to take seriously.\nBuy time?\nOrganic growth might be falling, but I think Compass has a lot of scope for long-term growth. It has a very strong position in an important industry and that\u2019s a valuable combination.\nIntrinsically, I think it\u2019s cheap enough for me to buy it, but I\u2019m holding back for now. The question is whether I can find even better value elsewhere \u2013 and that might be the case in today\u2019s stock market."

He assumes that this will be Powell's last monetary policy measure.\nAfter the holiday break on the US stock markets, momentum from overseas is likely to pick up again in general.

On Friday, November 28, the Nikkei 225 eked out a modest gain and finished the week firmly higher, even as November goes into the books as the index\u2019s worst performance for that month in more than a decade. [1]\nAt the same time, a major weekend headline \u2014 Micron\u2019s plan to pour 1.5 trillion yen into a new AI memory chip plant in Hiroshima \u2014 underlines how Japan\u2019s semiconductor ambitions and global artificial-intelligence spending are becoming an increasingly important pillar for Tokyo-listed stocks. [2]\nKey takeaways for Nov 28\u201329, 2025\n- Nikkei 225 closed Friday at 50,253.91, up about 0.2% on the day and 3.4% for the week, but down just over 4% for November \u2014 its worst November since 2011. [3]\n- Topix finished at 3,378.44, gaining roughly 0.3% on Friday and also ending the week higher. [4]\n- Friday\u2019s advance was powered by hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates in December and by solid local data on Tokyo inflation and housing. [5]\n- Under the surface, investors rotated out of overheated AI and chip names and into machinery, industrial and infrastructure-linked stocks such as Okuma and Furukawa Electric. [6]\n- On Saturday, November 29, Reuters reported Micron will invest about \u00a51.5 trillion ($9.6 billion) in a Hiroshima plant to produce high\u2011bandwidth memory chips for AI, with up to \u00a5500 billion in Japanese government subsidies \u2014 a long\u2011term positive signal for Japan\u2019s chip supply chain. [7]\n- The Bank of Japan is openly preparing markets for a possible rate hike at its December 18\u201319 meeting, while the yen trades around \u00a5156 per dollar and Japanese government bond yields sit near multi\u2011decade highs. [8]\nHow Tokyo stocks traded on Friday, November 28, 2025\nFriday was the last trading day of the month for the Tokyo Stock Exchange; the market is closed on Saturdays, including November 29. [9]\nBy the closing bell:\n- Nikkei 225: 50,253.91 (+86.81 points, +0.17% vs Thursday) [10]\n- Topix: 3,378.44 (+9.87 points, +0.29%) [11]\nThe moves look small, but they capped a meaningful recovery from mid\u2011month lows. From Wednesday\u2019s strong rally through Friday\u2019s close, the Nikkei rose roughly 3.4% for the week, even as it remained down just over 4% for November as a whole. [12]\nReuters data cited by The Economic Times show that advances comfortably outnumbered declines on the day, with 143 Nikkei constituents rising against 80 falling. [13] That breadth \u2014 modest index gains but broadly positive participation \u2014 fits with the idea that Tokyo\u2019s market is rotating rather than capitulating.\nBest and worst performers: machinery shines, select materials lag\nFriday\u2019s session in Tokyo continued a theme that has been building through late November: investors are dialling back exposure to the frothiest AI\u2011linked names and shifting money into more traditional cyclicals and value stocks. TS2 Tech\nAccording to the Reuters breakdown carried by The Economic Times: [14]\n- Top gainers on the Nikkei\n- Okuma \u2013 The machine\u2011tool maker was the day\u2019s biggest winner, climbing about 6.7% as traders bet that stronger global manufacturing and robust domestic capital expenditure will boost demand for factory automation equipment.\n- Furukawa Electric \u2013 Shares rose roughly 4.7%, helped by expectations of sustained spending on power grids, EV components and communications infrastructure.\n- Key losers\n- Mitsui Mining & Smelting (Mitsui Kinzoku) fell about 2.1%.\n- Toho Co. slipped roughly 2.0%.\nMarket commentary from TS2.tech, which synthesised reporting from AP, Xinhua and Reuters, noted that several AI\u2011exposed chip and electronics names, including Kioxia\u2011related plays and precision equipment makers such as Lasertec, spent parts of the session in the red before the broader market firmed into the close.

After most of November felt heavy, buyers stepped back in and kept pushing the market higher through every session of the shortened week.\nThe S&P 500 gained 3.73% to finish at 6,849.09, the Nasdaq rallied nearly 5%, and the Dow added just over 3%. That steady bid helped the S&P and Dow close November slightly positive, even as the Nasdaq stayed red for the month.\nFive straight up days helped pull the S&P off levels that had traders wondering whether the month\u2019s slide was turning into something bigger.\nA little. The strong weekly run masked what had been a tough stretch, especially for the Nasdaq, which came into Thanksgiving on a three-week skid. Earlier in the month, big AI names were under real pressure as traders rethought lofty valuations.\nStill, stepping back to the weekly view, the market held up better than the day-to-day noise suggested. The S&P is up around 15% for the year \u2014 impressive considering the near bear-market scare in April. Patience has paid off.\nAlmost certainly. Weekly sentiment flipped the moment rate-cut odds surged. Traders now price an 85% chance of a quarter-point cut at the December meeting \u2014 nearly double last week\u2019s levels.\nComments from New York Fed President John Williams, who noted policy may be tighter than needed and pointed to cooler labor trends, gave the market permission to lean harder into easing expectations. If the Fed follows through, that would be the third cut of 2025.\nIt did. The 43-day government shutdown, the longest on record, remained part of the weekly backdrop. The missing October CPI print left traders and policymakers without a key piece of the inflation puzzle.\nThe CBO\u2019s estimate of roughly $11 billion in permanent GDP loss added to the uncertainty. Even if markets weren\u2019t trading headline-to-headline on the shutdown this week, the missing data still shaped the tone.\nCommunication Services and Consumer Discretionary led the weekly move. Meta and Alphabet logged solid gains. Apple hit three fresh all-time highs on encouraging iPhone 17 demand reads. Broadcom was the week\u2019s standout, up over 18% as traders warmed to its expanding role in Google\u2019s AI hardware stack. Nvidia slipped slightly as chatter about alternative chip suppliers kept a lid on buyers.\nTraders enter the new week leaning constructive, helped by lower yields and record-high profit margins. But with the Fed now in blackout mode, the market will trade cleanly off incoming data \u2014 ISM, ADP, and especially PCE.\nBottom line: the weekly trend has turned positive again, but the next leg depends on whether this week\u2019s numbers reinforce the rate-cut story traders embraced over Thanksgiving.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The police announcement came after a group of men aged 20 to 39 ended up on the front lines of the conflict in Ukraine.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4Ukraine says over 1,400 Africans recruited to fight for Russia in war\n- list 2 of 4Russia-backed arson attack ringleaders handed jail sentences in UK\n- list 3 of 4Moscow-backed court jails two Colombians who fought for Ukraine\n- list 4 of 4France detains four amid inquiry into suspected Russian spy network\nZuma-Sambudla had served as a member of parliament since June 2024 for uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), an opposition party created by her father in 2023 following his expulsion from South Africa\u2019s then-governing African National Congress.\n\u201cThe national officials have accepted comrade Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla\u2019s decision to resign and support her efforts to ensure that these young South Africans are brought back safely to their families,\u201d the MK Party\u2019s national chairperson, Nkosinathi Nhleko, told a news conference.\nMK officials said Zuma-Sambudla\u2019s resignation was voluntary and that her departure from the National Assembly and all other public roles was effective immediately.\nThe MK\u2019s Nhleko also said that the party was not involved in luring the men to Russia and that Zuma-Sambudla\u2019s resignation was not an admission of guilt, but added that MK would help support the families of the men stranded in Ukraine.\nZuma-Sambudla was present at the news conference but did not speak, and has not publicly responded to the accusations from her half-sister.\nSouth Africa\u2019s government said earlier this month that 17 of its citizens were stuck in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region after being tricked into fighting for mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts.\nThen, last weekend, police said they would investigate Zuma-Sambudla after her half-sister made a formal request for the probe into her and two other people.\nAccording to police, an affidavit submitted by Zuma-Sambudla\u2019s half-sister, Nkosazana Bonganini Zuma-Mncube, alleged that Zuma-Sambudla and two other people tricked the South Africans into fighting by promising to provide them with security training in Russia. The identities of the other two people were unclear.\nThe affidavit alleges the South Africans were handed over to a Russian mercenary group and forced to fight in the conflict. It also says that eight of the 17 men were members of Zuma-Sambudla\u2019s and Zuma-Mncube\u2019s extended family.\nSouth African presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told Al Jazeera that the government had received \u201cdistress calls\u201d from the group caught up in the Ukraine war, and authorities were \u201cworking ever so quietly\u201d at all levels \u201cto secure their safe return\u201d.\n\u201cBut also, there is an investigation that is ongoing, that\u2019s looking at how they were recruited, who was involved, and what were they promised?\u201d Magwenya said.\nOn Thursday, Jordan became the latest country to rebuke Russia for recruiting its citizens to fight, following the killing of two Jordanian nationals.\nWhile Jordan did not specifically reference Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would \u201ctake all available measures\u201d to end the further recruitment of Jordanians, and called for Moscow to terminate the contracts of its currently enlisted citizens.\nUkraine says Moscow has recruited at least 18,000 foreign fighters from 128 countries, according to figures shared by Ukrainian Brigadier Ge"
