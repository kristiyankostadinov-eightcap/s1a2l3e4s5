                "body": "Gold remains firm, trading around $4,478, just below the all-time high of $4,497, supported by geopolitical risks and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. The gold price benefits from safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions, notably the US-Venezuela situation, and the anticipated easing of Fed interest rates by 2026.\nUS economic data, such as the improved GDP growth of 4.3% in Q3, higher than the 3.3% expected, adds to market dynamics. Despite a rebound in the US Dollar, gold\u2019s technical indicators maintain a strong uptrend, facilitated by bullish momentum and crossing moving averages.\nFactors Influencing Gold Price\nGold\u2019s price increase is influenced by an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and positive technical indicators. Central banks, seeking currency stability, notably increased their gold reserves by 1,136 tonnes in 2022, reflecting a preference for gold as a safe-haven asset amid inflation concerns.\nIn the broader market, investors anticipate holiday restructurings and monitor potential Federal Reserve leadership changes, with discussions about future interest rate paths continuing. Despite high RSI suggesting consolidation, gold\u2019s technical outlook remains positive, with short-term momentum supported by rising averages.\nGiven gold\u2019s position near record highs, the immediate technical picture suggests caution is warranted. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at an overbought level of 81, which often signals a temporary pullback or consolidation period. For traders, this could mean trimming long positions or waiting for a dip before entering new ones.\nInvestment Strategies and Market Outlook\nHowever, the underlying trend remains strongly bullish, supported by expectations of Federal Reserve easing in 2026. Derivative traders might consider buying call options with expiration dates further out in 2026 to capitalize on this longer-term trend while limiting upfront risk. Current market data from the CME FedWatch Tool indicates traders are pricing in a greater than 60% probability of at least two rate cuts by the end of next year, reinforcing this bullish thesis.\nFor those anticipating a short-term correction due to the overbought conditions and holiday profit-taking, buying protective put options could be a prudent strategy. Key support levels to watch are the 9-day moving average around $4,348 and the more significant 50-day average near $4,161. A break below the first level could trigger a faster move toward the second, presenting a short-term opportunity for bearish plays.\nImplied volatility is another key factor, especially with uncertainty around the next Fed Chair and divided policymakers. The CBOE Gold Volatility Index (GVZ) has risen to 18.2, reflecting market anticipation of larger price swings heading into the new year. This elevated volatility increases the premium on options, making strategies like covered calls on existing holdings potentially more profitable.\nUnderpinning the entire market is the immense physical demand from central banks, which provides a strong fundamental floor. Data from the World Gold Council shows that global central banks have added over 1,050 tonnes to their reserves so far in 2025, continuing the record-setting pace we observed back in 2022 and 2023. This consistent buying suggests that major global players see sustained value in gold as a reserve asset.\nLooking at historical precedent, gold has performed well during past Fed easing cycles. Following the rate cuts we saw in 2019, gold rallied significantly over the subsequent 18 months. This pattern suggests that even if we see a near-term pullback, the path of least resistance into 2026 remains upward as monetary policy becomes more accommodative."

That\u2019s notable because overseas investing by the fund and others has weighed on the won, which has fallen about 8% in the second half of the year. Thailand\u2019s baht briefly hit 31 per dollar, helped by gold-related flows, but its roughly 10% rise this year is already raising concerns about export and tourism competitiveness. Zooming out, emergi..\nng-market currencies firmed as a solid US GDP print didn\u2019t change interest-rate expectations, keeping the greenback on pace for its weakest year in more than two decades.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A weaker dollar reshuffles winners and losers.\nWhen the greenback fades, capital often drifts toward higher-yielding or improving emerging markets \u2013 and local currencies can become a tailwind for bond returns. Malaysia\u2019s ringgit, for example, has strengthened this year alongside foreign interest in local bonds. But faster currency gains can also tighten financial conditions at home, especially for companies that rely on exports.\nThe bigger picture: Strong currencies come with tradeoffs.\nPolicymakers across Asia are walking a tightrope: a firmer exchange rate can help tame imported inflation, but it can also make a country\u2019s goods and vacations more expensive abroad. Thailand is openly weighing ways to cool the baht, while South Korea is trying to counter structural outflows with policy steps and pension-fund hedging. If the Fed keeps edging toward rate cuts, that push-pull between inflows and competitiveness is likely to stay in focus.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold holds firm near record highs on geopolitics and Fed outlook\n- Gold pulls back from fresh record highs as the US Dollar regains some footing.\n- Geopolitical risks and Fed easing expectations limit the downside and support the broader bullish bias.\n- Technically, XAU/USD remains in a strong uptrend above rising moving averages despite an overbought RSI.\nGold (XAU/USD) holds firm on Tuesday after coming under brief pressure following a mixed batch of US economic data and a mild rebound in the US Dollar (USD). At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades around $4,478, holding just below the fresh all-time high near $4,497 set earlier in the day.\nGold continues to draw support from escalating geopolitical tensions, which are sustaining safe-haven demand. At the same time, sustained expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could lower interest rates further into 2026 provide an additional tailwind to Bullion, helping prices remain underpinned near record levels.\nThe latest leg higher also reflects year-end repositioning as markets head into the long holiday period. While some profit-taking at elevated levels could trigger short-term consolidation, the broader trend remains constructive, with Gold on course for its strongest annual performance since 1979, up nearly 70% year to date.\nMarket movers: Fed outlook, geopolitics shape market sentiment\n- The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the economy expanded at a strong 4.3% annualised pace in Q3, above the 3.3% market expectation and the prior 3.8% estimate, while inflation measures embedded in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report remained firm, with the GDP Price Index rising 3.7%, Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) increasing 2.9%, and PCE Prices climbing 2.8%.\n- Durable Goods Orders fell 2.2% in October, reversing the previous 0.7% increase. Orders excluding defense declined 1.5%, while Durable Goods Orders excluding transportation rose 0.2%. Industrial Production slipped 0.1% MoM in October.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, trades around 98.10, recovering modestly after dipping to an intraday low near 97.85.\n- Geopolitical tensions between the United States and Venezuela remain high after President Donald Trump imposed a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Speaking on Monday, Trump said the US is \u201cactually pursuing\u201d a tanker that had departed from Venezuela and was under sanctions. US authorities have already seized two Venezuelan-linked oil tankers this month, including one over the weekend.\n- Beyond Geopolitics, markets are currently pricing in two rate cuts in 2026, though policymakers remain divided after delivering a cumulative 75 basis points of easing this year. Fed Governor Stephen Miran said on Monday that recent economic data should \u201cpush people in a dovish direction,\u201d warning that failing to ease policy could raise recession risks.\n- In contrast, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday that she sees no need for rate cuts in the coming months, citing persistent inflation risks and signalling that rates could remain in the 3.50%-3.75% range into the spring.\n- Attention is also focused on a potential leadership change at the Fed, as Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s term is set to end in May 2026. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly signalled his preference for a Fed Chair who would favour lower interest rates. A CNBC report published on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump could announce his decision as early as the first week of January. So far, Trump has interviewed Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while other leading contenders include US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.\nTechnical analysis: Strong bullish trend holds despite overbought RSI\nOn the daily chart, XAU/USD is trading comfortably in uncharted territory after breaking above the Oct"

                "body": "EUR/USD climbs as Greenback flows remain in focus\n- EUR/USD rose about 0.3%, supported by broad US Dollar weakness and expectations for further Fed rate cuts in 2026.\n- Strong US GDP data capped dollar losses, but investors still see the Fed on hold in January before easing later next year.\n- The Dollar Index hit October lows, while thin holiday trading and fading U.S. growth confidence kept pressure on the greenback.\nEUR/USD climbed around 0.3% on Tuesday, bolstered by a general easing in global US Dollar (USD) flows. Broad-market investor sentiment is on the high side heading through a holiday-shortened week, with the Greenback dragged down by expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) easing heading into 2026.\nUSD on the backfoot as Fed rate cut expectations weigh\nThe US Dollar weakened on Tuesday in thin, holiday-shortened trading as expectations for further Fed rate cuts next year continued to weigh on sentiment, even after stronger-than-expected economic data. A surprisingly robust 4.3% annualized rise in third-quarter US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) helped the dollar trim losses against the Euro (EUR), but markets still largely believe the Fed will stay on hold in January before resuming easing later in the year, with futures pricing in two cuts in 2026.\nSome analysts cautioned that the headline GDP strength may overstate the economy\u2019s underlying health, noting that growth was driven heavily by healthcare spending and inventory drawdowns rather than broad-based business momentum. Combined with signs of a weakening labor market and a drop in US consumer confidence in December, these factors reinforced the view that the dollar could remain under pressure into early next year despite near-term resilience in growth data.\nThe Euro held modest gains against the Greenback, while the US Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to its lowest level since early October and remained on track for its steepest annual decline since 2017, reflecting a broader shift away from U.S. dollar strength as global rate expectations evolve.\nWednesday will be the last meaningful market day for the Euro this week; American markets will be closing early on Wednesday, and European markets will be dark on December 25 and 26.\nEUR/USD daily chart\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro.

                "body": "Gold Today, December 23: Record Above $4,400 Pushes Euro Price to Highs\nGold price in euro jumped to fresh highs as spot gold cleared a record above $4,400 per ounce, lifting euro quotes toward \u20ac3,772 today. A weaker dollar, softer real rate expectations, and steady central bank buying drive the move. With year-end liquidity thin, swings can widen, keeping safe-haven demand in focus for German savers. We outline what matters now for entries, risk controls, and portfolio roles, and how the gold price in euro may react to upcoming data and ECB signals.\nDrivers of today\u2019s surge\nGold\u2019s breakout reflects a weaker dollar and lower US real yields, which raise the metal\u2019s appeal versus cash. In dollars, spot set a gold record high above $4,400, a move also visible in euro terms. The mix hints at macro hedging rather than pure speculation, according to this source. For euro investors, the currency lens matters: when the dollar drops, the gold price in euro often rises faster.\nPersistent central bank buying underpins the trend. Reserve managers in emerging markets have added bullion to diversify away from currency risk and to build resilience. That steady bid helps cushion pullbacks and supports higher base prices in euro. It also explains why the gold price in euro can hold up even when futures positioning looks crowded, especially during periods of geopolitical stress or policy uncertainty.\nWhat euro-based investors should watch\nTwo variables dominate: EUR/USD and inflation-adjusted yields. A strong euro can temper gains, but a falling dollar typically boosts the gold price in euro. Watch how ECB guidance and US data shift those drivers. If US growth cools and markets price earlier cuts, the dollar may weaken again, pushing the gold price in euro higher even if dollar quotes pause.\nInto year-end, liquidity thins and bid-ask spreads can widen, especially in smaller bars and coins. That can exaggerate intraday moves relative to the underlying spot. For investors in Germany, set limit orders and compare dealer premiums. Short swings should not distract from the trend if your thesis is intact, but they can affect the gold price in euro on any given day.\nPortfolio uses and risks\nGold can hedge inflation surprises, currency shocks, and equity drawdowns. Many diversified portfolios keep a 5% to 10% sleeve, depending on risk tolerance and horizon. Sizing matters more than timing when the gold price in euro runs hot. Build in steps, review correlations, and avoid leverage. A sensible plan can absorb volatility without turning a hedge into a speculative bet.\nGerman investors can choose physical bars and coins, ETCs like Xetra-Gold, or broad precious-metal funds. Physical holdings add storage costs but no issuer risk. ETCs trade on Xetra with tight spreads in normal hours. Always compare fees, tax treatment, and buyback policies. At current levels, the gold price in euro implies about \u20ac121 per gram (based on \u20ac3,772 per ounce).\nShort-term levels and catalysts\nPrice action revolves around the \u20ac3,772 mark. Holding above \u20ac3,700 keeps momentum intact, while sustained closes below that zone would hint at a pause. Because the gold price in euro reflects both metal and currency, watch EUR/USD alongside spot. If volatility picks up, scale entries and use alerts rather than chasing strength during thin sessions.\nKey catalysts include German inflation data, ECB minutes, and US PCE and jobs figures. Any downside surprise in US growth or inflation could reinforce a weaker dollar and extend the bid. After a year on track for the best performance since 1979, per this source, the bar is high, but dips may still be brief if macro risks linger.\nFinal Thoughts\nToday\u2019s record shows how closely currency and rates shape outcomes for German investors. With the euro price near \u20ac3,772, we see three practical steps. First, watch EUR/USD and real yields; they steer direction more than headlines. Second, plan entries with limits, as thin holiday trading can widen spreads a"

Prices are now closer to the top of this range.\nBefore the holidays, several US economic data releases are due. These numbers could shape market direction toward the end of December and early January, especially since trading liquidity remains low during the Christmas and New Year period.\nIf the data comes in weaker, especially GDP growth, the US dollar could face downward pressure. This would happen even if inflation stays high, as weaker growth would strengthen expectations of interest rate cuts next year.\nAt present, the more likely outcome is that interest rates remain unchanged at the January meeting.\nFed Policy Outlook for Next Year\nThe Federal Reserve ended the year with a 25 basis point interest rate cut as the labor market showed signs of weakness. The Fed has a dual mandate that focuses on price stability and employment. This explains why the easing cycle continues even though inflation remains above the target.\nRecent CPI data offered some relief. Inflation came in below expectations, with an annual reading of 2.7 percent.\nAt the start of the new year, markets usually focus on the labor market, inflation, and key measures of economic growth. If these indicators remain weak, the Federal Reserve may consider more rate cuts than the two currently expected by markets.\nIt is also important to remember that a change in the Fed chair is expected next year. Kevin Hassett is widely seen as the likely successor, and he may support deeper rate cuts. Such an approach would align with the policy preferences of the current US administration.\nGDP and PCE Still to Come Before the Holidays\nTo wrap up this year\u2019s macroeconomic calendar, markets will receive GDP data and the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the PCE index.\nFor GDP, forecasts point to quarter-on-quarter growth staying above 3%. This would be seen as a positive outcome if the data meet expectations.\nSince tomorrow is Christmas Eve, any market moves are likely to happen during today\u2019s session.\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis\nThe key level for the EURUSD pair is the December high around 1.1800. If today\u2019s data supports a weaker US dollar, this level could be broken. That would open the path toward 1.19 in the first weeks of the new year.\nThe uptrend line remains the main limit for any correction. The nearest support sits around 1.17, which was tested at the end of last week.\n****\nBelow are the key ways an InvestingPro subscription can enhance your stock market investing performance:\n- ProPicks AI: AI-managed stock picks every month, with several picks that have already taken off in November and in the long term.\n- Warren AI: Investing.com\u2019s AI tool provides real-time market insights, advanced chart analysis, and personalized trading data to help traders make quick, data-driven decisions.\n- Fair Value: This feature aggregates 17 institutional-grade valuation models to cut through the noise and show you which stocks are overhyped, undervalued, or fairly priced.\n-\n1,200+ Financial Metrics at Your Fingertips: From debt ratios and profitability to analyst earnings revisions, you\u2019ll have everything professional investors use to analyze stocks in one clean dashboard.\n-\nInstitutional-Grade News & Market Insights: Stay ahead of market moves with exclusive headlines and data-driven analysis.\n-\nA Distraction-Free Research Experience: No pop-ups.

                "body": "Gold prices hit record high above $4,500/oz on haven demand, Fed easing bets\nGBP/USD is trading roughly in the 1.3470\u20131.3518 band after a two-day vertical move that took the pair to its highest levels since early October and close to a 12-week high. Buyers stepped in aggressively after the Bank of England moved Bank Rate down by 25 bps to 3.75%, but a narrow 5\u20134 split vote and persistent inflation at 3.2% YoY kept the move from looking like a classic dovish pivot. Four of nine policymakers refused to cut, signalling they still see wage and price pressures as uncomfortably high.\nThat combination \u2013 a small cut, a divided committee, and inflation still 1.2 percentage points above the 2% target \u2013 leaves the market reading the BoE as \u201ceasing, but reluctantly.\u201d The result is that GBP has not been treated as a funding currency. Instead, GBP/USD buyers are comfortable pushing the pair above 1.3400, with spot trading around 1.3450\u20131.3480 after an intraday high at 1.3518 and earlier support test at 1.3374.\nOn the macro side, the UK is not posting strong data, but it is avoiding outright stagnation for now. Third-quarter GDP printed 0.1% QoQ and 1.3% YoY, exactly in line with forecasts. A small downward revision of Q2 growth from 0.2% to 0.1% was offset by an upward tweak to 2024 data, leaving the year-on-year pace unchanged at 1.3%.\nThis is anaemic growth, not a boom, and BoE projections still assume activity \u201ccomes close to stalling\u201d in late 2025 as tighter financial conditions and the recent Budget hit confidence. That weak backdrop caps how far GBP/USD can run purely on domestic strength.\nAt the same time, the UK current account deficit narrowed from about \u00a321.2bn in Q2 to \u00a312.1bn in Q3, still sizeable but less extreme. For a currency that traditionally relies on foreign capital inflows to cover a structural external gap, a smaller deficit removes some of the worst-case tail risk for GBP, but it doesn\u2019t change the reality that the Pound remains vulnerable if global risk appetite sours.\nMarkets now see the 3.75% BoE rate as a staging point, not the terminal level. Inflation has eased from a recent 3.8% peak to 3.2%, but the Governing body itself is guiding toward inflation only converging to 2% around mid-2026. That forces a slow-motion cutting cycle.\nRate markets are pricing additional easing through 2026, but not an aggressive slashing of Bank Rate. The four dissenters on the Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 who opposed the latest cut \u2013 act as a ceiling on how dovish the BoE can turn in the near term. That \u201creluctant easing\u201d stance supports GBP on crosses and provides a fundamental backbone for GBP/USD above 1.34, especially when set against a Federal Reserve that has already slashed 75 bps this year and is being pushed politically toward more.\nOn the other side of the pair, the USD is losing altitude. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has slid into the 97.70\u201398.10 band, locked inside a clear descending channel with a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. Sellers defend the region around 98.60\u201398.70, where a falling trend line and the 50-EMA converge, while the 200-EMA near 99.20 caps any deeper squeeze.\nThe technical structure on the dollar side is cleanly bearish: RSI holds below 45, momentum is negative, and every rally into resistance is being sold. Positioning is increasingly skewed toward further USD downside as the market leans harder into Fed-easing stories and rotates into gold and high-beta FX. That macro dollar drag is one of the main reasons GBP/USD has been able to climb toward 1.35 even though UK growth is mediocre.\nThe Fed has already delivered 75 bps of cuts this year and markets are not convinced it will stop there. Implied probabilities show around a 20% chance of another reduction in January and roughly 50% odds of an additional cut by March. Some houses expect two more 25-bp moves in 2026 \u2013 for example, one in March and one in June \u2013 which would take the cumulative easing even further.\nThe political backdrop is tilting the s"

The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthens against the Greenback on expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will follow a gradual monetary easing path in 2026.\nThe UK central bank delivered a widely expected rate cut to 3.75% last week, but suggested that the bar for further reduction was high, given persistent inflation. Rising bets of a slower BoE monetary easing path could provide some support to the Cable against the US Dollar (USD) in the near term. Money markets believe the BoE will deliver at least one rate cut in the first half of the year, and pricing in nearly a 50% probability of a second before the year-end, according to Reuters.\nOn the other hand, the stronger-than-expected US economic data could underpin the USD and act as a headwind for the major pair. Data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday revealed that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a 4.3% annualized pace in the third quarter (Q3). This reading came in above the market consensus of 3.3% and followed 3.8% growth in Q2.\nFinancial markets are likely to remain quiet ahead of the Christmas holiday. Traders will take more cues from the US Initial Jobless Claims data later in the day. The market consensus was for 223,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 13, compared to 224,000 in the previous reading.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balanc"

GBP/USD is trading around 1.3478, down from its peak since October 1 at roughly 1.3518.\nEarlier, the British Pound had revisited nearly a 12-week high against the Dollar during European trading hours. This was due in part to expectations of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026.\nGbp Usd Momentum\nThe GBP/USD pair continued its positive momentum into a second day, reaching its highest since early October near the 1.3500 mark. This was supported by a generally weaker US Dollar and a favourable technical setup.\nEconomic data showed the US economy expanding at an annualised rate of 4.3% in Q3, surpassing the forecast of 3.3%. This caused a modest rebound for the US Dollar, affecting GBP/USD, which traded just below 1.3500 by the day\u2019s end.\nSimultaneously, gold prices reached $4,497 but retreated slightly following the strong US GDP figures. In the crypto market, Bitcoin remains above the $87,000 support amid ongoing selling pressure impacting Ethereum and Ripple as well.\nWe see the Pound Sterling testing the 1.3500 level against the Dollar, a high not seen since early October. This momentum is largely built on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice in 2026. However, the stronger-than-expected 4.3% annualized US GDP growth for the third quarter introduces some doubt into this narrative.\nYear End Market Dynamics\nThis expectation for Fed easing is fueled by inflation data that has cooled significantly over the past year. We remember how the Core PCE index, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, fell to 3.2% back in late 2023, setting the stage for the current disinflationary trend. On the other hand, the Bank of England may face stickier price pressures, potentially creating a policy divergence that favors Sterling.\nAs we head into the final week of the year, trading volumes are expected to be thin due to the holidays. This low liquidity can exaggerate price movements, making the market vulnerable to sudden swings on any new headlines. For traders, this means any positions should be managed with caution, as seemingly small news can have an outsized impact.\nGiven the clear upward momentum but the risk of a snap-back from the strong US data, using options could be a prudent strategy. Buying call options on GBP/USD allows for participation in any further rally beyond 1.3500 while defining and limiting the maximum risk. This is particularly useful in the current low-liquidity environment where sudden reversals are a distinct possibility."

The AUDUSD pair jumped to a high of 0.6710, up by 13.4% from its lowest point this year.\nRBA and Federal Reserve divergence\nThe AUDUSD exchange rate jumped as investors predicted that the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would continue to diverge in the coming year.\nOn the one hand, economists believe that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates in the coming year. In a statement on Tuesday, Trump hinted that he will only nominate a Fed Chair who will be willing to cut interest rates even as the economic strength continues.\nHis statement was a reaction to the strong US GDP data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Tuesday. That report showed that the economy expanded by 4.3% in Q3, helped by robust consumer spending and AI investment.\nThat growth was much higher than what analysts were expecting by far, meaning that the economy continued to defy gravity this year\nHowever, more data sent a warning about the economy. A good example of this is the consumer confidence report by the Conference Board.\nThe report showed that the country\u2019s consumer confidence dropped sharply this month, continuing a trend that has been going on in the last five months. This is an important number because consumer spending is the biggest part of the GDP.\nWall Street analysts and Polymarket traders expect that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least two times in 2p26\nOn the other hand, analysts are pricing in potential interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia next year after recent data showed that inflation continued rising.\nMinutes released on Tuesday showed that officials deliberated on whether to hike interest rates or not. They opted to leave rates unchanged at 3.6% so that they can observe inflation trends in the country.\nEconomists at some of the biggest Australian banks have a mixed opinion on what to expect next year. Belinda Allen, a top economist at CBA predicted that the bank will hike rate next year.\nOn the other hand, Luci Ellis, a senior analyst at Westpac, sees the bank leaving rates unchanged for an extended period, a move that the bond market supports. Data shows that the ten-year bond yield dropped to 4.75% on Wednesday from this week\u2019s high of 4.83%. The five-year yield dropped slightly to 4.28%.\nAUDUSD technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the AUDUSD exchange rate has been in a strong bull run this year, moving from a low of 0.5912 in April to the current 0.6700, its highest level in over a year.\nIt flipped the important resistance level at 0.6685, its highest point in April into a support level. The pair remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\nAlso, it remains slightly above the Supertrend indicator, a sign that bulls are in control for now. Therefore, the most likely AUDUSD forecast is bullish, with the next key target being the psychological level at 0.6800."

                "body": "AUD/USD gains on RBA Minutes, US data curbs upside\n- The Australian Dollar advances after the release of the RBA Minutes, highlighting more persistent inflation risks\n- RBA policymakers point to a data-dependent approach and do not rule out tighter policy further down the road\n- Stronger-than-expected US data underpin the US Dollar, capping the pair\u2019s upside\nAUD/USD trades around 0.6680 on Tuesday at the time of writing, up 0.40% on the day. However, the pair is slightly off a three-month high of 0.6700 reached earlier in the day, with the pullback triggered by better-than-expected US economic releases that provided fresh support to the US Dollar.\nThe Australian Dollar finds support after the publication of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Minutes from its December monetary policy meeting. The Minutes reveal that board members are becoming less confident that current monetary policy settings remain sufficiently restrictive, as evidence mounts that inflation pressures may prove more persistent than previously expected.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward, noting that several inflation indicators will be released ahead of the February meeting. Policymakers discussed whether a rate increase might be needed at some point in 2026, while stressing that it would take more time to properly assess the persistence of inflationary pressures.\nMarket pricing reflects this cautious stance. Australian 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures for February 2026 imply a relatively low chance of a near-term rate hike, although expectations for tighter policy later on remain in place. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations rose to 4.7% in December from November\u2019s three-month low of 4.5%, reinforcing the RBA\u2019s hawkish bias amid elevated inflation risks.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar draws support from a string of stronger-than-expected macroeconomic releases. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, well above the previous estimate of 3.3% and market expectations of 3.8%. Inflation components of the report also surprised to the upside, with the GDP Price Index rising 3.7% in Q3, while Core Personal Consumption Expenditures increased 2.9%, underscoring persistent price pressures in the US economy.\nLabor market indicators have also contributed to the US Dollar\u2019s resilience. The ADP Employment Change report showed that private sector job growth remained mitigated, reinforcing the view of a still-tight labor market despite signs of moderation elsewhere. Meanwhile, Industrial Production edged lower by 0.1% MoM in October, missing expectations for a modest increase but not enough to derail confidence in the broader economic outlook.\nIn addition, US Consumer Confidence for December fell to 89.1 from 92.9 in the previous month, pointing to some softening in household sentiment amid elevated interest rates and persistent inflation concerns.\nTaken together, these releases have helped the US Dollar stabilize after recent weakness, prompting AUD/USD to retreat modestly from its intraday and three-month highs.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "Key Moments\n- AUD/USD climbed toward 0.6680 as the Australian Dollar outperformed major peers.\n- RBA minutes showed policymakers discussed possible rate hikes in 2026 amid rising inflation risks.\n- Traders awaited the flash US Q3 GDP release at 13:30 GMT, with consensus at 3.2% after 3.8% previously.\nAUD/USD Extends Rally on RBA Minutes\nThe AUD/USD pair continued its gains from Monday, moving toward 0.6680 during the European session on Tuesday. The Australian Dollar outperformed other major currencies, boosted by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes from its December 9 policy meeting. At that meeting, the RBA kept the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.6%.\nThe minutes suggested policymakers no longer consider the current stance restrictive and noted upside risks to inflation. This combination strengthened demand for the Aussie against the US Dollar.\nAustralian Dollar Performance vs Major Currencies\nThe report highlighted that the Australian Dollar was the strongest performer against the US Dollar. A heat map showed percentage changes of major currencies relative to one another, with AUD among the base currencies.\nThe heat map selects the base currency from the left column and the quote currency from the top row. For example, choosing AUD as the base and USD as the quote shows the percentage change for AUD/USD.\nRBA Signals Possible Rate Increases\nThe minutes revealed that RBA policymakers discussed raising interest rates in 2026 due to higher inflation risks. The document stated: \u201cDiscussed whether a rate increase might be needed at some point in 2026, as recent data indicated risks to inflation have increased to the upside.\u201d\nThese comments signaled a potential tighter monetary policy, bolstering hawkish expectations. According to Reuters, interest rate swaps reflected a 27% chance of a rate hike at the RBA\u2019s February meeting, with a full move priced in by June. Additionally, there was a 56% probability of another increase by the end of 2026.\nUS Dollar Weakness Supports AUD/USD\nAlongside RBA support, US Dollar softness helped AUD/USD. The US Dollar Index (DXY), tracking the Greenback against six major peers, was down 0.16%, trading near 98.00. This level is close to last week\u2019s 11-week low of 97.87.\nExpectations for a more dovish Federal Reserve in 2026 weighed on the USD. The CME FedWatch tool showed a 73.8% chance of a rate cut of at least 50 basis points next year.\nMarket Eyes Upcoming US GDP Data\nInvestors focused on the preliminary US GDP reading, scheduled for 13:30 GMT on Tuesday.\nUS GDP Annualized: Definition and Expectations\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes real GDP Annualized quarterly. This metric measures the annualized value of final goods and services produced in the US. Strong GDP readings generally support the USD, while weaker data tend to pressure it.\nRevisions and Market Impact\nThe BEA releases GDP growth in three stages: an initial estimate followed by two revisions. The third release is treated as final. Traders usually react most to the first estimate. An upside surprise tends to support the USD, while a weaker reading pressures it.\nLater revisions are less market-moving, as they rarely change the broader growth picture."

                "body": "A Bank of Japan rate hike and surging Japanese Government Bond yields led to the unthinkable this week. USD/JPY rallied to 157.765 on December 19, while 10-year JGB yields soared to 2.1% on December 22, before dropping to 2.026% on December 23.\nMonetary policy uncertainty, concerns about the coming year\u2019s fiscal budget and likely bond issuances, and intervention warnings clashed. Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama threatened yen interventions for two consecutive days as USD/JPY climbed toward 158. The two days of warnings briefly sent the pair below 156.\nFiscal concerns have festered since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi became the frontrunner to be Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. USD/JPY has risen 8.46% in H2 2025, while 10-year JGB yields have soared 0.60 basis points to 2.1%, the highest since February 1999.\nCrucially, intervention threats overshadowed fiscal concerns and strong US economic data, supporting a bearish USD/JPY outlook. Japanese economic indicators will likely add to the market volatility as the Japanese government and the BoJ grapple with yen stability.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nFollowing the choppy start to the week, the market focus will briefly shift to the Japanese economic calendar on Wednesday, December 24. The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) will give insights into the domestic demand outlook.\nThe LEI rose from 108.2 in September to 110.0 in October, indicating a pickup in business and consumer sentiment. Typically, a higher LEI reading indicates rising business investment, increasing employment, and stronger wage growth.\nHigher wages would boost households\u2019 purchasing power, fueling consumer spending and demand-driven inflation. This chain of events would support a more hawkish BoJ policy stance, strengthening the yen.\nHowever, the weaker yen has pushed import prices higher, dampening households\u2019 purchasing power and curbing private consumption. The effects of higher import prices on private consumption have been a key concern for the BoJ and the Japanese government, leading to yen intervention warnings.\nAn upward revision to the October LEI would align with improving sentiment toward the Japanese economy and strengthen the yen. However, USD/JPY losses will likely be limited, considering the ongoing fiscal concerns and the BoJ\u2019s cautious policy outlook and fading bets on a March Fed rate cut.\nAn unexpected surge in US GDP growth and a hotter-than-expected US price deflator tempered expectations of a March rate cut on Tuesday. A sharp increase in PCE prices signaled a sticky inflation outlook, while concerns mount about a decoupling of the labor market from GDP growth.\nLater on Wednesday, initial jobless claims will come under scrutiny after last week\u2019s weak US jobs report. Economists forecast initial jobless claims to slip from 224k (week ending December 13) to 223k (week ending December 20).\nA lower claims reading would ease immediate concerns about the labor market, while supporting a more hawkish Fed policy stance. However, an unexpected spike in claims could revive Fed rate cut bets, supporting a bearish USD/JPY price outlook.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut dropped from 52.9% on December 22 to 45.1% on December 23. The sharp drop reflected the impact of the Q3 US GDP report on sentiment toward the Fed policy stance.\nWhile US data will influence US dollar demand and USD/JPY trends, risks of a yen carry trade unwind linger ahead of the holidays.\nElevated JGB and rising US Treasury yields will likely shift focus back to USD/JPY trends for early warning signs of an unwind. However, economists have mixed views on the USD/JPY\u2019s breaking point. 10-year JGB yields could boost demand from domestic investors. The prospect of a stronger yen on repatriations and higher yields reinforces the constructive short- to medium-term bias.\nA drop below 155 coul"

Minutes of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) October meeting showed that board members debated the need to continue raising interest rates. Apart from this, geopolitical uncertainties stemming from rising US-Venezuela tensions, the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, and the risk of a renewed Israel-Iran conflict contribute to safe-haven JPY's outperformance.\nMeanwhile, the BoJ's hawkish outlook marks a significant divergence in comparison to bets for further policy easing by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The latter drags the US Dollar (USD) to its lowest level since early October and also benefits the lower-yielding JPY. However, the upbeat market mood acts as a headwind for the JPY and assists the USD/JPY pair to find support ahead of mid-155.00s. The fundamental backdrop, however, favor of the JPY bulls and warrants caution before positioning for any meaningful USD/JPY recovery.\nJapanese Yen retains bullish bias amid BoJ rate hike bets and flight to safety\n- Minutes of the Bank of Japan's October meeting, released earlier this Wednesday, showed that board members agreed that the central bank will continue raising interest rates if economic price forecasts materialize. At the subsequent meeting in December, the central bank raised the policy rate to 0.75%, or a 30-year high, and left the door open to further tightening.\n- Moreover, tensions linked to the United States' actions against vessels carrying Venezuelan oil, along with Russia's escalation of attacks on Ukraine and a potential new Israel-Iran war, underpin the safe-haven Japanese Yen for the third consecutive day. Apart from this, the prevalent US Dollar selling bias drags the USD/JPY pair to a fresh weekly low on Wednesday.\n- The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, has declined to a fresh low since early October amid rising bets for two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026. Moreover, US President Donald Trump declared that the candidate for the role of the Fed Chair must commit to lowering rates even when the economy is performing well.\n- This overshadows Tuesday's upbeat US GDP growth figures, which showed that the economy expanded at a 4.3% annualized pace during the July\u2013September period. The reading was stronger than consensus estimates and the 3.8% rise recorded in the previous quarter, though it does little to provide any respite to the USD bulls or help ease the prevalent selling bias.\n- Separately, the US Census Bureau reported that Durable Goods Orders declined 2.2% in October, following the 0.7% increase recorded in the previous month and worse than the market expectation for a decrease of 1.5%. Furthermore, a sharp fall in consumer confidence in December suggested that households are becoming much more cautious about the future.\n- Traders now look forward to Wednesday's release of the US Initial Weekly Jobless Claims, which might influence the USD and provide some impetus to the USD/JPY pair later during the North American session. The focus, however, will remain glued to Friday's release of the Tokyo CPI report, which could play a key role in driving the JPY demand in the near term.\nUSD/JPY bearish technical setup backs the case for a further depreciation\nThe USD/JPY pair has now reversed the post-BoJ strong move up back closer to the November swing high. Moreover, the weekly downtrend from the vicinity of the 158.00 mark constitutes the formation of a bearish double-top pattern a"

                "body": "The US Dollar receives support from better-than-expected macroeconomic data, including a GDP growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the previous estimate of 3.3%. Despite this robust data, USD/JPY trades lower at approximately 156.40, reflecting a 0.40% decrease on the day due to a stronger Japanese Yen.\nConsumer confidence in the US dips to 89.1 in December from a previous 92.9, showing household sentiment softening amidst inflation and high interest rates. Meanwhile, the labour market remains tight, with modest private job growth as reported by the ADP Employment Change, while Industrial Production slightly declines by 0.1%.\nJapanese Yen Rally Driven By Intervention Expectations\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s rally is attributed to expectations of potential intervention by Japanese authorities to counter rapid devaluation. Statements from Japan\u2019s Finance Minister suggest readiness to act against erratic currency moves, contributing to a stronger Yen even as the Bank of Japan adopts a cautious monetary approach.\nUSD maintains mixed performance against other major currencies, showing a 0.16% and 0.17% decline against the Euro and Pound respectively. The Yen strengthens against several currencies, reflecting the market\u2019s anticipation of possible Japanese intervention and the BoJ\u2019s cautious rate policy approach.\nGiven the tension in USD/JPY, we are seeing a classic conflict between strong US economic fundamentals and the risk of Japanese intervention. The pair\u2019s current position around 156.40 suggests the market is pricing in the intervention threat more heavily than the wide interest rate differential. This is a fragile balance, especially heading into the low-liquidity holiday period.\nUS Economic Data And Intervention Risks\nWe should note that last week\u2019s final November Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data in the US came in at 3.2%, slightly above consensus and reinforcing the Federal Reserve\u2019s position to keep rates elevated into 2026. This fundamental support for the dollar provides a floor for the pair, making a sustained drop difficult without official action from Japan. The high US GDP growth of 4.3% in the third quarter further solidifies this view of economic divergence.\nOn the other side of the trade, this morning\u2019s Tokyo Core CPI for December showed inflation persisting at 2.8%, keeping some pressure on the Bank of Japan. However, the market believes the more immediate threat is direct intervention from the Ministry of Finance, not a sudden change in BoJ policy. We are treating the verbal warnings from officials as a serious signal of their discomfort with the Yen\u2019s weakness.\nLooking at market positioning, the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders report shows speculative net short positions on the Yen remain historically large. This makes the currency pair highly susceptible to a short squeeze if Japan does intervene, which could cause a rapid drop of several hundred pips. Therefore, we believe buying short-dated USD/JPY put options is a prudent strategy to hedge against a sudden downside move over the coming weeks.\nWe remember the playbook from the interventions in late 2022, where verbal warnings escalated before the Ministry of Finance acted to push the pair down from the 150-152 level. The current environment feels similar, so we are watching for any signs of \u201crate checks\u201d by the BoJ as a potential final signal before action. This historical precedent suggests that even though the fundamental case for a strong dollar is clear, ignoring the intervention risk would be a mistake."

In this period, the Gross Domestic Product Price Index was up 3.7%, compared to the market forecast of 2.7%.\nThe US Dollar may stay under pressure, as analysts warn that strong headline GDP figures may overstate underlying economic health, with growth driven largely by healthcare spending and inventory drawdowns, alongside signs of labor market softening and weaker US consumer confidence in December.\nStatistics Canada\u2019s flash GDP estimate showed the economy expanded 0.1% in November, rebounding modestly from October\u2019s 0.3% contraction, easing near-term growth concerns and reducing pressure for immediate policy easing.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) finds support as the Bank of Canada (BoC) held the overnight rate at 2.25% and signaled a data-dependent pause rather than further cuts, keeping short-term policy settings relatively tight.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern "

Early data pointed to modest growth in November, suggesting the slowdown may be stabilizing. Globally, investors were in a \u201crisk-on\u201d mood as US stocks rose and Treasury yields firmed after strong US growth data, which tends to support risk-sensitive currencies like Canada\u2019s. Oil added a tailwind..\n\u2013 crude prices rose on supply-disruption concerns, and energy exports are a big part of Canada\u2019s trade.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate spreads can overpower ugly data.\nCanadian yields fell and the curve flattened, but the Canada\u2013US 10-year yield gap has narrowed a lot versus recent years. When the US yield advantage shrinks, foreign investors have less incentive to park money in US assets \u2013 which can support the loonie, especially when broader risk appetite is improving.\nThe bigger picture: Small economies live and die by global tides.\nBank of Canada officials have signaled they\u2019re not locked into either hiking or cutting next, because the inflation and growth outlook is still murky. The currency\u2019s resilience is a reminder that for trade-linked economies, global growth, commodity prices, and US financial conditions can drive markets as much as \u2013 or more than \u2013 domestic data for long stretches.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Spot prices, however, remain within striking distance of the highest level since August 2008, touched on Monday. Moreover, the fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for any meaningful corrective decline.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) gets a minor lift following the release of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) October policy meeting Minutes, which showed a broad agreement that the central bank should continue raising rates if economic price forecasts materialize. At the subsequent meeting in December, the BoJ raised the policy rate to 0.75%, or a 30 year high, and left the door open to further tightening. This, along with persistent geopolitical uncertainties, benefits the JPY's safe-haven status and exerts some pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nMeanwhile, the British Pound (GBP) draws support from the Bank of England's (BoE) hawkish rate cut last Thursday. A close 5-4 MPC vote split to lower the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75% pointed to differences within the committee, especially after last week's inflation surprise. This, in turn, forced investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing next year, which acts as a tailwind for the GBP. Apart from this, a positive risk tone might cap the JPY and support the GBP/JPY cross.\nHence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that spot prices have topped out in the near term and placing aggressive bearish bets amid the year-end thin trading. Traders now look to BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's speech on Thursday for cues about the future policy path. Apart from this, Friday's release of Tokyo CPI, along with other important macro data from Japan, will play a key role in influencing the near-term JPY price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/JPY cross.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings\nThe asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion."

BTC has attempted to stabilize after recent pullbacks, yet demand from exchange-traded fund investors appears uneven.\nDespite this hesitation, BlackRock continues to highlight Bitcoin as a core long-term allocation, signaling confidence that extends beyond short-term price swings.\nSponsoredBitcoin Seems To Be A BlackRock Favorite\nBlackRock has included its spot Bitcoin ETF among its three primary investment themes for 2025. The decision reflects long-term conviction rather than short-term trading momentum. While Bitcoin experienced sharp price fluctuations this year, capital flows into the ETF remain substantial.\nWant more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya\u2019s Daily Crypto Newsletter here.\nYear-to-date net inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF stand at approximately $29.6 billion. Cumulative net inflows have reached $62.5 billion since launch. These figures underscore sustained institutional interest, helping explain why BlackRock continues to highlight Bitcoin within its strategic outlook despite market volatility.\nSponsoredBitcoin Is Doing Well In The Futures Market\nShort-term ETF trends present a contrasting picture. Bitcoin ETFs have recorded outflows on roughly half of the trading days over the past month. This pattern indicates cooling demand among some investors, particularly those with shorter time horizons.\nOn Monday, Bitcoin ETFs collectively registered $142 million in net outflows. The decline highlights hesitation amid price uncertainty. While long-term capital remains committed, near-term flows suggest investors are cautious, waiting for clearer signals before increasing exposure.\nDerivatives data adds another layer to the outlook. Despite uneven spot demand, perpetual futures positioning is expanding. With Bitcoin recently trading back above $90,000, perpetual open interest increased from 304,000 BTC to 310,000 BTC, a roughly 2% rise.\nSponsoredFunding rates have also climbed, moving from 0.04% to 0.09%. This combination suggests renewed leveraged long positioning. Traders appear to be positioning for a potential year-end move, increasing risk appetite even as spot demand remains mixed.\nRising open interest alongside higher funding often reflects growing optimism. However, it also increases sensitivity to volatility. If price momentum weakens, leveraged positions can unwind quickly, amplifying short-term swings.\nSponsoredBTC Price Could Register Gains In The Short-Term\nBitcoin trades near $87,400 at the time of writing, sitting just below the $88,210 resistance. Technical structure suggests room for an upside attempt. Short-term momentum could improve if buyers defend current levels and broader sentiment stabilizes.\nSeasonal factors may influence price action. The Christmas trading week has historically brought increased inflows and reduced liquidity. If demand improves, Bitcoin could push toward $90,308, supported by leveraged positioning and renewed investor interest.\nDownside risks remain if optimism fails to materialize. A breakdown below $86,247 would weaken the recovery structure. In that scenario, Bitcoin could slide toward $84,698. Such a move would invalidate the bullish thesis and reinforce near-term caution despite long-term institutional support."

But volatility remains high, with 5-10% swings common.\nThis article outlines key factors to weigh before investing in smart-contract tokens, helping you balance opportunity and risk.\nNetwork Fundamentals and Scalability\nSmart-contract assets thrive on network strength. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake shift cut energy use 99%, with layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum pushing 100,000 TPS. Upgrades like Pectra enhance efficiency, supporting $51.9 billion DeFi TVL.\nScalability is crucial. Congestion during peaks raises fees, deterring users. Platforms addressing this, like Ethereum\u2019s rollups, attract developers \u2013 3,000+ active on Cardano alone.\nCheck adoption metrics. Active addresses, TVL growth, and transaction volume signal health. Ethereum\u2019s 120 million ETH supply and 65% staking participation show maturity.\nUtility and Real-World Adoption\nUtility drives long-term value. Ethereum powers lending (Aave), stablecoins (USDT), and NFTs, with $3.2 billion XRPL DeFi TVL. Partnerships like Ethiopia\u2019s digital IDs add economic activity.\nReal-world use matters. Tokenized assets on blockchain hit $10 billion, with institutions exploring RWAs. This ties price to tangible growth, reducing speculation.\nAssess ecosystem. Developer activity (3,000+ on Ethereum) and partnerships forecast adoption. Strong utility cushions volatility.\nRisks: Volatility, Regulation, and Competition\nVolatility is inherent. ETH\u2019s 5-10% swings demand discipline \u2013 80% of traders lose chasing highs. Leverage amplifies this; use 3x-5x max.\nRegulation looms. SEC scrutiny on staking yields or ETF delays can trigger 10-20% drops. Clarity boosts confidence, as seen in 2024 approvals.\nCompetition challenges dominance. Solana\u2019s speed or Cardano\u2019s governance draw users. Ethereum\u2019s 60% DeFi share holds, but erosion risks value.\nInvestor Behavior and Market Sentiment\nSentiment drives short-term moves. Fear & Greed at 26 signals caution, with 60% favoring defensives. On-chain: 70% long-term holders show conviction.\nInstitutional inflows matter. $13 billion ETF volume reflects confidence, cushioning dips. Retail\u2019s 4.5 million wallets add liquidity but FOMO.\nCopy trading helps. Mirror pros with 80% win rates on catalysts, automating buys at support. Choose low-drawdown (under 10%) for safety.\nConclusion\nAdding smart-contract assets like ETH offers exposure to DeFi\u2019s $51.9 billion TVL and scalable innovation, with 25% YTD gains signaling potential. But volatility, regulation, and competition demand caution \u2013 80% lose without strategy.\nAllocate 5-10%, use 3x leverage, and cap risk at 1-2%. Monitor upgrades and TVL. Copy trading aligns you with pros\u2019 timing. In 2025\u2019s blockchain shift, these assets reward research \u2013 balance utility with discipline for resilient growth."

In a bold two-day maneuver, London-based investment firm Fasanara Capital acquired a staggering 6,569 Ethereum (ETH). This isn\u2019t just a simple buy-and-hold. Data from Lookonchain reveals a sophisticated DeFi strategy at play, sparking intense discussion about institutional tactics and market sentiment. Let\u2019s break down what this Fasanara Capital ETH purchase truly means for the ecosystem.\nWhat Does Fasanara Capital\u2019s Massive ETH Move Signal?\nWhen a major institutional player makes a move of this scale, it demands attention. Fasanara Capital didn\u2019t just buy ETH; they deployed it strategically into the Morpho lending protocol. There, they used their newly acquired Ethereum as collateral to borrow 13 million USDC. This action is a classic DeFi leveraging strategy. It suggests the firm is potentially recycling capital to fund even more ETH acquisitions, amplifying their position without committing additional fiat capital upfront.\nThis approach highlights a mature, calculated entry into the digital asset space. It\u2019s not speculative frenzy; it\u2019s strategic accumulation. The move demonstrates deep familiarity with decentralized finance tools, positioning Fasanara not just as an investor, but as an active participant in the Ethereum economy.\nDecoding the Strategy: Why Use Morpho and Borrow USDC?\nTo understand the impact of the Fasanara Capital ETH purchase, we must look at the mechanics. By depositing ETH into Morpho and borrowing stablecoins, the firm achieves several objectives:\n- Maintaining Exposure: They keep their ETH holdings, benefiting from any potential future price appreciation.\n- Generating Liquidity: The borrowed USDC provides immediate capital that can be redeployed.\n- Cost-Efficiency: This can be a lower-cost method to increase buying power compared to traditional financing.\nThe choice of Morpho is also significant. As a lending protocol that optimizes rates between lenders and borrowers, it indicates a focus on capital efficiency. This entire operation is a masterclass in using DeFi primitives for sophisticated treasury management.\nWhat Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum and Crypto Markets?\nThis transaction is a substantial data point for market analysts. A single entity accumulating over 6,500 ETH in a short timeframe reduces available supply on exchanges, which can impact market dynamics. More importantly, it serves as a powerful sentiment indicator. Institutional players like Fasanara Capital conduct extensive due diligence. Their commitment suggests a strong, research-backed belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value proposition.\nFurthermore, their comfort with complex DeFi interactions validates the entire Ethereum application layer. It signals that institutional capital is becoming increasingly adept at navigating the decentralized landscape, moving beyond simple spot purchases on centralized exchanges.\nKey Takeaways from This Institutional Crypto Play\nThe Fasanara Capital ETH purchase offers clear lessons for observers and participants alike:\n- Institutional Sophistication is Growing: Moves are no longer just about buying Bitcoin. They involve layered strategies within the DeFi ecosystem.\n- Ethereum as Collateral: ETH\u2019s role as premier collateral asset in DeFi is being embraced by traditional finance.\n- Strategy Over Speculation: This was a calculated financial engineering move, not a mere bet on price.\nIn conclusion, Fasanara Capital\u2019s recent activity is a compelling narrative of institutional adoption evolving into institutional integration. It showcases a future where traditional investment firms seamlessly utilize decentralized protocols to execute complex strategies. This Fasanara Capital ETH purchase and subsequent leverag"

                "body": "Key Takeaways\nBitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) quietly crossed a threshold that few Ethereum observers ever expected a single corporate entity to approach.\nAccording to its Dec. 22 holdings update , BitMine now controls around 4.1 million ETH, representing 3.37% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply of roughly 120.7 million ETH. At current prices, that stake alone is worth over $12 billion, making BitMine the most extensive Ethereum treasury in the world and the second-largest crypto treasury globally, behind Strategy Inc.\u2019s Bitcoin holdings.\nLed by Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee , BitMine has openly stated its goal: reach 5% of all ETH in existence, a milestone Lee has dubbed the \u201calchemy of 5%.\u201d If achieved, BitMine would hold nearly 6 million ETH, a level of concentration that would rival or exceed most decentralized staking pools and reshape Ethereum\u2019s economic and governance environment.\nThe development raises an unavoidable question: Does one company holding more than 3%, and potentially 5%, of ETH threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralization?\nThe answer is not straightforward.\nBitMine\u2019s accumulation has been both rapid and unprecedented. In just 5.5 months, the company surpassed 4 million ETH , adding nearly 100,000 ETH in a single week leading up to its December disclosure. Its treasury now consists of:\nIn total, BitMine\u2019s crypto, cash, and equity holdings stand at $13.2 billion.\nWhat makes this accumulation especially notable is not just its size, but also its liquidity and accessibility. BMNR is now one of the most actively traded stocks in the U.S., averaging $1.7 billion in daily trading volume, ranking 66th nationwide, ahead of Chevron and just behind Wells Fargo. That liquidity allows BitMine to continuously raise capital and expand its ETH position with minimal friction.\nIn effect, BitMine has become a Wall Street-native vehicle for acquiring ETH, bridging traditional equity markets with Ethereum accumulation at scale.\nEthereum\u2019s supply dynamics already lean toward scarcity. Since the merge to proof-of-stake and the implementation of fee burning, ETH issuance has slowed significantly, resulting in periods of net deflation.\nBitMine\u2019s accumulation compounds this effect.\nRemoving over 4 million ETH from liquid circulation tightens exchange supply, reduces order book depth, and increases sensitivity to marginal demand. If BitMine reaches its 5% target, the removal of nearly 6 million ETH could materially alter Ethereum\u2019s market structure.\nHistorically, cryptocurrency markets have responded predictably to supply constraints. Bitcoin\u2019s institutional accumulation between 2020 and 2021, driven by corporate treasuries and ETFs, helped fuel one of the largest bull markets in its history. Ethereum could experience a similar dynamic.\nHowever, scarcity cuts both ways. While reduced supply can accelerate price appreciation, it also amplifies volatility. With fewer coins available, price moves become sharper, and market reactions to unexpected selling or macro shocks can be more violent.\nScarcity creates upside, but it also concentrates risk.\nNo. Token ownership alone is not the same as consensus control on Ethereum.\nEthereum operates under a proof-of-stake model. Network security and transaction finality depend on validators that actively stake ETH and participate in consensus by voting on checkpoints. Finality requires broad participation across the validator set, not merely large token balances held in reserve.\nTwo practical implications follow from this design.\nAs a result, BitMine\u2019s reported holdings represent a concentration of ownership, not proof of centralized control over Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model turns ETH into more than a speculative asset; it is also productive capital. Large holders can stake ETH to earn a yield while participating in the network\u2019s consensus.\nBitMine has already announced plans for its own staking infrastructure, the Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN), expected to launch "

                "body": "Solana ETFs Surge to $750M as Investors Largely Ignore Volatility\nSpot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to attract investor interest since their launch in the United States on October 28. According to data, spot Solana ETFs have posted $750.10 million in cumulative net inflows as of December 22, with outflows recorded on only three trading days since launch.\nAll of those outflows were relatively small, and each was less than $33 million, despite the intense, choppy price action in the last quarter of the year.\nSolana Ecosystem Growth\nCoinShares explained that the consistent inflows mean that investors are using regulated investment vehicles to gain exposure to Solana rather than rotating capital out shortly after launch, a pattern that has previously affected some crypto-linked products. Market participants see the trend as an indication that Solana is increasingly being viewed as a long-term allocation rather than a short-term trade, especially as its ecosystem activity and infrastructure continue to expand, despite earlier concerns about decentralization.\nAlongside ETF-related developments, Solana\u2019s validator infrastructure has also seen rapid adoption of new performance-focused technology. As of November 10, 2025, around 24.2% of Solana validators are running Frankendancer, a hybrid validator client that combines elements of the existing Agave client with components from Jump Crypto\u2019s Firedancer project. This is a sharp increase from just six validators using the software in January 2025.\nData cited by CoinShares show that validators operating Frankendancer are earning higher average fees and tips than those running Agave alone. This essentially reflects improved performance and transaction processing efficiency.\nAdditionally, Solana validators are increasingly adopting DoubleZero, a dedicated private mesh network designed to improve communication between validators by bypassing parts of the public internet. As of November, 290 validators representing roughly 36% of total staked SOL are connected through DoubleZero. Such a level of adoption highlights growing demand for lower latency and more reliable transaction propagation across the network.\nStablecoins on Solana\nThe infrastructure upgrades come as activity on Solana continues to rise. Stablecoin usage on the blockchain has also expanded sharply over the past two years. In fact, the total value of stablecoins circulating on the network has increased from about $1.8 billion in early 2024 to roughly $12 billion by November 2025, as per on-chain data.\nYou may also like:\n- Ethereum Stablecoin Shift: B2B Volume Jumps 156%, P2B Payments Up 167%\n- Binance Hits 300M Registered Accounts 8 Years After Launch \u2013 Key Drivers Behind the Growth\n- World Liberty Financial Proposes 5% Treasury Allocation to Support USD1 Growth\nUSDC accounts for the largest share, followed by USDT. Meanwhile, newer entrants such as PayPal\u2019s PYUSD and Paxos-issued USDG are also gaining traction. The rapid growth in stablecoin supply points to Solana\u2019s increasing role in payments, trading, and settlement activity, as well as its appeal to companies seeking faster and lower-cost blockchain infrastructure."

                "body": "Solana had a wild 2025 as the chain where degens moved fastest and institutional capital followed at scale.\nMarket Overview\nWe are in the final days of a year in which Solana started as the wild guy of crypto, stoking up meme coin fever to mad levels and nearly hitting $300 as SOL (\nSOL) tapped a new all-time high. By year-end, it dropped the crypto bro attitude, got a suit like Rent Boy at the end of Trainspotting, and started making eyes at the TradFi bros. Of course, it kept the shades!\nThe\nbiggest Breakpoint conference to date concluded on Dec. 13 in futuristic Abu Dhabi after a three-day affair with a flashy drone show, a $250,000 crypto airdrop raining down from the desert sky, and a slew of announcements that amplified the message that Solana is growing up, and stepping up.\nFor the second year in a row, Solana won the chain wars,\ncapturing nearly 27% of global attention across chain-specific crypto narratives in 2025.\nWith this mindshare came the inevitable tsunami of scammers and hackers, stealing over $250M from Solana users in H1 2025, accounting for 15% of all crypto losses (excluding the Bybit hack).\nThe Solana ecosystem\u2019s\nmarket cap slipped 47% YTD from $330 billion to $173 billion. Trading volume performed in the same fashion, tanking 90% to just below $11 billion.\nBut Solana\u2019s year was wrapped in key and very bullish milestones that could make Solana great again in 2026. (Please don\u2019t meme that, Donald.)\nTop Solana Stories of 2025\n1. Solana ETFs Approved!\n#WenSOLETF? That was the refrain heard across Crypto Twitter all year. The launch of U.S. spot Solana\nETFs in late November and corporate treasury\nallocations legitimized Solana in traditional capital markets.\nSince receiving SEC approval, several spot Solana ETFs launched in the U.S. in late 2025, with major ones like\nBitwise (BSOL) on NYSE and\n21Shares (TSOL) on Cboe BZX starting trading after passing final regulatory steps and overcoming a government shutdown delay, making SOL accessible to U.S. investors through regulated products. Despite this, the price of Solana\u2019s native asset kept sliding.\nHowever, TradFi is taking note: Treasury firms have staked at least 12.5 million SOL, accounting for more than\n3% of its current supply. With nearly $750M in AUM and sustained inflows, ETFs fundamentally changed SOL\u2019s investor base, liquidity profile, and institutional legitimacy.\n2. Stablecoin and RWA Adoption Accelerates\nSolana emerged as the leading chain for tokenized real-world assets as its\nreal-world assets (RWA) growth outpaced Ethereum.\nBlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund, on-chain treasuries, and tokenized equities proved Solana could host regulated, institutional-grade financial products at scale.\nStablecoin adoption on Solana. Source:\nDeFiLlama\nStablecoin adoption has been a massive driver this year, and Solana\u2019s\nstablecoin supply rose significantly in 2025 to reach nearly $17 billion. Key TradFi giants such as\nWestern Union are planning to or have already launched their stablecoins on Solana.\n3. The Presidential Meme Coin Shock\nDonald Trump's\nreelection as U.S. President ignited the crypto base, with Solana hitting its peak just a day before Trump's inauguration. The surge was driven\nin part by the launch of the TRUMP (\nTRUMP) meme coin,\nthe controversial Melania (\nMELANIA) coin, and copycats on the network.\n4. Pump.fun\u2019s $1.3B ICO\nPump.fun changed crypto this year forever, breaking down the barriers to token creation and becoming a factory for churning out new meme tokens, of which 99% soon went to zero. It was without a doubt one of the most\ninfluential crypto apps in 2025.\nSource: Nano Banana\nIts sold-out PUMP (\nPUMP) ICO, launched months after its crazy ascent,\nraised $600 million in 12 minutes.\nPump.fun cemented Solana\u2019s dominance in token launches and retail trading infrastructure, while also creating ongoing tensions between speculation, fairness, and sustainability. With a huge war chest in a muted market, it will be interesting to see what its next moves will"

SOL has since traded cautiously, awaiting stronger confirmation.\nRecent on-chain and institutional activity suggests investors are positioning for a rebound, potentially setting the stage for renewed price strength into year-end or early January.\nSponsoredSolana Holders Have The ETF Leash\nSolana\u2019s ecosystem is introducing a novel catalyst through on-chain \u201cCreator ETFs,\u201d also known as Bands, launched via Bands.fun. These products differ from traditional exchange-traded products. They operate directly on the Solana blockchain as programmable portfolios curated by creators, analysts, or influencers.\nCreator ETFs can bundle tokens or NFTs and rebalance automatically based on a predefined rule. Increased adoption could lift on-chain activity and transaction volume. Higher network usage often supports price recovery by strengthening demand for SOL as a utility asset.\nInstitutions See Potential\nExchange balance data adds another constructive signal. Solana balances on centralized exchanges have dropped sharply over the past 10 days. During this period, investors accumulated roughly 2.65 million SOL, valued at $345 million.\nDeclining exchange balances typically indicate accumulation rather than distribution. Holders appear willing to move assets into self-custody, reducing immediate sell pressure. This behavior suggests confidence in Solana\u2019s longer-term outlook and supports the case for stabilization following recent weakness.\nWant more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya\u2019s Daily Crypto Newsletter here.\nSponsoredInstitutional sentiment toward Solana remains resilient despite broader market uncertainty. CoinShares\u2019 weekly report shows SOL attracted $48.5 million in inflows for the week ending December 20. Month-to-date inflows now stand at $117.6 million.\nThese allocations indicate sustained institutional interest. Professional investors often accumulate during consolidation phases. Continued inflows can help offset retail selling and provide a foundation for recovery when market conditions improve.\nSOL Price Is Aiming At Recovery\nSolana trades near $124 at the time of writing, sitting below the $126 resistance. The combination of on-chain innovation, exchange outflows, and institutional inflows could support a recovery attempt by late December or early January.\nA break above $126 would be an initial confirmation. Reclaiming $130 would further strengthen sentiment. The key upside target sits near $136. Clearing this level would signal progress toward recouping losses recorded earlier this month.\nDownside risks persist if selling resumes or broader markets weaken. Solana\u2019s price dropping below $123 could expose the $118 support. Losing that level would invalidate the bullish thesis and delay any recovery driven by ecosystem or institutional catalysts."

                "body": "Update: Dec. 23, 2025 | Around 1:37 p.m. ET\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stayed in striking distance of recent highs on Tuesday as investors digested a stronger-than-expected (but delayed) U.S. GDP report, a fresh drop in consumer confidence, and shifting expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026\u2014against a backdrop of thinning liquidity in a holiday-shortened week.\nAs of 1:39 p.m. ET, the Dow hovered at 48,497.85, up 135.17 points (+0.28%). The S&P 500 was also higher at 6,904.99 (+0.39%), while the Nasdaq Composite rose to 23,530.35 (+0.43%). The Dow\u2019s day range so far: 48,254.31 to 48,527.50, with a previous close of 48,362.68. [1]\nDow Jones at 1:37 p.m. ET: A market holding its gains, not chasing them\nTuesday\u2019s action had the feel of late December trading: constructive, but selective. The Dow\u2019s move\u2014moderately higher, but not explosive\u2014reflected a market balancing two competing messages:\n- Growth looked stronger than expected in Q3, which can support earnings optimism.\n- Rates and inflation signals still matter, especially for what the Fed does next\u2014and when.\nWith U.S. equity markets heading into an early close on Wednesday and a full closure Thursday for Christmas, even modest headline surprises can move prices more than usual. [2]\nWhat\u2019s moving the Dow today: AI strength, banks, and the \u201cpoint impact\u201d effect\nOne reason the Dow can feel jumpy\u2014especially intraday\u2014is its price-weighted structure: higher-priced stocks can swing the index more than similarly sized companies with lower share prices.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia and JPMorgan Chase were highlighted among the biggest point contributors to the Dow\u2019s advance, together accounting for a sizable chunk of the index\u2019s rise. MarketWatch noted that each $1 move in a Dow component can translate into roughly 6.16 points on the index\u2014making leadership from a handful of names especially noticeable. [3]\nIn the broader market, investors continued to gravitate toward AI- and mega-cap tech-linked winners, a theme that has repeatedly pulled major U.S. indexes off short pullbacks in 2025. Reuters described the latest stretch as tech/AI extending gains for a fourth session after last week\u2019s selloff. [4]\nThe macro catalyst: Delayed Q3 GDP comes in hot\u2014and pushes yields up\nThe day\u2019s headline macro story was the delayed U.S. Q3 GDP report showing the economy grew at a 4.3% annualized pace, well above the 3.3% consensus in a Reuters poll\u2014powered by robust consumer spending. [5]\nThat strength mattered immediately for rates. As investors absorbed the growth print, Treasury yields rose\u2014a reminder that \u201cgood news\u201d on growth can sometimes cool enthusiasm for rapid Fed easing. Reuters\u2019 global markets wrap described yields rising after the GDP surprise and linked the move to expectations the Fed may pause at its January meeting. [6]\nBehind the headline GDP figure, Reuters detailed a consumer-led story: consumer spending accelerated, and corporate profits strengthened\u2014but inflation also firmed in the quarter, complicating the policy picture. [7]\nThe counterweight: Consumer confidence falls and factory output stalls\nWhile GDP grabbed the spotlight, Tuesday\u2019s \u201csecond read\u201d data leaned softer:\n- U.S. consumer confidence fell to 89.1 in December (vs. 91.0 expected), with the Conference Board citing concerns that still cluster around prices/inflation, trade/tariffs, and politics\u2014along with heightened mentions of jobs and personal finances. [8]\n- U.S. factory (manufacturing) production was unchanged in November, following a decline in October, with motor vehicle output easing\u2014another sign that parts of the economy remain uneven. [9]\nThis mix\u2014strong past-quarter growth, but shakier real-time sentiment and production\u2014helped explain why the Dow\u2019s rally looked more like a measured grind higher than a breakout surge.\nFed outlook and forecasts: The market still sees 2026 cuts\u2014just not as quickly\nInvestors didn\u2019t abandon the idea of 2026 easing after the GDP surprise\u2014but they did reprice the timing"

                "body": "US stocks wobbly at open as GDP surprise dampens Fed rate cut hopes\nUS stocks were wobbly at market open on Tuesday after delayed economic data showed the American economy grew far faster than previously estimated, prompting investors to reassess expectations for future interest-rate cuts.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 53 points, or about 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hovered around the flatline, reflecting a cautious response to the stronger-than-expected data.\nGDP surprise alters market tone\nThe Commerce Department reported that the US economy expanded at a 4.3% annualised pace in the third quarter, sharply above the 3.2% estimate forecast by economists polled by Dow Jones.\nThe report had originally been scheduled for release on October 30 but was delayed due to the record-breaking US government shutdown.\nIt also replaced a second estimate that had been set for release in late November, with one final revision still due from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe upside surprise in growth appeared to unsettle investors who had been positioning for further monetary easing.\nFollowing the data release, fed funds futures traders slightly increased bets that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates unchanged at its January and March meetings, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThe shift reflected growing scepticism that policymakers will move quickly to cut rates in early 2026 if economic momentum remains firm.\nSpending and government activity drive growth\nDetails of the report showed that consumer spending expanded by 3.5% in the third quarter, accelerating from a 2.5% increase in the previous period.\nIncreases in exports and government spending also contributed to the stronger growth outcome, while a smaller-than-expected decline in private fixed investment helped support overall output.\nA closely watched measure known as real final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 which strips out inventories, trade and government spending \u2014 rose 3% during the quarter, up 0.1 percentage point from the prior period.\nFederal Reserve officials monitor this figure for insight into underlying consumer demand, and the increase suggested household activity remained resilient despite tighter financial conditions.\nMarkets digest recent gains\nTuesday\u2019s muted trading followed a strong prior session, when the S&P 500 logged its third straight gain.\nThe index was lifted by a 1.5% jump in Nvidia and advances in Micron Technology and Oracle. Ten of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors closed higher, led by materials and financials.\nIn that session, materials stocks benefited from record gold and silver futures prices, with Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan each rising about 3%.\nThe Dow gained roughly 228 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%.\nTrading volumes are expected to thin as markets head into the holiday period.\nThe New York Stock Exchange will close early on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET for Christmas Eve and remain closed on Thursday for Christmas Day.\nWith fewer catalysts on the immediate calendar, investors are likely to continue parsing economic data for clues on how long the Federal Reserve can maintain restrictive policy.\nTuesday\u2019s GDP surprise reinforced the view that the US economy is still moving forward at a solid pace, complicating the outlook for rate cuts even as inflation remains stubbornly above target."

The major index futures are currently pointing to a modestly lower open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures down by 0.2 percent.\nTraders may look to cash in on the recent strength in the markets, which saw the major averages rebound strongly after slumping early last week.\nTech stocks like Oracle (ORCL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) helped lead the recovery but are moving back to the downside in pre-market trading.\nThe futures edged lower following the release of a Commerce Department report showing the U.S. economy grew by much more than expected in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe Commerce Department said real gross domestic product spiked by 4.3 percent in the third quarter after surging by 3.8 percent in the second quarter. Economists had expected GDP to jump by 3.3 percent.\nThe much stronger than expected economic growth may lead to renewed uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates.\nMeanwhile, the Commerce Department released a separate report showing new orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods tumbled by more than expected in the month of October.\nThe report said durable goods orders plunged by 2.2 percent in October after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.7 percent in September.\nEconomists had expected durable goods orders to slump by 1.5 percent compared to the 0.5 percent increase that had been reported for the previous month.\nExcluding a nosedive by orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders crept up by 0.2 percent in October after rising by 0.7 percent in September. Ex-transportation orders were expected to rise by 0.3 percent.\nShortly before the start of trading, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its report on industrial production in the month of November. Industrial production is expected to inch up by 0.1 percent.\nExtending the strong upward move seen over the two previous sessions, stocks moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. The major averages all moved to the upside on the day following the mixed performance seen in the previous week.\nThe major averages finished the day off their highs of the session but still firmly in positive territory. The Dow rose 227.79 points or 0.5 percent to 48,362.68, the Nasdaq climbed 121.21 points or 0.5 percent to 23,428.83 and the S&P 500 advanced 43.99 points or 0.6 percent to 6,878.49.\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index closed just above the unchanged line and China's Shanghai Composite Index inched up by 0.1 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index jumped by 1.1 percent.\nMeanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the German DAX Index is just above the unchanged line, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is marginally lower and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.3 percent.\nIn commodities trading, crude oil futures are rising $0.15 to $58.16 a barrel after surging $1.49 to $58.01 a barrel on Monday. Meanwhile, after spiking $82.10 to $4,469.40 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are jumping $46.70 to $4,516.10 an ounce.\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 156.10 yen compared to the 157.05 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is trading at $1.1786 compared to yesterday's $1.1760.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com"

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It was a scary good year for investors.\nIt was scary because the U.S. stock market plunged to several historic drops on worries about everything from President Donald Trump's tariffs to interest rates to a possible bubble in artificial-intelligence technology. In the end, though, it was a great year for anyone with the stomach to stick through the swings.\nS&P 500 index funds, which sit at the heart of many savers' 401(k) accounts, returned more than 18% in 2025 through Dec. 11 and set a record high that day. It's their third straight year of big returns.\nHere's a look at some of the surprises that shaped financial markets along the way:\nTariff tremors\nTrump dropped the biggest surprise on \"Liberation Day\" in April, when he announced a sweeping set of tariffs that were more severe than investors expected.\nIt immediately triggered worries about a possible recession and spiking inflation. The S&P 500 plunged nearly 5% on April 3 for its worst day since the 2020 COVID crash. The very next day, it dropped 6% after China's response raised fears of a tit-for-tat trade war.\nThe tariffs' impact went beyond the stock market. The value of the U.S. dollar fell, and fear even shook the U.S. Treasury market, which is seen as perhaps the safest in existence.\nTrump eventually put his tariffs on pause on April 9 after seeing the U.S. bond market get \"queasy,\" as he put it, which sent relief through Wall Street. Since then, Trump has negotiated agreements with countries to lower his proposed tariff rates on their imports, helping calm investors' nerves.\nWall Street motored higher through a remarkably calm summer thanks to euphoria around artificial-intelligence technology and strong profit reports from companies. The market also got a boost from three cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\nREAD MORE: AI darlings prop up Wall Street as most other stocks fall\nTrade worries can still cause havoc in markets, and Trump sent stocks spiraling as recently as October with threats of higher tariffs on China.\nTrump and the Fed\nAnother surprise was how hard, and how personally, Trump lobbied to get the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\nThe Fed has traditionally operated separately from the rest of Washington, making its decisions on interest rates without having to bend to political whims. Such independence, the thinking goes, gives it freedom to make unpopular moves that are necessary for the economy's long-term health.\nKeeping interest rates high, for example, could slow the economy and frustrate politicians looking to please voters. But it could also be the medicine needed to get high inflation under control.\nAs inflation stubbornly remained above the Fed's 2% target, the central bank kept rates steady through August. This drew Trump's ire \u2013 even though it was his own trade policies that were driving fears about inflation higher.\nTrump continuously picked on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, even giving him the nickname \"Too Late.\" Their tense relationship reached a head in July when Trump, in front of cameras, accused Powell of mismanaging the costs of a renovation of the Fed's headquarters. Powell, in turn, shook his head.\nEven though Wall Street loves lower rates, the personal attacks caused some queasiness in financial markets because of the possibility of a less independent Fed. Powell's turn as Fed chair is set to expire in May, and the wide expectation is that Trump will choose a replacement more likely to cut rates.\nGood but not first\n\"America first\" didn't extend to global markets. Even as U.S. stocks soared to another double-digit gain, many foreign markets fared even better.\nThe technology frenzy that helped fuel gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite drove Korea's KOSPI higher in 2025, enjoying its biggest gain in more than two decades. South Korea is a technology hub and companies including Samsung and SK Hynix surged amid the focus on artificial intelligence investments and advancements.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 had"

                "body": "Netskope, Inc. stock is having another \u201cwelcome to public markets\u201d moment.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s session (December 23, 2025), Netskope (NASDAQ: NTSK) fell about 5%\u20136%, with shares last around $18.6 after trading roughly between $18.50 and $19.54. [1] That drop stood out because the broader market leaned bullish on the day\u2014U.S. indexes pushed higher as the S&P 500 hovered near record territory. [2]\nSo why is Netskope down today, what\u2019s actually changed since its high-profile September IPO, and what do forecasts and analyst price targets look like right now (as of 23.12.2025)? Here\u2019s the full picture.\nNetskope stock price today: the Dec. 23 pullback in numbers\nNetskope shares were down sharply Tuesday after closing Monday at $19.71, dipping as low as $18.50\u2013$18.51 intraday. [3]\nTwo details from today\u2019s tape matter:\n- The decline happened on relatively light trading earlier in the session, according to MarketBeat\u2019s midday read (around 411,727 shares, well below the stock\u2019s reported average volume). [4]\n- Full-day volume still ended up around 1.19 million shares, reflecting the continued elevated attention on a newly public cybersecurity name\u2014just not the kind of attention shareholders love. [5]\nThe bigger point: NTSK is still in the \u201cprice discovery\u201d phase. Newly listed stocks often swing hard as investors digest the first quarters of guidance, float dynamics, and the reality of being valued minute-by-minute instead of at a negotiated private-market price.\nThe backdrop: a choppy December after Netskope\u2019s first post-IPO earnings\nIf today\u2019s move feels familiar, it\u2019s because December has already been a volatility stress test for Netskope. Using recent closes:\n- Dec. 11: $23.50\n- Dec. 12: $20.72 (down ~11.8%)\n- Dec. 15: $19.05 (down ~8.1%)\n- Dec. 16: $20.04 (up ~5.2%)\n- Dec. 23: $18.58 (down ~5.7%) [6]\nThat pattern lines up with investor digestion of Netskope\u2019s first earnings report as a public company\u2014and, importantly, a debate about valuation.\nOne widely circulated critique after earnings was basically: the business is growing fast, but the stock was priced like it needed to be perfect immediately. Motley Fool, for example, argued the market reaction wasn\u2019t about a disaster quarter so much as guidance/expectations meeting a \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d valuation. [7]\nWhat Netskope actually reported: key metrics from the Q3 FY2026 release\nThe most concrete \u201cfundamentals update\u201d investors have is Netskope\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2026 report (quarter ended October 31, 2025). [8]\nThe growth story is real: ARR and revenue accelerated\nFrom the company\u2019s SEC-filed earnings release:\n- ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): $754 million, up 34% year over year [9]\n- Revenue: $184.2 million, up 33% year over year [10]\n- Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): surpassed $1 billion, up 41% year over year (a forward-looking \u201cbacklog-ish\u201d subscription indicator) [11]\nThose numbers are also broadly consistent with how financial press framed the print: beat on revenue and narrower loss than expected. [12]\nCash flow turned positive (a big deal for a growth IPO)\nNetskope also posted:\n- Net cash from operating activities: $11.2 million (about 6% of revenue) [13]\n- Free cash flow: $10.6 million (about 6% margin) [14]\n- Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities: $1.2 billion at quarter end [15]\nFor a company the market largely treats as a \u201chigh-growth platform bet,\u201d cash flow flipping positive\u2014even briefly\u2014is the kind of milestone that can shift the investor base from pure momentum traders toward longer-duration holders.\nThe accounting wrinkle: GAAP losses were inflated by IPO-related stock comp\nIf you only look at GAAP profitability, the quarter looks ugly:\nBut the company explains a major driver: large stock-based compensation tied to IPO-related vesting. [18]\nThis is common in IPO transitions: the business didn\u2019t suddenly become wildly worse, but the reporting optics can get weird (and spook fast-twitch investors).\nGuidance: what management told Wall Street to ex"

Fuentes' recent comments, including using a racial slur to refer to Usha Vance, have drawn backlash from Republicans such as Vivek Ramaswamy.\nVance also called out former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who now is a host on MS NOW. Psaki recently speculated on Vance's marriage during an appearance on the \"I've Had It\" podcast, and while talking about Vance\u2019s presidential ambitions, suggested that Usha Vance may need to be saved.\n\"The think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance wants to be president more than anything else.

And that he's willing to do anything to get there,\" Psaki said on the show.\nVance told UnHerd: \"On Fuentes, I\u2019ve criticized him in the past, but let me be clear: anyone who attacks my wife, whether their name is Jen Psaki or Nick Fuentes, can eat s---. That\u2019s my official policy as vice president of the United States. And my attitude towards anybody, again, who is calling for judging people based on their ethnic heritage, whether they\u2019re Jewish or white or anything else, it's disgusting. We shouldn't be doing it.\"\nVance being asked to disavow Fuentes also comes days after Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, called on conservative leaders to disavow Fuentes during his AmericaFest speech.\nUsha Vance is the first Indian American second lady in U.S. history.

My wife -- as I said at the TPUSA -- is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to reengage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage -- or any interfaith relationship -- I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife.\"\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report."

This carries some risks, as Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal explains on \u201cThe Ezra Klein Show.\u201d\nWell, that actually is a better segue to this next chart I was going to show you than I thought it would be, which is there\u2019s some suspicions going around that this whole thing has become a kind of circular money machine, that the hunt for growth, the hunt for justifying share prices and investment and valuations is leading to just money constantly passing hands to create the almost appearance of activity. So, Joe, I\u2019m going to show you this chart, which is a Bloomberg chart. It\u2019s a Bloomberg chart. I recognize it from a distance. I know this chart from a distance. And it is extremely hard to parse, including for me, but \u2014\u2014 You almost don\u2019t need to parse \u2014 like, the point is almost not to parse it. -The point is to just get a \u2014\u2014 -This chart is a vibe as much as it\u2019s anything. It\u2019s a vibe. -It\u2019s a visual more than it\u2019s just a \u2014\u2014 -Gaze upon this incredible level of interlinkages. This, to me, is the most almost interesting chart to look at in A.I. -For those just listening, here we have \u2014 it\u2019s a chart with Nvidia at the center. And basically everyone is invested in everyone else. So Nvidia invests in OpenAI, then has an investment in CoreWeave, which is one of these new cloud data center companies, and CoreWeave buys chips from Nvidia so the revenue gets recycled. So there\u2019s two \u2014 So it\u2019s basically everyone is linked to everyone else. -And, again \u2014\u2014 -Bidirectionally, yes \u2014\u2014 -And bidirectionally, it\u2019s not like you pay someone and they pay someone else. It\u2019s like you pay them. And they pay you. Yes, you invest in them and they invest in you. So I\u2019m going to invest in you. And then not only are you going to buy chips from me, you\u2019re going to make an equity investment. So, obviously, there is the web of complexity, which I think we associate with 2007, 2008, which is just like the sheer incredible number of just, the sheer volume of the web of relationships and so forth. And part of just like how hard that is to decipher. But then there\u2019s the other element that \u2014 go back to the dot-com bubble. And if you looked at a lot of the companies that were riding high on the dot-com bubble, they had real revenue. The poster child for this was Yahoo.com or Cisco. So you have these companies that say, OK, maybe they\u2019re a little rich on the stock market. But look, we know they\u2019re real businesses. The issue is that underneath these real businesses, there was a lot of financialization going on. By that, I mean specifically, there was a host of startups and they were raising money on I.P.O.s. And then that I.P.O. money that they raised would immediately be put into either ads on Yahoo or purchases of Cisco equipment. And when the I.P.O. market closed down, when there was a little bit of risk off appetite in the stock market, and suddenly then therefore the revenue collapsed at those giants. And so, yes. Well, what looked like sustainable, healthy businesses were actually really being funded by financial markets. And I think that the concern when you look at the A.I. boom is you have all these companies doing very well. Nvidia is absolutely a real business. It absolutely has real revenue. It absolutely has real profits. No one is denying it. Is there some richness in the valuation? Sure, maybe. I don\u2019t know, but very plausibly. There are real businesses. And so I think that the issue \u2014 when we talk about a bubble in the A.I., sure, there may be rich valuations, but the fear would be that the actual revenue that these are not sustainable revenues and therefore not sustainable profits.\nA.I.\u2019s \u2018Circular Money Machine\u2019\nNvidia, OpenAI and other major artificial intelligence companies all invest in one another.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radars.\nPayments platform operator PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) crossed Jim Cramer\u2019s attention after a fresh piece from investment bank Morgan Stanley. The note was quite impactful as it saw the bank not only downgrade the shares to Underweight from Equalweight but also cut the share price target to $51 from $74. As part of its rationale, Morgan Stanley commented that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u2019s checkout integrations appeared to be sluggish and could end up affecting the firm\u2019s margins. The bank wasn\u2019t the only one that lowered its price target recently. For instance, on December 5th, Deutsche Bank cut PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u2019s share price target to $65 from $75 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. The target cut had followed UBS reiterating its Hold rating and a $80 price target on December 4th, after also noting the dip in checkout integration. As for Cramer, he called the Morgan Stanley coverage \u201cdevastating\u201d and discussed PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u2019s share price:\nDenys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\u201cBut everybody seems to dislike PayPal. Morgan Stanley comes out with a piece today that\u2019s so devastating. Downgrade to Underweight, this is PayPal. . .they\u2019re talking about agentics not helping, earnings risk, slowing Venmo. Branded share loss. Holy cow, that stock\u2019s going lower, maybe much lower.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Optimism spread down the supply chain too, with Screen Holdings jumping after a broker boosted its price target. But the rest of the market looked tired: financials cooled after the Bank of Japan\u2019s recent rate hike, and a firmer yen weighed on exporters like Toyota and Subaru. Even SoftBank slipped, underlining that this wasn\u2019t a broad \u201cJa..\npan tech\u201d surge.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Headlines can hide weak breadth.\nWhen the Nikkei is up and the Topix is down, it often means gains are concentrated in a handful of mega-caps. That can make index momentum feel stronger than it is, and it raises the risk that any wobble in semiconductors drags the benchmark lower. With global trading quieter around holidays, currency and rate moves may matter more than usual for Japan\u2019s sector leadership.\nZooming out: Rates and the yen are back in play.\nJapan\u2019s higher policy rate changes the math for rate-sensitive industries, helping some lenders\u2019 margins but pressuring insurers\u2019 bond portfolios. Meanwhile, a stronger yen can clip overseas earnings when they\u2019re translated back into yen, which is why exporters can lag even on \u201cgood market\u201d days. Together, it\u2019s a reminder that domestic policy shifts can cut across the global chip-cycle story.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Tokyo stocks are heading into the Dec. 24, 2025 opening bell with a familiar end\u2011of\u2011year mix: supportive global risk sentiment after another strong U.S. session, but thin holiday liquidity and currency swings that could quickly cap upside\u2014especially for Japan\u2019s exporter\u2011heavy leaders.\nEarly indicators point to a range\u2011bound start rather than a decisive breakout. A domestic preview projected the Nikkei 225\u2019s expected range around 50,200\u201350,700, citing the tailwind from U.S. gains but also the pullback in overseas participation as global investors step away for Christmas. [1]Another widely followed pre\u2011market note likewise flagged a positive bias at the open on U.S. tech strength, while still framing the day as a holiday\u2011thinned, technical trading session. [2]\nWhere the Nikkei and TOPIX stand before the bell\nFutures positioning suggests the market is leaning modestly positive, but not aggressively.\n- OSE Nikkei 225 futures (Mar 2026) opened at 50,560 at 8:45 a.m. JST, up 70 yen from the prior settlement, implying a premium versus the previous cash close of 50,412.87. [3]\n- TOPIX futures (Mar 2026) opened at 3,426.5, down 5 points on the session, but still slightly above the prior cash close of 3,423.25. [4]\n- The Chicago Nikkei futures settlement was cited at 50,575 yen, another small signal that the market tone into Tokyo is constructive rather than defensive. [5]\nThe key takeaway: the tape is pointing up\u2014but only slightly, and that matters on a day when liquidity tends to be thinner and price moves can be exaggerated by relatively small flows. [6]\nGlobal mood boost: Wall Street hit fresh records on strong U.S. growth\nThe most immediate overnight support comes from the U.S., where stocks rose again and the S&P 500 logged another record close as investors digested a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected U.S. GDP reading. Reuters reported the Commerce Department\u2019s estimate showing GDP growth at a 4.3% annualized pace in Q3, above the consensus estimate cited in the report, reinforcing a \u201csoft\u2011landing\u201d style narrative that typically helps global equities. [7]\nFor Tokyo, this backdrop tends to favor:\n- Semiconductors and tech supply\u2011chain names, which often track U.S. megacap and chip sentiment closely.\n- Growth and momentum pockets, especially when U.S. indices are printing new highs.\nBut there\u2019s a caveat for Japan today: FX matters as much as equities.\nThe biggest swing factor: yen volatility and renewed intervention warnings\nJapan\u2019s currency has been a major driver of equity leadership this month\u2014and official rhetoric has returned to center stage.\nReuters reported Japan\u2019s finance minister issued the strongest warning yet on potential currency intervention, arguing recent yen moves do not reflect fundamentals and emphasizing Tokyo\u2019s readiness to respond to \u201cexcessive\u201d moves. Following those comments, the yen strengthened to around the 156 per dollar area in the coverage. [8]\nWhy this matters for the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the open:\n- A weaker yen typically supports exporters (autos, machinery, electronics) by inflating overseas earnings when converted back to yen.\n- A sudden yen rebound\u2014especially one driven by intervention risk\u2014can quickly pressure exporter-heavy indices, even if global equities are upbeat.\nPre\u2011market commentary in Japan has already flagged this tension: U.S. tech strength is supportive, but FX swings can become a headwind for high\u2011beta and exporter sectors. [9]\nBOJ expectations: minutes due, but markets are focused on what comes next\nToday\u2019s domestic calendar includes Bank of Japan minutes from the October meeting, though market watchers widely expect them to be backward\u2011looking compared with the BOJ\u2019s more consequential December policy move. [10]\nWhat investors are really debating is the pace of tightening in 2026\u2014and whether the BOJ could move sooner than market pricing implies. Reuters analysis this week highlighted signs of a \u201chawkish wink,\u201d including commentary pointing to the possibility that the next rate hike could a"
