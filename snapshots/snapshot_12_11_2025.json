Last month\u2019s report projected a deficit of 50,000 bpd and the September report a shortfall of 700,000 bpd.\nOil extended an earlier decline after the report was published and was down over 3% to about $63 a barrel.\nLOWER DEMAND FOR OPEC+ CRUDE\nOPEC lowered its 2026 demand forecast for OPEC+ crude by 100,000 bpd from the previous projection after an upward revision to its 2025 estimates for production outside OPEC+.\nOPEC\u2019s demand forecasts are at the higher end of industry estimates, such as those from the International Energy Agency. OPEC\u2019s outlook for a supply deficit in 2026 stood in contrast to that of the IEA and many analysts.\nThere is still a large gap between OPEC\u2019s projections and those of other forecasters, which expect supply to outpace demand significantly next year.\nIEA EXPECTS A GLUT\nThe IEA\u2019s latest forecasts imply that supply could exceed demand by about 4 million bpd in 2026, equal to almost 4% of global demand. The agency, which advises industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts on Thursday.\nOPEC also said the global economy\u2019s growth trend remained firm and it maintained its forecasts for global oil demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd this year and at a slightly faster rate in 2026.\n\"The global economy has remained resilient through 2025, supported by easing trade uncertainty since the summer,\" OPEC said in the report.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

EUR/USD immediately capitalized, breaking above previous swing highs and tapping levels not seen in weeks.\nWhy the Euro is strengthening after the Fed cut\nEven though the ECB is not aggressively hawkish, the euro benefits from:\n- A softer USD environment driven by slower expected U.S. growth\n- Improving Eurozone sentiment indicators in PMI and confidence surveys\n- Reduced recession probability in Europe heading into Q1 2026\nThe result: EUR/USD has shifted into a clearer bullish trend structure, supported by both fundamentals and technicals.\nNews drivers affecting EUR/USD (post-cut)\n1.

Price is currently sitting above the multi-week high around 1.1728, but short-term exhaustion is visible.\nThe rally has extended aggressively, suggesting that a corrective move into the 4H FVG is possible before continuation. The broader daily structure remains bullish, with clean displacement and a shift toward higher highs.\nBullish scenario: FVG tap \u2192 Continuation toward 1.1800\u20131.1850\nA bullish continuation remains the higher-probability path if:\n- Price retraces into the 4H bullish FVG (1.1650\u20131.1675 zone)\n- Buyers defend the imbalance\n- We see a higher-low structure form on the H1/H4\nUpside targets:\n- 1.1728 (multi-week high retest)\n- 1.1800 psychological level\n- 1.1850 extension target\nA dovish Fed + structural breakout supports this idea.\nBearish scenario: Failure at 1.1728 \u2192 Deeper pullback\nA corrective decline may unfold if:\n- EUR/USD rejects strongly from the multi-week high\n- The 4H FVG fails to hold on the first retest\n- Risk sentiment strengthens in favor of USD (e.g., strong NFP, hawkish Fed speakers later this month)\nDownside levels:\n- 1.1650 FVG low\n- 1.1600 liquidity pocket\n- 1.1550 deeper structural retracement\nThis would not break the overall bullish narrative but would reset the trend.\nFinal thoughts\nThe December Fed rate cut has already reshaped USD expectations.

However, the policy path for 2026 remains highly uncertain, putting focus on the Fed statement, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's press conference, and the dot plot.\nThe market is pricing in two rate cuts in 2026, whilst the September Fed dot plot indicated 1 rate cut was coming. If the Fed leaves the dot plot unchanged, that could give the US dollar a boost into the end of the year.\nHowever, it's also worth keeping in mind that the data the Fed is using is dated, with the latest US inflation figures and non-farm payrolls still not released owing to the government shutdown.\nAt the same time, investors are scaling back expectations for any further ECB rate cuts after governing council member Simkus said the central bank does not need to cut rates further, with inflation more or less on target. His comments echoed those from Isabel Schnabel earlier this week.\nIn France, political risk is slightly higher after the National Assembly narrowly approved next year's Social Security bill by a margin of 13 votes, offering a temporary base to a lack of a new minority government.\nEUR/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nEUR/USD trades within a familiar trading zone, capped by the 1.1650 resistance zone and limited by the 1.15 support zone. The price recovered from the 1.15 support zone, recovering above the 50 SMA to the 1.1650-1.17 level.\nBuyers, supported by the RSI above 50 will look to extend gains above 1.17 towards 1.1780, the October high.\nImmediate support is at 1.16, the 50 SMA. A break below here opens the door to the 1.15 support zone and the 200 SMA. A break below here creates a lower low.\nCrude oil tracks peace talks and the Fed rate decision\nOil prices are holding steady after a two-day decline as investors continued to track diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine and also look ahead to the FOMC rate decision later today.\nInvestors are closely monitoring diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which could reduce the geopolitical risk premium on oil and lead to Russian oil returning to the broader market. However, progress appears slow, as President Zelensky reaffirms his refusal to cede land to Russia and Putin shows few signs of softening.\nThe market is also monitoring the Federal Reserve's rate decision later today, with a 25-basis-point rate cut expected. The focus will be on what comes next. Should the Fed indicate more rate cuts are coming, this could improve the demand outlook for oil.\nLooking ahead, key reports from the IEA and OPEC later this week could bring clearer signals regarding supply and demand.\nOil forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nOil continues to trade in a descending channel dating back to early July. The price is being guided lower by the 50 SMA and recently faced rejection at 60.00, rebounding lower to 58.30 at the time of writing.\nSellers will look to extend the move lower towards 57.10, the November low. A break below here opens the door to 56.00, the October low ahead of 55.30, the May low.\nBuyers would need to settle above 60.00 to extend gains towards 62.60, the October high.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast: Path Toward $1.16 Set by ECB Hawkishness as Euro Steadies at $1.1622\nEUR/USD holds above $1.16 ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy cut to 3.50\u20133.75%. The euro gains on narrowing yield spreads and hawkish ECB comments, while traders eye a potential breakout toward $1.17\u2013$1.1780 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Holds 1.1622 Ahead of Fed Cut, Dollar Weakness, and ECB Tightrope\nMacro Positioning Of EUR/USD Ahead Of The Federal Reserve Decision\nEUR/USD is trading around 1.1622, maintaining a tight consolidation range as markets brace for the Federal Reserve\u2019s final 2025 rate decision. The pair is holding slightly above its 1.1605 support, reflecting investors\u2019 uncertainty about whether the Fed\u2019s 25-basis-point cut will be the last in this cycle. Futures markets now price an 89% probability of a cut to 3.50%\u20133.75%, while liquidity models suggest that the Fed could expand its balance sheet by $45 billion per month in 2026. Traders are sharply focused on Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference and the updated dot plot, which will reveal whether policymakers lean toward one or two more cuts next year.\nDespite this high-stakes backdrop, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) remains weak at 99.25, down over 7% YTD, with traders unwinding long-dollar positions built since 2022. The EUR/USD cross is benefiting from broad dollar fatigue and the absence of fresh U.S. macro data \u2014 inflation figures and the November nonfarm payrolls remain delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown. This data gap leaves the Fed navigating policy on incomplete information, creating a rare window for the euro to strengthen despite Europe\u2019s stagnant growth profile.\nECB\u2019s Cautious Policy Anchors The Euro\u2019s Stability\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains firmly on hold after a string of hawkish comments from key officials. ECB Governing Council member Gediminas Simkus stated that \u201cno further cuts are required,\u201d citing inflation being \u201cnear target\u201d at 2.1%, while Isabel Schnabel reinforced that monetary policy must remain restrictive \u201cfor longer\u201d to prevent wage-driven inflation from reigniting. These statements have limited euro downside and discouraged expectations of any ECB easing in early 2026.\nAs a result, the yield differential between the U.S. 10-year Treasury (4.17%) and German Bund (2.32%) narrowed to 185 basis points, the lowest since May. That spread compression has underpinned the euro, keeping EUR/USD comfortably above the 1.1600 floor. European political risk remains marginally elevated \u2014 the French National Assembly\u2019s narrow 13-vote passage of the Social Security bill underscored policy fragility but failed to trigger broad market flight from the euro.\nU.S. Labor Resilience And Market Sensitivity To Wage Data\nThe JOLTS Job Openings report surprised to the upside, posting 7.67 million openings versus 7.14 million expected, almost matching last month\u2019s 7.66 million. This reading suggests continued tightness in the labor market, complicating the Fed\u2019s narrative of disinflation. However, the ADP employment change remained weak at +4.8K, while the Employment Cost Index held steady at 0.8%, reflecting slower wage momentum.\nInvestors expect Powell to balance these signals carefully \u2014 too dovish a tone could trigger a new euro rally beyond 1.17, while an unexpectedly hawkish tilt could push the pair back toward 1.1550. The NFIB Small Business Index improved to 99.0 (from 98.2), suggesting that despite softer inflation, U.S. businesses remain cautious about hiring and credit conditions.\nTechnical Landscape Of EUR/USD (EUR-USD)\nEUR/USD continues to trade within a defined ascending channel, with immediate support at 1.1605 and key resistance at 1.1663. The RSI sits at 48, reflecting muted momentum but still favoring consolidation rather than breakdown. The 20-day EMA remains at 1.1620, with the pair oscillating around it since the start of the week.\nTechnically, a daily close above 1.1664 would trigger a bullish breakout, opening the path toward 1.1720, fo"

The setup leaves the pair vulnerable to a near-term inflection, with the broader June downtrend remaining intact while below resistance. A breakout here would be needed to clear the path for a larger advance, while failure risks shifting the focus back toward the 52-week moving average.

Join live on Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nBritish Pound Price Chart \u2013 GBP/USD Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; GBP/USD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In last month\u2019s British Pound Weekly Forecast we noted that GBP/USD was, \u201ctesting support this week and although the broader outlook remains tilted to the downside the immediate focus is on possible inflection off this zone with short-bias vulnerable while above.\u201d The level in focus was 1.3080/92- a region defined by the 100%extesniuon of the June decline and the 2023 high-week close (HWC). Sterling attempted to break this key zone for more than four-weeks before rebounding into the close of the month with the rally extending nearly 2.9% off the November low.\nThe bulls exhausted into confluent resistance last week at the 2024 HWC at 1.3377- note that the 75% parallel of the descending pitchfork converges on this threshold this week and a breach / weekly close above would be needed to fuel the next leg of this advance towards key resistance at the 61.8% retracement / September HWC at 1.3453/69. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached- strength surpassing this level would suggest a more significant trend reversal is underway with the next major technical consideration eyed at the 2025 HWC at 1.3648.\nInitial weekly support now rests with the July low-week close (LWC) at 1.3280 and is backed by a key confluent zone at 1.3149/54. This region is defined by the 61.8% retracement of the November advance, the 52-week moving average, and the median-line. Ultimately a close below the 1.3080 would be needed to mark resumption of the broader June downtrend with subsequent support objectives seen at the March high-week close and the 2024 March high at 1.2894/95.\nBottom line: Sterling is testing resistance this week- risk for inflection off this mark as we head into the Fed rate decision later today. From a trading standpoint, the immediate focus is on a breakout of the 1.3280-1.3372 range for guidance- ultimately, rallies would need to be limited to 1.3469 for the June downtrend to remain viable with a break below the 52-week moving average needed to fuel the next leg of the decline.\nKeep in mind the economic docket is loaded next week with November Non-Farm Payrolls and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on tap out of the US. UK CPI is slated for Wednesday with the Bank of England on Thursday- the committee remains divided on the path for interest rates after the 5-4 vote to hold last month, and the release has the potential to fuel substantial Sterling volatility "

At the time of writing, the pair trades at 1.3350, up 0.46%\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 9-3 vote split sparks GBP/USD rally, with traders watching key levels\nThe FOMC vote split was 9\u20133: Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50-bps cut, whereas Jeffrey Schmid and Austan Goolsbee preferred to keep rates unchanged.\nThe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including the updated dot plot, showed that most officials project the fed funds rate to stand near 3.4% next year, implying just one 25-bp reduction in 2026, according to the median.\nThe dot plot showed that 12 of the 19 members of the Federal Reserve expect the Fed funds rate to be below 3.50% next year. Eight of those twelve sit around the 3%-3.50% range, two expect rates around 2.75%-3%, one at 2.50%-2.75%, and Miran at around 2%-2.25%.\nGBP/USD reaction \u2013 Hourly chart\nGBP/USD pushed to the upside, bouncing off 1.3326 and hit 1.3360, before retreating somewhat ahead of Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference. A breach of the daily high will expose the December 4 high of 1.3385 ahead of 1.3400. On the downside, if the pair slides below 1.3320, expect a test of the day's low of 1.3295, with eyes set on 1.3250.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nChristian Borjon Valencia\nFXStreet\nChristian Borjon began his career as a retail trader in 2010, mainly focused on technical analysis and strategies around it.

The drop in full-time employment becomes more relevant if December registers the first consecutive declines since the pandemic.\nIf inflation continues drifting higher \u2014 which the RBA appears to anticipate \u2014 February remains a live meeting. The only scenario that materially reduces that risk is a softer January labour report paired with cooler Q4 CPI on 26 January.\nEven if the RBA hikes in February, today\u2019s numbers don\u2019t persuade me they would follow up with another increase.\nCharts prepared by Matt Simpson, Source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nAUD/USD Nears Key Resistance as Weekly Momentum Stretches\nThe Australian dollar is on track for a third straight bullish week.

December seasonality typically leans AUD/USD-positive \u2014 or USD-negative \u2014 especially in the second half of the month, so a push toward the September high remains on the table.\nBut with momentum already fading and the year\u2019s strongest data now behind us, bulls may want to stay nimble if AUD/USD makes a run at 0.67.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nAUD/USD Nears Key Resistance as Weekly Momentum Stretches\nThe daily chart shows prices flat on the day, with traders taking the softer jobs data in stride. Even so, the rally has stalled around a weekly VPOC at 0.6670 and the monthly R2 pivot near 0.6680.\nIf we see a pullback I suspect it will be minor, and dip buyers would see retracement down to the October high as a gift. But once the current pause for breath is done and dusted, a move to 67c seems quite likely, with a break of the September high bringing the October 2024 VPOC into focus.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge"

                "body": "AUD/USD remains depressed after mixed Aussie jobs data; holds above mid-0.6600s\n- AUD/USD drifts lower on Thursday and sticks to a negative bias after mixed Aussie jobs data.\n- An unexpected fall in the Australian Employment Change offsets a steady Unemployment Rate.\n- The divergent RBA-Fed policy outlooks warrant some caution for aggressive bearish traders.\nThe AUD/USD pair drifts lower during the Asian session on Thursday and erodes a part of the previous day's strong gains to its highest level since September 17. Spot prices stick to modest losses following the release of mixed Australian employment details and currently trade just above mid-0.6600s, though the downside potential seems limited.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Unemployment Rate held steady at 4.3% in November compared to the consensus estimate for an uptick to 4.4%. This, however, was offset by a fall in the number of employed people, by 21.3K during the reported month, down from 41.1K in October (revised from 42.2K) and missing the forecast of 20K. This, in turn, undermines the Australian Dollar (AUD) and turns out to be a key factor exerting some pressure on the AUD/USD pair.\nThat said, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance might hold back the AUD bears from placing aggressive bets and help limit losses for the currency pair. In fact, RBA Governor Michele Bullock, following the widely expected on-hold rate decision earlier this week, said that the Board discussed what they might have to do if rates need to go up and that it looks like more rate cuts are not needed. This could support the AUD/USD pair amid a bearish US Dollar (USD).\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near its lowest level since October 21 in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish cut on Wednesday. In a widely expected move, the US central bank lowered borrowing costs by 25 basis points and projected just one more cut in 2026. Traders, however, remained hopeful about further cuts ahead in the wake of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the post-meeting press conference.\nPowell said that the US labor market has significant downside risks and the Fed does not want its policy to push down on job creation. Investors were quick to react and are now pricing in two more rate cuts in 2026. This, along with the upbeat market mood, continues to undermine the safe-haven Greenback and should contribute to limiting losses for the perceived riskier Aussie. Hence, any further corrective slide might still be seen as a buying opportunity and remain limited.\nEconomic Indicator\nEmployment Change s.a.\nThe Employment Change released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a measure of the change in the number of employed people in Australia. The statistic is adjusted to remove the influence of seasonal trends. Generally speaking, a rise in Employment Change has positive implications for consumer spending, stimulates economic growth, and is bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). A low reading, on the other hand, is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Last release: Thu Dec 11, 2025 00:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nActual: -21.3K\nConsensus: 20K\nPrevious: 42.2K\nSource: Australian Bureau of Statistics\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

                "body": "Australian Dollar Price Forecast: Looking at the RBA rather than at the Fed\n- AUD/USD\u2019s upside impulse seems to have run out of steam near 0.6650.\n- The US Dollar faces renewed downside pressure ahead of the Fed\u2019s decision.\n- The Australian labour market report will take centre stage on Thursday.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) struggles to extend further its ongoing rally, with AUD/USD coming under some tepid pressure around the 0.6650 region, or multi-week tops.\nMeanwhile, spot maintains its bullish stance well in place for the third week in a row while flirting at the same time with its key 200-week SMA around 0.6640. The pair\u2019s inconclusive price action comes despite a decent decline in the Greenback as investors gear up for the imminent interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed)\nA steady economy quietly doing what it needs to do\nAustralia isn\u2019t firing off huge upside surprises right now, and honestly, that\u2019s kind of the goal. The recovery is moving forward at a comfortable pace, and most of the data looks pretty decent.\nThe latest PMIs helped calm a few nerves, with Manufacturing back in expansion at 51.6 and Services up to 52.7.\nShoppers are still out there too: Retail Sales rose 4.3% YoY in September, and the trade surplus nudged higher to A$3.938 billion. Business investment did slip in Q3 (-0.9% QoQ), but it feels like more of a wobble than anything worrying.\nGrowth did undershoot forecasts a bit: Real GDP rose 0.4% QoQ in Q3 vs. 0.7% previously, though the annual pace held at 2.1%. That\u2019s more or less where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expected things to be by year-end, so resilience isn\u2019t gone.\nThe labour market is still adding a tailwind. October saw 42.2K jobs created, and the unemployment rate eased to 4.3%. The domestic jobs report on Thursday will be watched closely for extra clues on where policy goes from here.\nWhere the tension remains is inflation, as October CPI accelerated to 3.8% YoY, a roughly 17-month high, driven by housing, food and recreation. The trimmed mean CPI, the RBA\u2019s favourite, also surprised higher at 3.3% YoY. And with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) now publishing monthly CPI prints, each release has become a mini-event.\nChina is still helping, just less dramatically\nChina continues to act as a safety net for Australia, even if it\u2019s no longer the main engine of excitement.\nIndeed, the Q3 GDP grew 4.0% YoY, and Retail Sales rose 2.9% YoY in October. Good numbers, just not the big punch bowl of past years.\nBut momentum is cooling: November PMIs painted a softer picture as the official NBS Manufacturing PMI edged up to 49.2 (still below 50), while the more export-sensitive RatingDog Manufacturing PMI dipped into contraction at 49.9.\nServices aren\u2019t exactly booming either: Non-manufacturing activity slid to 49.5, and RatingDog\u2019s Services PMI eased to 52.1.\nFurther data saw the trade surplus narrow slightly in September to $90.07B from $90.53B.\nThere are some positives, however: Headline CPI turned positive again at 0.7% YoY in November, the highest in almost two years. On a monthly basis, consumer prices dipped 0.1%, while Producer Prices fell 2.2% YoY.\nBut the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) is taking its time. Loan Prime Rates (LPR) remain unchanged at 3.00% (one-year) and 3.50% (five-year). So China is still helping the Aussie, just not rolling out fireworks.\nRBA staying firm on the tiller\nThe RBA delivered what markets like to call a \u201chawkish hold\u201d on Tuesday.\nThat said, the Official Cash Rate (OCR) stayed at 3.60% for a third meeting in a row, but the tone was clear: officials still see capacity constraints and weak productivity as risks, even while the labour market remains fairly tight for now.\nIn her post-meeting press conference, Governor Michele Bullock pushed back on the idea of cuts anytime soon. She said the Board was essentially weighing a longer pause or the possibility of a rate hike in 2026, with risks for growth and inflation both tilted higher. She also "

                "body": "At the time of writing in late afternoon trading in London, the US dollar was broadly lower in anticipation of a third rate cut from the Fed. There was no major data release today and the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decision came and went without stirring volatility. But all the focus is now turning to the FOMC and Fed Chair Jerome Powell ahead of the upcoming rate decision, likely to be a cut but with a hawkish tilt. Among the currency pairs to watch, the USD/JPY is set to benefit the most from any hawkish surprise you\u2019d feel, given how weak the Japanese yen has been of late. Today, though, the USD/JPY was retreating as US bond yields fell across the curve. With the Bank of Japan also set to meet next week, the USD/JPY forecast will be subject to lots of volatility, especially if the government is forced to intervene, too. All told, it is hard to see how Japan will get out of the mess it has created, which should keep the pressure on the yen even if the BoJ hikes next week.\nBefore discussing the Fed further, let\u2019s have a quick look at the charts and discuss some levels.\nTechnical USD/JPY forecast: Key levels to watch\nThe USD/JPY was retreating back towards 156.00 support level, testing the session lows when this report was written. If the Fed turns out to be less dovish than expected, the pair could climb back to 157.00, and possibly retest the highs of November at 157.90 and then that of January at 158.88 should Powell or his FOMC colleagues turn out to be significantly more hawkish than markets anticipate.\nIf the Fed triggers a dollar slide instead, then the next stop for the USD/JPY chart could be at 155.00, which is the next key level of support to watch below 156.00.\nThe bears have a lot of work to do to turn the tide, which appears unlikely ahead of the BoJ meeting next week or without intervention from the Japanese government. So, the dips should remain supported on the dips for the USD/JPY pair.\nAll about the Fed now\nWhile rates markets are still pricing around a 10% chance of no move, the Fed will be keen to avoid upsetting expectations. A 25 bps cut looks almost certain, taking the target range down to 3.50\u20133.75%. But let\u2019s cut to the chase. today\u2019s rate call was never the real headline. The real intrigue lies in the dot plots, the number of dissenters, and what Chair Powell has to say at his press conference.\nIf the dots point to just one or two cuts in 2026, that\u2019s likely to fall short of expectations, with markets currently pricing in 70\u201380 bps \u2014 effectively more than three quarter-point cuts. There\u2019s also a decent risk that the number of dissenters is higher than the lone voice we saw in October. And of course, any surprise tweaks to growth or unemployment projections could easily shift the tone.\nA lot of attention will naturally gravitate towards Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference at 19:30 GMT. It was this very setting that sparked a sharp dollar rally last time. Should he hint that three straight cuts have taken policy closer to neutral, the greenback could quickly catch a bid again.\nThat said, markets are probably braced for that sort of message anyway, especially after reassessing global central bank policy through a more hawkish lens in recent weeks. The fact that investors are still pricing several cuts for 2026 suggests much of this hinges on expectations that Kevin Hassett \u2014 widely viewed as dovish \u2014 will soon be guiding Fed policy. As such, Powell\u2019s forward-looking comments may carry diminishing weight for the dollar. Any bounce in the greenback on his remarks is likely to be short-lived against other major currencies. But against the yen, not so much because of the Japanese currency\u2019s own weakness.\nJPY bulls looking forward to BOJ policy decision\nThat is not until another week and a bit. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday, December 19, which could well be the final important day of the year as the last major central bank decides on monetary policy. There has been much debate about the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy nor"

In today\u2019s Asia session, AUD extended its gains by 0.1% after a 0.3% return seen on Tuesday, 9 December, towards a three-month high at 0.6650 (see Fig. 1).\nFig. 1: 5-day rolling performance of the US dollar against major currencies as of 10 Dec 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nAt the end of the spectrum, the Japanese yen weakened for the third consecutive session against the greenback (USD/JPY rallied by 1% on a 5-day rolling basis) due to mixed messages from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Ueda\u2019s speech on Tuesday, 9 December.\nUeda highlighted that the BoJ may ramp up government bond buying if long-term JGB yields rise rapidly, which appeared to be a signal that the BoJ is willing to tweak its existing policy after the BoJ ended its yield curve control programme in March 2024 that previously suppressed the rise in the 10-year JGB yield.\nInterestingly, technical analysis suggests that the recent 5-day rally of the USD/JPY from its 154.40 minor swing low printed on 5 December 2025 has started to lose upside momentum that may lead to a potential minor bearish reversal on the USD/JPY.\nLet\u2019s unravel in greater detail.\nPreferred trend bias (1-3 days) \u2013 Bearish with 156.00 as potential downside trigger\nFig. 2: USD/JPY major & medium-term trends as of 10 Dec 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nFig. 3: USD/JPY minor trend as of 10 Dec 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nWatch the 157.15 key short-term pivotal resistance on the USD/JPY, and a break below 156.00 key near-term support (also the 20-day moving average) may trigger a minor bearish reversal to retest the next intermediate supports at 155.35 and 154.40.\nA break and an hourly close below 154.40 may kickstart another minor downtrend sequence to expose 153.70 (also the 50-day moving average) next in the first step (see Fig. 3).\nKey elements\n- Tuesday, 9 December 2025\u2019s rally on the USD/JPY ex-post BoJ Governor Ueda\u2019s speech has stalled at the pull-back resistance of a former medium-term ascending support from 29 October 2025 low, the minor swing high area of 24 November 2025, and close to the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the prior minor downtrend from 20 November 2025 high to 5 December 2025 low, all confluence at the 157.15 level.\n- The hourly RSI momentum indicator has just staged a bearish breakdown below a key ascending support after it exited from the overbought region (above 70). These observations suggest that the recent short-term upside momentum of the USD/JPY has eased.\nAlternative trend bias (1 to 3 days)\nA clearance above 157.15 invalidates the minor bearish reversal view for a further potential squeeze up for the next intermediate resistance to come in at 158.00/158.35.\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

Markets now weigh Powell\u2019s hawkish tone as yield spreads near 4.15% | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY (Dollar\u2013Yen) Rebounds Toward 157.00 as Fed Cut Meets Hawkish Signals and BOJ Tension Builds\nUSD/JPY Pulls Back From 157.90 High as Traders Brace for Fed Decision and BOJ Intervention Risk\nThe USD/JPY pair is trading near 156.57, after retreating 30 pips in Asian hours as the yen strengthened on remarks from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who confirmed Tokyo is \u201cclosely monitoring market developments.\u201d That language triggered short-covering, although the yen\u2019s gains remain limited due to persistent policy divergence. The pair\u2019s volatility reflects anticipation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-point rate cut, expected to lower the benchmark range to 3.50%\u20133.75%, while maintaining a hawkish outlook for 2026. The dollar index weakened ahead of the announcement, but against the yen, downside remains constrained by Japan\u2019s own monetary weakness and export-driven caution.\nFed Cut With Hawkish Bias Keeps USD/JPY Supported Above 156.00\nAt the London session, traders priced in a 90% probability of a rate cut, but the focus is now on the dot plot and Chair Powell\u2019s tone. If Powell signals that the current cycle has pushed policy close to neutral, the dollar could rebound sharply, especially versus the yen, where carry trades remain profitable. The last press conference in September sparked a 0.8% single-day surge in USD/JPY, a reaction investors have not forgotten. Market pricing still implies 70\u201380 basis points of cuts through 2026, meaning that if Powell resists confirming those expectations, the pair could spike back toward 157.80\u2013158.20, retesting the yearly high at 158.88. Conversely, if the Fed signals deeper easing, the pair could slip toward 155.00, the key demand zone below the 200-day average.\nJapanese Policy Outlook: BOJ\u2019s Next Move Unlikely to Reverse Yen Weakness\nThe Bank of Japan meeting on December 19 remains the next macro catalyst. Markets expect a token rate increase, but investors doubt it will fundamentally strengthen the yen. The country\u2019s public debt exceeding 260% of GDP, along with limited growth prospects, restricts BOJ\u2019s room to tighten. Any hike could even worsen fiscal pressure by lifting yields on government bonds, making intervention more probable than a sustained monetary pivot. Analysts emphasize that Japan\u2019s only real path to yen stabilization lies in improving productivity and generating growth-led inflation, not policy tweaks. For now, the structural imbalance keeps USD/JPY in a buy-the-dip regime.\nTechnical Framework: 156.18 and 157.89 Define the Near-Term Battle Zone\nPrice structure shows clear polarity between 156 and 158. After rebounding from the 154.66 manipulation zone, USD/JPY regained its short-term bullish structure. The 4-hour chart confirms a base above 156.18, while resistance at 157.89 remains pivotal. A sustained break above this level would target 158.88, the 52-week high. If rejected, the pair could retrace toward 155.50\u2013154.60, zones of prior liquidity sweeps. Indicators confirm indecision: the RSI at 57 suggests moderate momentum, while MACD flattens near equilibrium. The overall trend remains positive above 156.00, and the correction appears technical rather than fundamental.\nYield Spreads and Options Positioning Point to Complacent Markets\nYield spreads remain in favor of the dollar, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury at 4.15% versus Japan\u2019s 10-year JGB yield near 0.96%, keeping the interest rate differential wide enough to maintain dollar attractiveness. One-month implied volatility for USD/JPY has dropped below 7%, the lowest since early 2024, showing traders\u2019 complacency. The cost of yen protection (buying USD/JPY puts) is near historical lows, making volatility accumulation trades attractive. Speculative pos"

The decline marked a decisive break of the July uptrend with the sell-off approaching downtrend support in the wake of the BoC and Fed rate decisions. The immediate focus is on a reaction into the lower parallel of this descending pitchfork with daily momentum (RSI) now falling to the weakest level since June.\nCanadian Dollar Price Chart \u2013 USD/CAD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on TradingView\nNotes: A closer look at Canadian Dollar price action shows USD/CAD trading within the confines of an embedded channel extending off the late-November high. Initial support rests with the 61.8% retracement of the June advance at 1.3769 and is backed by a more significant confluence zone at 1.3722/34- a region defined by the August and September lows, and the 2025 low-week close (LWC). Look for a larger reaction there IF reached with a break / close below this threshold threatening another bout of accelerated losses. Subsequent support rests with the 78.6% retracement at 1.3669.\nInitial resistance is eyed at the highlight slope confluence near ~1.3850 and is backed by a key pivot zone at 1.3881-1.3904- a region defined by the 2022 high close, the 2023 high and the 200-day moving average. A breach / close above this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant low is in place and that a larger trend reversal is underway. Subsequent resistance objectives eyed at the November low / October low-day close (LDC) at 1.3938/42 and the 2022 high at 1.3978.\nBottom line: A three-week decline in USD/CAD is now approaching key technical support barriers at the lower bounds of the late-November downtrend. While the medium-term outlook remains weighted to the downside, the decline may be vulnerable near-term into this threshold, and the risk rises for inflection at the lower parallel. From a trading standpoint, look to zone to reduce short-exposure / lower protective stops on a drop towards trend support. Rallies should be limited to the 1.38-handle IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 1.3722 needed to fuel the next major leg of the decline.\nKeep in mind we get the release of the November Non-Farm Payrolls report and key inflation data next week.

                "body": "The USD/CAD forecast is subject to heightened volatility today as both North American central banks will decide on their respective monetary policies. Following the release of some stronger US data in recent days, the US dollar has rebounded against most major currencies, most notably the yen, although it has struggled against the ComDolls owing to an overall positive risk appetite. With the CAD looking strong, the USD/CAD is one to watch for potential downside traction once the dust of rate decisions settles.\nBank of Canada to push back against rate hike bets\nThe Bank of Canada will shortly decide on interest rates, and literally no one is expecting any changes, meaning the policy rate is set to remain at 2.25%. This meeting takes place amid a broader hawkish shift in global rate expectations, which is partly why commodity dollars have bounced back with markets pricing in around 30 basis points of rate hikes from the BOC by the start of Q4 next year. But given that the BOC has only recently ended its rate-cutting cycle, it feels premature for the central bank to signal rate hikes for 2026 at this meeting. That could expose the downside risks for the USD/CAD forecast today, and the currency pair could climb even higher should the Fed turn out to be more hawkish later on in the day than expected. However, I would then expect to see the USD/CAD resume lower as the US dollar recovery loses steam.\nFOMC cut a done deal\nThough there is a small 10% chance of a no cut, as implied by rates markets, the Fed wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint the market today and it will most definitely provide that 25 bps cut, which would bring the target range down to 3.50\u20133.75%. But the rate decision was never going to be the main focus today, anyway. Much of the attention will be on the dot plots, the number of dissenters opposing the cut, and Chair Powell\u2019s press conference.\nIf the dot plots show only one or two cuts for 2026, this will disappoint expectations given market\u2019s pricing of 70-80 basis points (that equates to more than three 25bps cuts). There is also a risk that dissenters opposing the cut will be higher compared with just one in October. Watch out for any surprise revisions to growth and unemployment, too.\nMuch of the focus will be on the outgoing Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference. Last time it was during this event that triggered a sharp rally in the dollar. If he suggests that the three consecutive cuts have pushed the policy rate closer to neutral, then watch out for a quick pop in the greenback.\nAdmittedly, though, the market must be expecting that sort of a language from the Fed anyway given that the markets have been reassessing global central bank policy through a more hawkish lens in the last couple weeks anyway. The fact that the markets are still pricing in a few rate cuts for 2026 suggests that much of this has to do with expectations that front-runner Kevin Hassett, a dove, will be steering the Fed\u2019s policy in a few months\u2019 time. Consequently, Powell\u2019s comments of future policy will have diminishing impact on the dollar. Any dollar rally on the back of his comments should therefore be short-lived.\nTechnical USD/CAD forecast and key levels to watch\nFrom a technical point of view, the USD/CAD forecast leans bearish. The currency pair topped out in February this year after a false breakout attempt above the prior highs formed around the 1.4670\u20131.4690 area in 2016 and 2020. Since that fake-out, the USD/CAD has been printing lower lows and lower highs, until bottoming at 1.3540 in June. From that low, rates managed to climb all the way to 1.4140 area by November, before the selling resumed.\nLast week saw rates break decisively below the 200-day moving average and a bullish trend line around the 1.3900\u20131.3955 area. This zone, once key support, is now the most important resistance region to watch. For as long as this area holds, the path of least resistance remains to the downside for the USD/CAD.\nThe most immediate target is the"

                "body": "At the time of writing in late afternoon trading in London, the US dollar was broadly lower in anticipation of a third rate cut from the Fed. There was no major data release today and the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decision came and went without stirring volatility. But all the focus is now turning to the FOMC and Fed Chair Jerome Powell ahead of the upcoming rate decision, likely to be a cut but with a hawkish tilt. Among the currency pairs to watch, the USD/JPY is set to benefit the most from any hawkish surprise you\u2019d feel, given how weak the Japanese yen has been of late. Today, though, the USD/JPY was retreating as US bond yields fell across the curve. With the Bank of Japan also set to meet next week, the USD/JPY forecast will be subject to lots of volatility, especially if the government is forced to intervene, too. All told, it is hard to see how Japan will get out of the mess it has created, which should keep the pressure on the yen even if the BoJ hikes next week.\nBefore discussing the Fed further, let\u2019s have a quick look at the charts and discuss some levels.\nTechnical USD/JPY forecast: Key levels to watch\nThe USD/JPY was retreating back towards 156.00 support level, testing the session lows when this report was written. If the Fed turns out to be less dovish than expected, the pair could climb back to 157.00, and possibly retest the highs of November at 157.90 and then that of January at 158.88 should Powell or his FOMC colleagues turn out to be significantly more hawkish than markets anticipate.\nIf the Fed triggers a dollar slide instead, then the next stop for the USD/JPY chart could be at 155.00, which is the next key level of support to watch below 156.00.\nThe bears have a lot of work to do to turn the tide, which appears unlikely ahead of the BoJ meeting next week or without intervention from the Japanese government. So, the dips should remain supported on the dips for the USD/JPY pair.\nAll about the Fed now\nWhile rates markets are still pricing around a 10% chance of no move, the Fed will be keen to avoid upsetting expectations. A 25 bps cut looks almost certain, taking the target range down to 3.50\u20133.75%. But let\u2019s cut to the chase. today\u2019s rate call was never the real headline. The real intrigue lies in the dot plots, the number of dissenters, and what Chair Powell has to say at his press conference.\nIf the dots point to just one or two cuts in 2026, that\u2019s likely to fall short of expectations, with markets currently pricing in 70\u201380 bps \u2014 effectively more than three quarter-point cuts. There\u2019s also a decent risk that the number of dissenters is higher than the lone voice we saw in October. And of course, any surprise tweaks to growth or unemployment projections could easily shift the tone.\nA lot of attention will naturally gravitate towards Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference at 19:30 GMT. It was this very setting that sparked a sharp dollar rally last time. Should he hint that three straight cuts have taken policy closer to neutral, the greenback could quickly catch a bid again.\nThat said, markets are probably braced for that sort of message anyway, especially after reassessing global central bank policy through a more hawkish lens in recent weeks. The fact that investors are still pricing several cuts for 2026 suggests much of this hinges on expectations that Kevin Hassett \u2014 widely viewed as dovish \u2014 will soon be guiding Fed policy. As such, Powell\u2019s forward-looking comments may carry diminishing weight for the dollar. Any bounce in the greenback on his remarks is likely to be short-lived against other major currencies. But against the yen, not so much because of the Japanese currency\u2019s own weakness.\nJPY bulls looking forward to BOJ policy decision\nThat is not until another week and a bit. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday, December 19, which could well be the final important day of the year as the last major central bank decides on monetary policy. There has been much debate about the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy nor"

U.S. Bitcoin funds recorded $152 million in net inflows on December 9, marking one of the strongest single-day turnarounds of Q4. The move reflects renewed investor confidence after several sessions of redemptions and coincides with a broader shift in leverage and risk appetite ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s final policy decision of 2025.\nData from SoSoValue and Farside Investors confirms that Fidelity\u2019s FBTC ETF led inflows with $199 million, while BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) \u2014 priced at $53.03 (+0.34%) with a market cap of $168.88 billion \u2014 absorbed $135 million in outflows, signaling rotational repositioning rather than indiscriminate buying. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC ended positive for the first time in a week with $33.8 million in net inflows, showing that institutional sentiment has shifted from defensive to opportunistic positioning.\nAcross the ETF sector, Ethereum ETFs added $178 million, and Solana funds gained $16.5 million, led by Bitwise\u2019s BSOL ETF ($7.8M), showing that the current rally extends beyond Bitcoin into broader crypto diversification. Still, Bitcoin remains the primary liquidity anchor, holding 67% of total ETF market share across U.S. exchanges.\nIBIT (NASDAQ:IBIT) Leads Market Liquidity as Spot Trading Accelerates\nIBIT ETF, trading between $51.96 and $53.66, continues to dominate daily turnover with an average volume of 69.5 million shares. Despite temporary outflows, the fund retains $168.88 billion in AUM, nearly 1.4x larger than all competing Bitcoin ETFs combined. Analysts note that IBIT\u2019s outflows largely stem from institutional rotation into cheaper or newly launched ETF classes, rather than sentiment deterioration.\nIts year-to-date performance shows a 23% gain, in line with BTC\u2019s spot performance, indicating accurate NAV tracking and minimal slippage. Since its January debut, IBIT has accumulated over 570,000 BTC, equivalent to $53.4 billion in direct Bitcoin holdings. Institutional allocators \u2014 including BlackRock\u2019s managed retirement accounts and UBS\u2019s structured ETF channels \u2014 continue to treat IBIT as the benchmark exposure vehicle.\nMeanwhile, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC now holds $39.8 billion AUM, closing the gap on IBIT amid aggressive inflow streaks. ARK 21Shares (ARKB) and Bitwise\u2019s BITB maintain smaller but consistent flows, capturing retail-driven momentum. Combined, the top five Bitcoin ETFs hold over $120 billion in BTC assets, representing nearly 12% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply \u2014 a structural shift in liquidity distribution unseen before 2024.\nRetail Capitulation Meets Institutional Accumulation\nOn-chain behavior supports the ETF rotation narrative. Glassnode data shows exchange balances falling by 34,000 BTC in the past week, while whale wallets (>10,000 BTC) accumulated +1.6% more holdings, reaching levels last seen before the March 2024 rally. Retail traders, by contrast, continue to sell into strength, creating a redistribution cycle typical of mid-bull phases.\nCoinbase Institutional reported that speculative leverage is now half of Q2 2025 peaks, with its systemic leverage ratio stabilizing near 4%\u20135% of total market cap, down from 10% during the summer surge.

With Bitcoin prices facing significant volatility and concerns over potential price manipulation during US trading hours, Tidal Trust II\u2019s new strategy aims to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s price movements after hours. This innovative approach focuses on Bitcoin futures and options to provide investors with exposure to the digital asset when US markets are closed.\nBitcoin ETF Proposal Targets After-Hours Market Activity\nTidal Trust II has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The fund aims to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s price movements during the overnight trading hours when US markets are closed. The filing comes at a time when Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETFs have faced significant pressure, leading to record outflows and concerns over market manipulation.\nThe new proposal includes two distinct funds: the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF and the Nicholas Bitcoin Tail ETF. These funds will target Bitcoin\u2019s returns during after-hours trading, utilizing Bitcoin futures, Bitcoin options, and Bitcoin ETFs or exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed in the US. Unlike traditional Bitcoin ETFs that directly hold the cryptocurrency, this proposal will focus on trading Bitcoin-linked financial instruments outside the US market\u2019s regular trading hours.\nBitcoin Futures and Synthetic Positions\nThe After Dark ETF will not hold Bitcoin directly but will gain exposure to Bitcoin through futures, options, and ETFs. According to the registration documents, the fund will primarily trade Bitcoin futures and options during the overnight period when US markets are closed. These positions will be closed at the opening of the US market each day.\nIn the case of Bitcoin options, the fund aims to establish a synthetic long Bitcoin position as US markets close, which will typically be unwound before the next market open. This trading strategy targets Bitcoin\u2019s price movements after the US market closes and is designed to take advantage of specific market trends observed during these hours.\nThe fund\u2019s strategy also involves holding short-term US Treasury securities and cash equivalents during US trading hours. These investments will be made when Bitcoin-related positions are not active, ensuring liquidity and flexibility for the fund\u2019s portfolio.\nRecord Outflows and Declining Bitcoin Prices\nBitcoin ETFs have faced considerable pressure in recent months. November 2025 saw record outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $3.48 billion in withdrawals. The largest portion of these outflows came from BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF, which accounted for $2.34 billion in withdrawals alone. The heavy outflows coincide with a sharp decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price, which fell by 17.4% in November, marking its worst monthly performance of the year.\nThis sharp decline in Bitcoin prices has raised concerns about investor confidence, contributing to cautious sentiment in the broader digital asset market. As a result, Bitcoin ETFs have faced challenges, with additional outflows extending into December. Despite this, some signs of stabilization were noted, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing $151.74 million in inflows on December 9.\nConcerns Over Market Manipulation\nIndustry analysts have raised concerns over potential price manipulation during the US market\u2019s open hours. A recurring pattern of Bitcoin price drops around the market\u2019s opening has led to speculation about price manipulation tactics.

                "body": "Superstate introduced a new pathway that brings public equity issuance onto blockchain networks through a regulated structure. The firm now enables SEC-registered companies to sell new tokenized shares directly to investors on Ethereum and Solana. The move signals a shift toward faster capital formation as firms search for more efficient fundraising channels.\nMoreover, the development arrives as U.S. regulators accelerate experiments that merge traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Consequently, the launch positions Superstate at the center of efforts to modernize how public companies raise money and maintain shareholder records.\nDirect Issuance Targets Faster Funding and Instant Settlement\nThe Direct Issuance Program lets issuers receive capital in stablecoins while investors receive tokenized shares in real time. This structure allows companies to manage shareholder updates instantly through Superstate\u2019s regulated transfer agent system. Additionally, the program supports existing share classes or new digital-only classes, giving companies more flexibility in how they engage investors.\nSuperstate expects the first offerings to launch in 2026. The firm argues that companies need issuance rails that match global capital flows and deliver immediate settlement.\nHence, the appeal of stablecoin-based transactions grows as markets demand more certainty and speed. The approach may also help smaller issuers reach investors who prefer blockchain-based assets with transparent lifecycle tracking.\nRegulators Accelerate Blockchain Experiments\nRegulators under the Trump administration encourage more crypto-financial innovation, which strengthens interest in tokenized securities. Both the SEC and CFTC now advance guidelines that reduce uncertainty around digital issuance. Moreover, large issuers and fintech firms continue to test onchain models that integrate with compliance tools and custodial systems.\nEarlier efforts by Galaxy and Sharplink involved tokenizing existing shares for onchain holding. However, those initiatives did not raise new capital. Superstate now extends that foundation by enabling primary issuance that interacts directly with blockchain liquidity.\nProgrammable Securities Unlock New Use Cases\nTokenized shares issued through the program can include programmable features that update governance or distribution rules automatically. Besides, the digital structure allows integrations with onchain settlement, portfolio management, and institutional custody providers. These features may attract investors seeking assets that combine regulatory protection with efficient blockchain execution.\nSuperstate intends to open its offering to both retail and institutional buyers after KYC checks. Consequently, the initiative may reshape how issuers approach capital formation and how investors access regulated digital securities."

Investors receive the tokenized shares immediately, and the company\u2019s shareholder records are updated in real time via Superstate\u2019s SEC-registered transfer agent infrastructure.\nFirst issuers are expected to go live next year, the firm said.\nThe move comes as tokenization is gaining traction with financial institutions and other businesses exploring blockchain rails for efficiency gains. In an interview last week, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said tokenization could \"reshape the financial system\" over the next few years, underscoring how regulators are opening the door to blockchain as part of the next generation of market infrastructure.\nSuperstate's new initiative marks a shift from traditional capital raising \u2014 where public companies typically rely on banks, underwriters and weeks of paperwork \u2014 to a model where firms can take investments directly into a crypto wallet. The process could reduce costs and remove delays, according to Superstate.\n\"It\u2019s time for a reset that better serves investors and smaller issuers, and makes clear that onchain capital raising should be possible without persistent uncertainty,\" Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said. \"If public companies are going to raise capital faster, more efficiently, and more globally, primary issuance needs rails that support instant settlement, transparent participation, and compliance by design \u2014 not bolted-on workarounds.\"\nSuperstate's direct issuance tool builds on Opening Bell, a platform rolled out earlier this year for tokenizing public equity. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) were among the first to use the system, issuing a version of their stocks.\nRead more: Regulatory Battle Over Tokenized U.S. Stocks Escalates, HSBC Says\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines.

The upgrade aims to improve network efficiency and reduce users' transaction fees, especially for L2 networks and during periods of high network activity. Key fee-reduction mechanisms included:\n- An increased block gas limit from 45 million to 60 million (EIP-7935), to allow more transactions per block and reduce congestion.\n- Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) (EIP-7594), to lower per-validator load and allow the network to support larger blob capacity without increasing hardware requirements. Blob capacity for L2 rollups was expanded, directly driving down L2 transaction fees that could approach near-zero cost as blob capacity grows.\nThe median transaction cost for some L2s has yet to reflect a significant change following the Fusaka upgrade. Further observation is required to assess the full impact on cost reduction.\nNews Highlights\n- Crypto.com and 21Shares announced a strategic partnership to launch new investment products tracking the Cronos (CRO) token, including a private trust and ETF, aiming to expand regulated access to the Cronos ecosystem.\n- Cronos Labs launched Cronos One, a unified onboarding hub that streamlines Web3 entry through bridging, wallet top-ups, and on-chain verification.

                "body": "Dow Jones Analysis: The DJIA Tries to Maintain Optimism Ahead of the FOMC Decision\nThe Dow Jones Index has attempted to sustain a gain of more than 0.4% during the latest trading session, maintaining a consistent bullish bias as the market looks optimistically toward today\u2019s U.S. central bank decision, scheduled for December 10. For now, the index remains attentive to the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments, which may reveal whether a flexible monetary policy could continue into 2026. If confirmed, this scenario could support continued buying pressure in the Dow Jones over the coming sessions.\nThe Day of the Federal Reserve Arrives\nToday marks the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-awaited rate decision, and optimism in the equity market has remained steady, largely because there is a high probability of a rate cut from 4.00% to 3.75%. This potential cut has strengthened confidence in indices such as the Dow Jones, which has returned to levels near its all-time highs. In general terms, a lower interest rate reduces borrowing costs in the U.S. economy, encouraging consumption and investment, which supports the performance of the companies that make up the Dow and boosts short-term market confidence.\nHowever, the key factor will be whether this confidence can be sustained through the end of the year. Markets had already priced in this cut, but the real question is whether the same outlook will hold throughout 2026. One of the most important elements influencing this expectation is the recent trajectory of inflation in the United States: after hitting a low of 2.3% in April, inflation has risen steadily, reaching 3.00% in September. This persistent upward trend moves inflation away from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2.00% target and could become an obstacle that prevents the central bank from committing to a prolonged period of lower rates.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIndeed, the CME probability model already reflects this uncertainty. It projects only one additional rate cut below 3.75% by June 17 of next year, with a 41.5% chance of reaching 3.5%. Beyond that date, the market anticipates a relatively stable rate environment throughout the first half of 2026. This outlook may become clearer after the Federal Reserve\u2019s commentary following today\u2019s decision.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nWith this in mind, short-term confidence in the index will largely depend on the tone the central bank adopts in the coming hours. If a scenario of further upcoming rate cuts is confirmed, it could act as a catalyst to maintain stable demand for the Dow Jones. However, if the comments suggest a more neutral stance for 2026, confidence may weaken and renewed selling pressure could return to the index in the days ahead.\nDow Jones Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Neutrality Begins to Emerge: Over recent weeks, the Dow Jones has sustained consistent buying pressure, but this has not yet been enough to break above its all-time highs. Recent price action has shown signs of neutrality in the latest candles, casting doubt on the index\u2019s ability to preserve the long-term bullish trendline that dominated the second half of 2025. If this neutral behavior persists, a sideways range may form toward year-end, especially if the price fails to regain strong directional momentum while the market awaits the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcements.\n- RSI: Although the RSI continues to fluctuate above the neutral 50 zone, recent sessions have shown a flattening slope, indicating a balance between buying and selling impulses. If the RSI does not begin to strengthen, this neutral price environment may continue in the coming sessions.\n- MACD: The MACD remains very close to the zero line, suggesting that short-term moving-average strength is neutral. This could lead to a period of price indecision, particularly if stronger directional signals do not emerge following the central bank\u2019s remarks.\nKey Levels:\n- 48,266 points \u2013 Key resistance: This level corresponds to the all-time highs and represents the most i"

                "body": "European markets tread water ahead of Fed decision\nEuropean shares edged lower as traders held back ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision, with the STOXX 600 posting its fourth straight decline.\nFTSE 100 and DAX mark time\nThe FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX 40 both slipped 0.1% as traders opted to sit on their hands ahead of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision. These aren't dramatic moves, but they signal a market unwilling to commit capital before Jerome Powell speaks.\nLondon's benchmark has been range-bound for days now, unable to break higher but not collapsing either. This sort of grinding action typically precedes a more significant move once the catalyst arrives\u2014in this case, Fed guidance.\nThe DAX mirrored the FTSE's modest decline, suggesting the cautious mood extends across Europe's major bourses. German shares have held up relatively well this year, but today's session shows even the strongest markets are vulnerable to pre-announcement jitters.\nSpain's IBEX followed the same pattern with a 0.1% decline. When all major European indices move in lockstep like this, it tells you macro concerns are trumping individual market dynamics.\nCAC 40 underperforms on French budget drama\nFrance's CAC 40 dropped 0.1% after lawmakers narrowly approved the 2026 social security budget. The government secured a victory, but the tight margin highlights ongoing political fragility that continues to weigh on French assets.\nThe budget approval might sound like good news, but the political capital spent achieving it raises questions about future policy decisions. Markets don't like uncertainty, and France has provided plenty of it this year.\nFrench equities have underperformed their European peers throughout 2024, and yesterday's budget saga did nothing to reverse that trend. For traders considering French exposure, the political backdrop remains a significant headwind.\nThe CAC's weakness relative to the FTSE and DAX matters for anyone trading European markets. When one major index consistently lags its peers, it suggests structural issues beyond simple cyclical factors.\nLondon financials lead the retreat\nFinancials and industrials\u2014two sectors that have supported UK markets in recent weeks\u2014both retreated on Wednesday. Their decline suggests the defensive positioning extends beyond isolated pockets of weakness.\nInsurers fell 0.4%, dragged lower by Aegon's 7% plunge following its trading update. When a large-cap stock drops that sharply, it inevitably weighs on the sector, regardless of how its peers are performing.\nThe sector rotation tells us something about market psychology. When reliable supports like financials and industrials stumble, it indicates genuine uncertainty rather than simple profit-taking.\nFor traders looking to buy shares in these sectors, the current weakness might present opportunities. But with the Fed decision looming, patience seems the wiser course until Powell provides clarity on 2026's policy direction.\nFed decision dominates thinking\nThe Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points later today. This is already priced in, so the decision itself matters less than Powell's commentary on what comes next.\nTraders want to know whether the Fed will continue cutting in 2026, and at what pace. Weakening economic conditions suggest more cuts may be necessary, but inflation concerns could limit the Fed's room to manoeuvre.\nPowell's guidance will set the tone for markets heading into year-end. A dovish stance would likely boost risk assets, while hawkish commentary could trigger further selling across equities and bonds.\nEuropean markets' subdued performance reflects this uncertainty. Why take on significant positions when a single press conference could dramatically shift the outlook? For those learning how to trade shares, this exemplifies why timing matters.\nWhy the Fed matters for London and Frankfurt\nIt might seem odd that the FTSE 100 and DAX are so fixated on a US central bank decision. But the Fed's influence exten"

Even if you don\u2019t personally use ChatGPT or Gemini to write emails or plan your holiday, you\u2019ll still be engaging with AI some way when you shop online, use social media or contact businesses. If you\u2019ve been unwell recently, AI might have been involved then too, with half of hospitals now using it as part of the diagnostic process.\nThis has resulted in huge growth in the companies involved, as James Scott-Hopkins, founder of wealth manager EXE Capital Management, explains: \u201cNvidia has recently become the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5trn (\u00a33.8trn). Its value now dwarfs all 350 constituents of the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices, whose combined market value is about $3.4trn (\u00a32.6trn).\n\u201cThe companies that make up the so-called Magnificent Seven [Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla \u2013 all of which are tech-based and investing significantly in AI] now account for more than a third of the US S&P 500 Index.\u201d\nJason Hollands, managing director at Best Invest, adds: \u201cFervour about the potential of AI has seen vast amounts of money flow into companies involved with AI, including those developing the advanced computer microchips and other hardware needed to power it, those involved with building and housing massive data centres and providing the required cooling systems.\n\u201cThis has stoked concerns of an investment bubble, as we saw from 1995-2000 when the internet took off and the \u2018dotcom\u2019 bubble ballooned and then spectacularly burst.\u201d\nBut while the leaders in AI are largely US-based, the UK wouldn\u2019t be immune if their share prices suffered a fall. \u201cThe Bank of England has flagged concern that if the AI mania comes to an abrupt end at some point, it will have a contagion-like effect on other markets too, including on pension funds,\u201d he adds.\nThis is the billion-dollar question.\nLaith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell says that there are definite similarities between the current environment and the \u2018dotcom boom\u2019. Once again, we\u2019re worrying about tech firms\u2019 share prices. But, he points out, this time there is a significant difference.\n\u201cEven if AI disappoints and the big technology companies which sit at the top table of the US stock market don\u2019t make the profits that are currently baked into prices, these companies do have highly profitable businesses which could act as a safety net on any price falls. Some of the biggest failures from the \u2018dotcom boom\u2019 weren\u2019t mature companies with hundreds of millions of customers, some were simply ideas wrapped in a corporate shell, which was then floated on the stock market.\u201d\nThe worry, says Hollands, is that revenues from AI might not be proportional to the investment it demands. \u201cAI is going to have a voracious appetite for ongoing capital investment \u2013 ever more powerful computer chips that needed to be upgraded and vast amounts of energy to power supercomputers and cooling systems to stop them overheating.\n\u201cActual revenues for AI platforms like OpenAI [the owner of C"

                "body": "Updated 10 December 2025 \u2014 With UK inflation easing, interest rates likely past their peak, and a wave of share buybacks supporting valuations, the London market is finally starting to look interesting again for long\u2011term investors. The FTSE 100 inched higher yesterday as defence names like BAE Systems and Rolls\u2011Royce offset weakness in British American Tobacco, while investors positioned for potential rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in 2026. [1]\nAt the same time, the Bank of England expects Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 first budget to shave roughly 0.4\u20130.5 percentage points off inflation from mid\u20112026, mainly via energy\u2011bill support, on top of the decline already seen from 2022\u2019s 11%+ peak to 3.6% in October 2025. [2] Its latest Financial Stability Report also suggests UK banks remain resilient even under severe stress scenarios. [3]\nPut together, that backdrop of disinflation + a still\u2011solid banking system + heavy buybacks (FTSE 100 companies are on course to repurchase about \u00a356.6bn of stock this year) is creating a fertile hunting ground for investors looking for the best UK stocks to buy now. [4]\nBelow you\u2019ll find eight FTSE\u2011listed names that stand out today based on recent news, forecasts and analysis as of 10 December 2025. This is not personal financial advice \u2013 think of it as a researched watchlist to investigate further.\nHow we picked these \u201cbest UK stocks to buy now\u201d\nFor this list we focused on companies that, as of early December 2025, show at least some combination of:\n- Robust recent results \u2013 revenue and profit growth, or evidence of resilience through the rate\u2011hike cycle\n- Clear catalysts \u2013 fresh contracts, pipeline milestones, restructurings or regulatory decisions announced in late 2025\n- Reasonable valuations \u2013 based on recent analyst commentary and market multiples, not just historical glamour\n- Balance\u2011sheet strength \u2013 especially important with rates still elevated\n- Decent dividend or buyback support, where applicable\nWe also tried to diversify across sectors: healthcare, defence, energy, utilities, consumer staples, banking and data/analytics, plus one more contrarian recovery play.\nAgain: none of these is guaranteed to outperform. Prices, ratings and forecasts can change quickly.\n1. AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN) \u2013 Healthcare heavyweight with pipeline momentum\nWhy it\u2019s on the list now\nAstraZeneca remains one of the UK\u2019s flagship growth companies \u2013 and 2025 has reinforced that status. In its 9M and Q3 2025 results, the group reported 11% year\u2011to\u2011date revenue growth, driven by double\u2011digit expansion across all therapy areas, including 16% growth in Oncology. [5]\nRecent news flow has been particularly supportive:\n- On 9 December 2025, AstraZeneca announced that the first patient has been dosed in the randomized phase of the DESTINY\u2011Ovarian01 Phase 3 trial, testing ENHERTU plus bevacizumab as first\u2011line maintenance in HER2\u2011expressing advanced ovarian cancer \u2013 an important potential new use for one of its key oncology assets. [6]\n- Earlier this month the US FDA accepted Baxdrostat for priority review in hard\u2011to\u2011control hypertension, another late\u2011stage pipeline asset. [7]\nShare\u2011price performance has been strong: one recent valuation piece noted a ~28% year\u2011to\u2011date gain and nearly 30% over 12 months, leaving the stock trading on a premium multiple (around 30x earnings) but with growth to match. [8]\nInvestment case in December 2025\n- Structural growth in oncology, rare disease and cardiovascular drugs provides a long runway, relatively independent of the UK macro cycle.\n- The late\u2011stage pipeline is busy, with multiple catalysts in 2026\u201327 (including ENHERTU expansion and Baxdrostat).\n- Defensive, low\u2011beta characteristics can help dampen volatility if UK or global growth disappoints. [9]\nKey risks\n- The valuation already prices in a lot of success; any clinical setback could hit the shares hard.\n- Drug\u2011pricing pressure in the US and Europe remains a long\u2011term overhang.\n- Currency moves (stro"

[1]\nBelow is a detailed look at how major EU indices, sectors and key stocks performed today, and what the latest forecasts say about the outlook for 2026.\nMarket snapshot: small moves, cautious tone\nBy late morning in Europe, the STOXX Europe 600 was down around 0.1\u20130.2% near 576\u2013577 points, putting it on track for a fourth consecutive daily decline. [2]\n- Germany\u2019s DAX: German equities underperformed, with the DAX down roughly 0.5% at one point in the morning, according to Reuters, after a flat finish the previous day. [3]\n- Spain\u2019s IBEX 35: Also weaker, slipping around 0.2% in early trade. [4]\n- France\u2019s CAC 40: The CAC 40 traded in the red for most of the session. Around midday it was down about 0.4%at 8,016.78, weighed by industrials and defence stocks. [5]\n- UK\u2019s FTSE 100: London was a relative bright spot. The blue\u2011chip FTSE 100 was up about 0.1% in late morningand roughly 0.3% around midday at 9,673.64, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 dipped slightly. [6]\nIntraday commentary showed both the STOXX 50 and STOXX 600 \u201chovering around the flatline,\u201d underlining how reluctant traders are to take big positions with central\u2011bank decisions looming. [7]\nFed decision dominates global risk mood\nThe main macro story today is not European at all \u2014 it\u2019s the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nMarkets are pricing in an almost certain 25\u2011basis\u2011point Fed rate cut, but the real focus is on the so\u2011called \u201cdot plot\u201d of policymakers\u2019 forecasts and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s guidance for 2026. [8]\n- Futures imply the Fed will lower the target range to roughly 3.50\u20133.75%, with traders assigning close to a 90% probability to a move later today. [9]\n- However, markets see only limited odds of another cut as soon as January, raising the risk of a \u201chawkish cut\u201dscenario: a rate reduction paired with messaging that further easing will be slow and data\u2011dependent. [10]\nA global Reuters wrap noted that European stocks and S&P 500 futures were each off by about 0.1%, reflecting a broad \u201cwait\u2011and\u2011see\u201d stance as investors weigh not just rates but lofty AI\u2011related earnings expectations in the U.S. tech space. [11]\nFor EU equities, that means:\n- Muted volumes and tight trading ranges today.\n- Potential volatility tomorrow, once markets have had a chance to digest the Fed\u2019s new projections.\nECB: rates \u201cin a good place\u201d and likely on hold to end\u20112026\nIf the Fed is today\u2019s headline, the ECB is the slow\u2011burn story shaping the medium\u2011term outlook for EU stocks.\nAt a Financial Times event, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the eurozone economy has proved more resilient than expected to trade tensions and higher U.S. tariffs, and that growth is now running close to potential. That resilience could prompt the central bank to upgrade its growth projections again at next week\u2019s policy meeting. [12]\nCrucially for markets, Lagarde repeated that monetary policy is in a \u201cgood place\u201d, which investors interpret as a strong signal that no near\u2011term rate change is coming. [13]\nA fresh Reuters poll of 96 economists, released today, backs that view: [14]\n- All respondents expect the ECB to hold the deposit rate at 2% at the 18 December meeting.\n- Around 80% think rates will be unchanged through mid\u20112026, and nearly 75% expect no move until the end of 2026.\n- Eurozone inflation is seen easing from 2.2% now to about 2.1% in Q4 2025 and 1.7% in early 2026, remaining below the 2% target across 2026.\n- Growth is forecast to average around 1.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026, with downside risks from a softer labour market and potential disappointment on German fiscal stimulus.\nTaken together, the Fed and ECB setups suggest a higher\u2011for\u2011longer but stable rate environment for Europe: not a rapid eas"

                "body": "Date: 10 December 2025\nEuropean stock markets traded in a cautious, slightly negative range on Wednesday as investors positioned for the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s final policy decision of the year and digested a sharp repricing in euro\u2011area bond markets.\nThe pan\u2011European STOXX Europe 600 hovered around 578 points, essentially flat on the day after spending much of the session 0.1\u20130.2% lower and on track for a fourth straight session of minimal losses. [1]\nGermany\u2019s DAX slipped back from recent highs, closing around 24,048 points, a drop of roughly 0.5% from Tuesday and still close to its record\u2011high range. [2] Paris\u2019 CAC 40 drifted a few tenths of a percent lower, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 was little changed, reinforcing the impression of a wait\u2011and\u2011see market rather than outright risk aversion. [3]\nKey takeaways for EU stock markets today\n- European indices stalled: STOXX 600 was broadly flat around 578, with the DAX and CAC 40 modestly in the red as traders awaited the Fed\u2019s decision and updated projections. [4]\n- Bond yields at multi\u2011month highs: Germany\u2019s 10\u2011year yield climbed near 2.9%, its highest since March, as markets priced out further ECB cuts and embraced the idea that the rate\u2011cut cycle is ending. [5]\n- Insurers and industrials lagged on stock\u2011specific news, while energy, miners and renewables outperformed, supported by commodity prices and upbeat clean\u2011energy guidance. [6]\n- 2026 outlook remains constructive: Major strategists see double\u2011digit earnings growth for European companies next year, and targets such as 640 on the STOXX 600 imply further upside, even after strong 2025 gains. [7]\n- Valuations still cheaper than the U.S.: International and European equities trade at a marked discount to the S&P 500 on forward P/E ratios, despite outperforming in 2025 in many currencies. [8]\nMarkets today: muted moves, big event\nEuropean trading on 10 December was dominated by one question: how \u201chawkish\u201d will the Fed\u2019s widely expected rate cut be?\nFutures markets and economists broadly anticipate a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate later today, following an earlier cut in October. [9] But several Fed officials have openly questioned the need for further easing, and a backlog of U.S. economic data caused by the protracted government shutdown has injected extra uncertainty into the forecasts.

While S&P 500 (ES=F) and Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) plunged 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.\n(YM=F)\nIn extended trading, Oracle plunged more than 10% after the software giant reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations, raising fresh concerns about cloud-infrastructure demand and dealing a slight blow to the bullish mood that had gripped Wall Street earlier.\nThe broader market finished higher Wednesday after a split Fed voted to cut interest rates for the third time this year, lowering the federal funds target range to 3.5%\u20133.75%. Policymakers also signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell also hinted that a rate hike would be off the table while broadly talking up the US economy's strength.\nPowell said officials are \"well positioned to wait and see\" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures.\nEarnings reports continue this week with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU) all releasing on Thursday, rounding out an unpredictable season for AI and retail traders.

S&P futures slipped about 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell more than 2%.\nIn after-hours trading, Oracle shares tumbled 11% after the cloud computing company posted disappointing quarterly revenue and raised its spending forecast. The report added more fuel to the debate about how quickly tech companies will be able to see returns on their AI investments. Other AI plays were also trading lower in extended trading, including Nvidia, which was down 1%, and CoreWeave, which fell more than 3%.\nStocks rose in Wednesday's session and got a lift after a divided Fed announced an interest rate cut for the third time this year and ruled out a rate hike. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee cut its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a 3.5%-3.75% range and signaled a slower pace of rate cuts ahead.\nFed chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"'well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves\" and noted President Donald Trump's tariffs have been a driver of inflation.\nThe three major indexes closed in the green, with the 30-stock Dow jumping about 497 points, or nearly 1.1%. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks notched a record close. Smaller companies tend to benefit more from lower rates than larger companies because their borrowing costs are more closely linked to market rates.\nAlthough markets rallied toward the latter half of Wednesday's session, some investors suggest being cautious ahead given that the central bank remains in a wait-and-see mode over the path of future monetary policy.\n\"We're not surprised to see near term optimism in the markets given that the Fed continues to cut rates even though the economy is growing, however, we think the rose colored glasses may come off once investors realize that the path to lower interest rates may take longer \u2014 or may not materialize at all \u2014 to the extent that they believe it will,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.\nF.L.Putnam Investment Management chief market strategist Ellen Hazen said that greater uncertainty regarding future interest rates and conflicting data around the state of the U.S. economy could \"lead to higher volatility and risk premia across risk markets like equities as we go into 2026.\""

Omar, a Somali American and Trump target, said he \"needs serious help.\"\nPresident Donald Trump ramped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric in a speech on Tuesday night, repeatedly attacking Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar and complaining about immigration outside of Europe.\n\"Let's have a few from from Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. Do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime. The only thing they're good at is going after ships,\" Trump said as he addressed supporters in Pennsylvania.\nThe speech was billed as an event to sell his economic agenda, but quickly devolved into a campaign-style speech filled with derogatory insults.\nTrump specifically took aim at Omar, a Somali American who represents Minnesota. He appeared to purposefully mispronounce her name and referred to Omar's hijab as a turban.\n\"I love her, she comes in, does nothing but b----. She's always complaining. She comes from a country where, I mean, it's considered about the worst country in the world, right?\" Trump said.\n\"She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out,\" Trump added.\nHis supporters then launched into \"send her back\" chants about the congresswoman, who is an American citizen.\nOmar responded to the remarks, the latest in Trump's attacks on her and Somali immigrants, in a post on X late Tuesday.\n\"Trump\u2019s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help. Since he has no economic policies to tout, he\u2019s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment,\" she wrote.\nTrump admits to saying 's---hole countries'\nTrump on Tuesday also recalled a 2018 meeting in which he told a group of senators behind closed doors that the U.S. shouldn't accept immigrants from \"s---hole countries\" such as Haiti.\nWhen it was reported at the time, Trump himself flatly denied using the expletive.\n\"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor troubled country,\" Trump wrote on X, then known as Twitter.\nABC News reported that in the 2018 Oval Office meeting with senators, Trump expressed frustration over the visa lottery program and asked those in the room why they would want people from Haiti, Africa and other \"s---hole countries\" coming into the United States.\"\nIn his denial then, Trump accused Democrats in the meeting of making up comments attributed to him and said that he \"probably should record future meetings.\" Notably, the president back then did not deny he suggested that America should admit more immigrants from places such as Norway -- comments that were confirmed by multiple sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.\nBut in his speech on Tuesday, Trump embraced the expletive as he boasted about pausing immigration applications from what he called \"third-world countries\" including \"hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries.\"\nSomeone in the audience then yelled the word \"s---hole.\"\n\"I didn't say 's---hole,' you did,\" Trump quipped. \"Remember, I said that to the senators. They came in, the Democrats, they wanted to be bipartisan, so they came in and they said, 'This is totally off the record, nothing mentioned here, we want to be honest,' because our country was going to hell.\"\n\"And we had a meeting, and I say, 'Why is it we only take people from s---hole countries,' right? Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden? Just a few? Let's have a few from from Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. Do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.\"\nABC News' Justin Gomez and Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report."

                "body": "Nikkei 225 holds near 50,603 as BOJ signals clash with yen tailwinds\nThe Nikkei 225 ended Wednesday almost unchanged at 50,603, a flat close that reflected the market\u2019s ongoing tug-of-war between a more hawkish Bank of Japan and the continued support of a weaker yen. The index drifted without conviction as traders weighed comments from Governor Kazuo Ueda signaling inflation is nearing target against renewed strength in exporters benefiting from currency softness.\nHighlights\n- Nikkei closes flat at 50,603 as BOJ policy signals meet yen-driven inflows\n- Index holds above its 20-day EMA at 50,051 with higher lows forming\n- Resistance at 50,900 remains the key intraday breakout trigger\nThe session encapsulated the market\u2019s uneasy balance. BOJ tightening expectations pressured rate-sensitive names, while the weaker yen buoyed global manufacturers and kept foreign demand intact. With next week\u2019s BOJ meeting looming, equities traded cautiously as investors waited for clarity on policy direction.\nTrend remains intact as index stabilises above key support\nOn the daily chart, the Nikkei\u2019s broader structure remains constructive despite the lack of direction. The index continues to trade above the 20-day EMA at 50,051, which has served as a reliable short-term floor for two consecutive weeks. The deeper framework is firmer still, with the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day EMAs aligned in a steady upward slope, reflecting a market that retains medium-term momentum even as near-term sentiment cools.\nNikkei 225 index price dynamics (Source: TradingView)\nMomentum indicators confirm the stabilisation. The RSI has recovered to 55, showing that the November weakness is being absorbed as the market forms a series of higher lows. That recurring pattern points to strengthening resilience despite the hesitation that has defined December\u2019s early trade.\nIntraday charts show clear hesitation as traders await BOJ clarity\nShort-term movement on the 30-minute chart captures the stop-start nature of the week. The Nikkei has repeatedly struggled to reclaim the Supertrend resistance near 50,855, with each attempt faded by light selling. Yet sellers have been unable to break the index below the intraday support zone around 50,450. Parabolic SAR placements continue to flip frequently, illustrating a market caught between opposing catalysts.\nFor momentum traders, the structure remains clean. A decisive push above 50,900 would likely revive bullish participation and re-open the path toward 51,200, the region where the index stalled earlier this month. Until then, the market sits in consolidation, waiting for direction.\nBOJ expectations pressure tech while weaker yen lifts exporters\nSector performance mirrored shifting macro dynamics. Governor Ueda\u2019s remarks that inflation is approaching the BOJ\u2019s sustainable target sharpened expectations for a possible rate hike as early as next week. That pressure weighed heavily on high-valuation and rate-sensitive stocks. Shares of Lasertec, Disco and Advantest all posted notable declines, extending the drag from Japan\u2019s semiconductor complex. SoftBank added to the pullback with a 1% drop.\nOn the other side, the weaker yen provided a buffer. Global manufacturers saw renewed buying as currency conditions improved profit outlooks. Fanuc and Kawasaki Heavy led gains, while Tokyo Electron extended its recent rebound, helped by improving sentiment for chip demand.\nIn earlier coverage, we noted that the Nikkei\u2019s resilience hinged on holding the 20-day EMA while waiting for a decisive macro signal. The market has continued to defend that level, and today\u2019s flat finish reinforces that traders remain positioned for clarity rather than direction as the BOJ decision approaches.\nLatest Nikkei 225 News\n- Forex\n- Crypto"
