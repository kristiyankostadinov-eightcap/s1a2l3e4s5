Gold\u2019s strong year-to-date rally\u2014up over 60%\u2014has been powered by expectations for more Federal Reserve rate cuts, heavy central bank buying, and steady demand from exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, platinum retreated to $1,596.88 per ounce and palladium inched up to $1,476.97, highlighting a mixed environment for precious metals. The lack of major new economic data and ongoing moves away from the US dollar are feeding into gold\u2019s momentum, but the next big test for prices will be US consumer price index numbers and progress in US\u2013China trade negotiations, both of which could shift the broader market tone.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Inflation jitters spark fresh gold fever.\nGold\u2019s rally underscores just how sensitive global markets are to central bank shifts and trade headlines.

                "source": "The Globe and Mail",
                "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/KGC/pressreleases/35553182/where-will-gold-prices-go-now-and-what-is-the-impact-on-gold-stocks/",
                "body": "Gold Price Forecast & Gold Stock Impact\nGold has recently surged to record highs, capturing global investor attention as it trades nearUS$4,300 per ounce. This remarkable rally has been driven by a combination of economic uncertainty, expectations of interest rate cuts, and a resurgence in safe-haven demand amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. The precious metal\u2019s momentum has prompted major financial institutions such as HSBC and Bank of America to significantly raise their gold price forecasts, with some projecting that prices could reach as high as US$5,000 per ounce by 2026.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the primary catalyst behind gold\u2019s rally is the decline in real interest rates. When inflation-adjusted yields fall, the opportunity cost of holding gold, an asset that offers no interest decreases, making it more attractive to investors. With central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada, signaling further potential rate cuts in 2025/26, the environment remains supportive for gold. This monetary easing is expected to continue fueling demand as investors seek protection against potential inflationary pressures and currency devaluation.\nAnother key factor supporting gold\u2019s rise is the weakness in the U.S. dollar. Because gold is priced in dollars, a softer dollar enhances its appeal for non-U.S. investors, effectively increasing global demand. This inverse relationship has historically played a critical role in gold\u2019s performance, and the current dollar downtrend has further reinforced bullish sentiment across commodity markets.\nGeopolitical uncertainty also remains a major driver. Ongoing U.S.\u2013China trade tensions, regional conflicts, and rising concerns about sovereign debt levels have led investors to seek safe-haven assets as insurance against financial instability. Central banks have also been major contributors to this rally, with several countries continuing to diversify reserves away from the U.S. dollar by purchasing physical gold. Institutional investors have followed suit, increasing exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), further adding momentum to the rally.\nDespite these bullish factors, analysts caution that the market may be approaching an overextended phase. Technical indicators show that gold could experience a period of consolidation or a short-term correction, particularly if momentum weakens or profit-taking intensifies. According to some technical models, a retracement toward the US$3,500\u2013US$3,800 range would not be unexpected if inflation cools or if the Federal Reserve adopts a less dovish stance.\nIn the short term, the outlook for gold remains moderately positive. The World Gold Council projects a potential 0\u20135% upside under stable economic conditions, while more volatile scenarios, such as renewed inflation fears or heightened geopolitical risk could push prices 10\u201315% higher. Over the medium to long term, consensus forecasts place gold\u2019s average price between US$3,300 and US$3,600 per ounce by late 2025. In a bullish scenario, where monetary easing accelerates and fiscal imbalances deepen, prices could climb toward US$5,000 per ounce.\nFor investors, gold\u2019s recent performance reinforces its role as a strategic hedge in diversified portfolios. Those concerned about systemic risk, debt sustainability, or currency depreciation may find gold\u2019s long-term fundamentals compelling. However, given the rapid ascent in prices, investors might consider gradual accumulation or buying on pullbacks rather than chasing the rally at current highs.\nThe trajectory of gold prices will largely depend on how monetary policy, inflation trends, and geopolitical developments unfold over the next 12 to 24 months. While the potential for further gains remains, particularly if rate cuts deepen and global tensions persist, the likelihood of short-term volatility and profit-taking is increasing. Gold\u2019s climb is therefore best viewed not as a speculative surge"

It says gold will reach $5,000 per ounce by 2026, a striking prediction that is fueled by a global rush into gold.\nCentral banks, particularly in China and India, are aggressively accumulating gold to diversify reserves as confidence in the U.S. dollar wanes amid rising U.S. debt concerns. Geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and escalating U.S.-China trade disputes, are also pushing investors toward gold as a safe-haven asset. Persistent inflation, despite cooling in some regions, continues to erode purchasing power, making gold an attractive hedge.\nExpectations of looser monetary policies, with the Federal Reserve signaling potential rate cuts later this year and into 2026, further bolster gold\u2019s appeal. Robust demand from exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors and physical buyers in Asia adds to the momentum. Gold\u2019s historic breakthrough above $4,300 per ounce last week \u2014 a record high for the precious metal \u2014 underscores the urgency behind the move. Gold is up 60% in 2025, far outpacing even the stock market\u2019s rise.\nThe two stocks below, with their strong fundamentals and leveraged exposure to gold\u2019s rise, are must-buy opportunities to capitalize on this unprecedented rally.\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM)\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is a premier gold miner positioned to thrive as gold climbs to $5,000. Operating in stable jurisdictions like Canada, Finland, and Mexico, AEM produces 3.4 million ounces annually, with ambitious plans to boost output through expansions like Detour Lake and Odyssey.\nThe miner\u2019s all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $1,289 per ounce \u2014 among the industry\u2019s lowest \u2014 ensure massive margin expansion at higher gold prices. At $4,300 gold, AEM\u2019s free cash flow per share is robust at $4.50, but at $5,000, margins could exceed 60%, potentially doubling cash flow.\nEarlier this year, analysts at BMO Capital Markets resumed coverage of AEM with an outperform rating and a $181 per share price target at a time AEM was trading at $122 per share, citing Agnico\u2019s ability to generate significant free cash flow from high-margin, secure operations. Last week, Bank of America raised its price target to $226 per share.\nTrading at a forward P/E of 18x, below the sector average of 22x, AEM offers compelling value. Its strong balance sheet supports reinvestment in high-return projects and a growing dividend appealing to income-focused investors.\nUnlike peers in riskier regions, AEM\u2019s Tier 1 assets minimize geopolitical and operational disruptions, a critical edge in today\u2019s volatile world. Recent production upgrades, such as a 10% increase at its Nunavut operations, and a stellar environmental record enhance its reputation.\nAEM\u2019s disciplined cost management and exploration success, with new finds in Quebec, position it for sustained growth. As gold prices escalate, AEM\u2019s ability to deliver consistent results while scaling output makes it a top pick for investors seeking leveraged exposure to the gold rally.\nRoyal Gold (RGLD)\nRoyal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) offers a low-risk way to profit from gold\u2019s surge to $5,000 without mining challenges. As a streaming and royalty company, it funds miners upfront for discounted future gold, capturing 70% of price upside with zero operational costs. Its diversified portfolio spans over 50 producing assets, including Mount Milligan and Pueblo Viejo, generating around $600 million in EBITDA at current prices. At $5,000, RGLD\u2019s EBITDA could hit $1 billion, with cash flow per share of $8 rising 80%.\nAnalysts from CIBC and Bank of America recently boosted"

                "body": "Oil prices saw a notable decline on Monday as a complex mix of geopolitical, economic, and supply factors weighed heavily on market sentiment. Brent crude futures fell by 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, settling at $61.10 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped by 21 cents, also a 0.17 percent decrease, to $56.98 per barrel. These declines marked a continuation of oil\u2019s downward trend for the third consecutive week, intensifying fears over a global supply glut compounded by escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.\nU.S.-China trade tensions impact demand outlook\nThe escalating trade standoff between the world\u2019s two largest economies has significantly impacted energy demand forecasts. Recent re-imposition of U.S. import tariffs on China, along with sanctions targeting commodities like Chinese cooking oil, have heightened concerns about weakening economic growth in both countries. This, in turn, threatens to curb fuel consumption in key industrial and transport sectors, exacerbating worries about global energy demand.\nMarket analysts highlight that the renewed trade hostility casts uncertainty over economic growth prospects, which undermines demand for oil and other commodities. The World Trade Organization has urged both nations to ease tensions, cautioning that a prolonged split could reduce global economic growth by as much as 7 percent in the long term.\nRead more: Crude oil prices fall to $61.04 as oversupply concerns mount ahead of Trump-Putin summit\nOversupply concerns continue to dominate\nBeyond demand worries, the oil market remains burdened by significant supply surplus concerns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast a record supply glut of as much as 4 million barrels per day by 2026, driven by production hikes from OPEC+ members and non-OPEC countries amidst sluggish demand. This surplus represents nearly 4 percent of worldwide demand, a figure substantially higher than previous estimates and one that continues to pressure prices downward.\nLatest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. commercial crude inventories reaching a five-week high on October 10, standing at 423.8 million barrels\u2014up 0.8 percent year-on-year. Including stocks held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, total crude inventories hit a four-month peak, underscoring the persistence of oversupply across global markets. Although gasoline and distillate fuel stocks showed some decline, the overall picture remains bearish for oil prices.\nDespite easing geopolitical tensions from recent diplomatic developments, including an upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine conflict, oil prices have not found firm support. The potential thaw in some conflicts provides mixed signals: it reduces the geopolitical risk premium traditionally supporting oil prices, yet introduces new uncertainties about future energy supply arrangements.\nOPEC\u2019s strategic moves\nIn response to these market dynamics, OPEC is undertaking measures to reassess member countries\u2019 output capacity, moving away from traditional self-reporting to independent consultancy evaluations. This initiative aims to bring more transparency ahead of the 2026 production quota negotiations. OPEC\u2019s drive to increase production has contributed directly to the growing supply surplus, further complicating efforts to stabilize prices.\nBank of America analysts have noted a likely formation of an oil price floor around $55 per barrel, suggesting some investors see current levels as a buying opportunity amid the oversupply concerns. However, prices hovering below $60 may persist until market fundamentals shift, particularly supply-demand balance improvements and easing geopolitical uncertainties."

                "body": "China's crude oil storage flows slump in September: Russell\nBy Clyde Russell\nChina's crude oil stockpile flows dropped sharply in September as lower imports and higher refinery processing cut the surplus that was available for storage.\nChina's surplus of crude stood at 570,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September, down from 1.01 million bpd in August, according to calculations based on official data.\nThe decline in crude imports and the increase in refinery throughput are an example of how China smoothes out the volatility in oil prices.\nImports dropped in September to 11.5 million bpd, the lowest level since January, as refiners trimmed purchases after prices surged in June during the brief military conflict between Israel and Iran.\nCargoes arriving in September would largely have been arranged at a time when crude prices were elevated, with benchmark Brent futures hitting a six-month high of $81.40 a barrel on June 23.\nChina does not disclose the volumes of crude flowing into or out of its strategic and commercial stockpiles, but an estimate can be made by deducting the amount of oil processed from the total crude available from imports and domestic output.\nSeptember's domestic oil output was 4.32 million bpd, according to official data released on Monday, giving a total available to refiners from imports and local production of 15.82 million bpd.\nRefiners processed 15.25 million bpd in September, up from 14.94 million bpd in August, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThis means that there was a surplus of 570,000 bpd of crude in September.\nIt is worth noting that not all of the surplus crude was likely to have been added to storage, with some being processed in plants not captured by the official data.\nBut even allowing for gaps in the official data, it is clear that from March onwards, China was importing crude at a far higher rate than it needed to meet domestic fuel demand.\nFor the first nine months of the year, the average volume of surplus crude in China was 930,000 bpd, with the lower surplus in September causing the year-to-date number to drop from 990,000 bpd for the eight months to August.\nThe surplus has been built up after refiners made a rare draw on inventories in January and February, when processing rates exceeded available crude by about 30,000 bpd. This was the first time since September 2023 that throughput exceeded the amount of crude from imports and domestic output.\nThe draw on inventories at the start of 2025 came amid rising oil prices, with Brent futures reaching their highest point so far this year of $82.63 a barrel on January 15, having risen steadily from levels around $70 in early December.\nMORE STORAGE FLOWS\nThe question for the market is whether China will accelerate its crude stockpiling in light of the declining trend in oil prices.\nBrent crude dropped to a six-month low of $60.14 a barrel on October 17 and was trading at $61.12 in Asia on Monday.\nThat price is likely low enough to encourage Chinese refiners to continue building their inventories.\nBut there are other factors at work, including mounting pressure on China and India to substantially reduce the volume of Russian crude oil they buy as part of Western efforts to put pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\nIt is likely that China could source sufficient crude to keep stockpiling from other suppliers even if it does trim imports from Russia.\nPrices will be key to what happens next.\nIf oil prices remain in the current downtrend as the eight members of OPEC+ end the bulk of their voluntary production cuts, then history suggests Chinese refiners will move to absorb most of any available surplus.\nEnjoying this column?

                "body": "WTI holds losses near $57.00 due to OPEC+ oversupply concerns\n- WTI loses ground as OPEC+ members are expected to increase their production.\n- President Trump reiterated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would halt purchases of Russian Oil.\n- The data firm Kpler indicates that India\u2019s imports of Russian Oil are expected to rise about 20% in October.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price trims its recent gains from the previous session, trading around $57.00 per barrel during the Asian hours on Monday. Crude Oil prices face challenges amid concerns over rising global supply.\nLast week\u2019s International Energy Agency (IEA) report revealed expectations that the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, popularly known as OPEC+, may increase their production, citing its increase in projections for a market surplus.\nTraders pay attention to further development on India\u2019s decision to buy Russian Oil. US President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would stop purchasing Russian Oil, while warning that New Delhi would face \u201cmassive\u201d tariffs if it failed to comply, per Reuters.\nOn Thursday, a White House official said that India has cut its Russian Oil imports by half, but Indian sources have not witnessed any immediate reduction. Reuters also cited sources saying that Indian refiners have already placed orders for November loadings, including some scheduled for December arrival, suggesting that any reduction may only be reflected in import data from December or January.\nThe commodities data firm Kpler suggests that India's imports of Russian Oil are set to rise about 20% this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members"

WTI (CL=F) trades near $57.50 (+0.14%) and Brent (BZ=F) around $61.30 (+0.38%), reflecting a delicate equilibrium where every policy shift or refinery disruption immediately reverberates through pricing structures.\nOPEC+ Maintains Tight Grip With 137,000 bpd Increase\nOPEC and its allies opted for a minimal 137,000 barrels-per-day production rise for November 2025\u2014mirroring October\u2019s adjustment\u2014to preserve market stability rather than chase marginal demand. The restrained addition underscores an alliance strategy focused on revenue optimization and inventory control as global consumption slows.\nAnalysts interpret the consistent monthly increment as a signal that the cartel intends to test demand elasticity without flooding the market. Brent\u2019s modest uptick following the decision highlights trader approval for supply discipline.\nSaudi Strategy Anchors Market Confidence\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s pricing for Arab Light crude to Asian buyers held at $2.20 per barrel above the Oman/Dubai benchmark, contradicting expectations of a reduction. The move reflects confidence that Asian demand can absorb incremental volumes despite weakening macro conditions. Riyadh\u2019s steady pricing policy provides a psychological floor for Brent futures and supports regional refining margins, particularly in China and India.\nU.S. Offshore Expansion Offsets Shale Plateau\nWhile shale productivity declines, the U.S. offshore segment is surging. Federal forecasts expect Gulf of Mexico output to climb from 1.8 million bpd to 2.4 million bpd by 2027, driven by projects from BP (NYSE:BP) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). BP\u2019s $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe development alone will add roughly 80,000 bpd once operational. Technological gains have reduced offshore breakevens to near $35 per barrel, and some operators project costs could fall toward $20 per barrel, well below many shale regions\u2019 $48 average.\nThis structural shift transfers long-term U.S. supply growth from short-cycle shale to deepwater assets, intensifying competition for OPEC+ barrels through 2026.\nCorporate Adjustments Reveal Industry Stress\nPersistent sub-$70 Brent has triggered financial strain across supermajors. Collectively, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron, Shell (LON:SHEL), TotalEnergies (EPA:TTE) and BP will distribute about $108.5 billion to shareholders in 2025\u2014down from $112 billion a year earlier\u2014even as dividend sustainability thresholds hover near $80 Brent.\nExxonMobil plans workforce reductions of up to 25%, while TotalEnergies will scale back buybacks in Q4 2025. These steps show that producers remain trapped between investor payout expectations and deteriorating margins.\nAsian Demand Diverges as China and India Rebalance\nChina continues to expand storage capacity with 11 new crude sites (169 million barrels), ensuring steady offtake from OPEC suppliers. Roughly 37 million barrels of new tanks are already operational, enabling Beijing to exploit price dips for strategic accumulation.\nIndia\u2019s fuel demand slipped 0.5% m/m in September 2025 to 18.63 million tonnes, partly from its ethanol-blending expansion (E20 program). Refiners have pivoted toward Guyanese and Russian barrels, with several cargoes now settled in Chinese yuan, marking a subtle challenge to the petrodollar framework.\nNorth American Context: Record Output, Static Rigs\nU.S. crude output continues breaking records despite a stagnant rig count, underscoring efficiency gains in high-yield basins.

The pair depreciates as the Euro (EUR) struggles after Bloomberg reported on Saturday that S&P Global Ratings downgraded France\u2019s credit rating to A+ from AA-, citing \u201celevated\u201d budget uncertainty despite the government\u2019s submission of its 2025 draft budget.\nFrance has lost its AA- rating at two of the three major credit assessors in little more than a month, including downgrades from Fitch and DBRS. The downgrade came after a week of political turmoil in which French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu narrowly survived two no-confidence votes in parliament. To retain power, his new government was forced to abandon President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s widely unpopular 2023 pension reform.\nThe downside of the EUR/USD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure due to the ongoing US federal government shutdown. The government shutdown has stretched into its 19th day with no resolution in sight, as senators failed for the tenth time to break the impasse during Thursday\u2019s votes. It now stands as the third-longest funding lapse in modern US history.\nHowever, the US Dollar (USD) may limit its losses amid easing US-China trade tensions. US President Donald Trump said over the weekend that he wants China to buy soybeans at least in the amount they were buying before. Trump added that he believes China will make a deal on soybeans. \u201cWe can lower what China has to pay in tariffs, but China has to do things for us too,\u201d he added.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to meet in the coming days to ease tensions ahead of a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi later this month.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the "

                "body": "EUR/USD (EURUSD) Holds Above 1.1630 as Dollar Strength and ECB Caution Define Outlook\nThe EUR/USD pair closed the week near 1.1660, holding modestly above the crucial 1.1631 neckline that has emerged as the defining technical level for the pair. After dipping below 1.1700 early in the week amid stronger U.S. yields and renewed tariff optimism from Donald Trump, the euro regained footing as traders reassessed the dollar\u2019s overextension. The broader tone remains cautious \u2014 the euro is confined within a three-month range between 1.1580 and 1.1748, reflecting indecision over monetary direction from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.\nDollar Index Strength Returns as Yields Push Higher\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded from recent lows, climbing toward 98.60, after the 2-year Treasury yield rose above 3.45%, signaling renewed dollar demand. Trump's softer remarks on China tariffs temporarily soothed global risk sentiment, but underlying market focus remains on whether the Fed will follow through with its anticipated 25-basis-point cut at the October 29 FOMC meeting. A sustained dollar recovery above 99.00 could test euro resilience, with traders watching for any break below the 1.1630 threshold to signal renewed bearish pressure on EUR/USD.\nTechnical Battle Around 1.1631 Keeps Traders Divided\nThe EUR/USD structure is now defined by a short-term double bottom pattern that emerged after repeated rejections near 1.1631. The neckline around 1.1720 was briefly tested before profit-taking capped gains near 1.1748, a Fibonacci resistance aligned with the 78.6% retracement of the 2021\u20132022 decline. A daily close above 1.1748 would shift sentiment decisively bullish, exposing 1.1790 and later 1.1860 as potential upside objectives. Conversely, sustained weakness below 1.1630 would validate the bearish continuation sequence, projecting downside risk toward 1.1560 and 1.1480.\nEuro Sentiment Dampened by ECB Dovish Signals\nAcross Europe, ECB policymakers have maintained a subdued tone as inflation continues to drift toward 2.3%, giving little urgency to tighten policy. Markets now price in no rate hike until Q2 2026, with traders debating whether the ECB might resume limited bond purchases if eurozone growth stalls below 0.8%. The divergence with U.S. policy has kept euro demand limited, particularly as American yields stay elevated. European data also reflect cooling momentum \u2014 Germany\u2019s ZEW expectations slipped to 11.7, while the French PMI composite fell to 49.8, reinforcing the argument that monetary easing from the Fed may only modestly benefit the euro if Europe remains economically sluggish.\nCross-Asset Correlation: Gold and Bitcoin Complicate the Dollar\u2019s Path\nGold\u2019s correction from $4,380 to $4,200 and Bitcoin\u2019s rally above $106,000 have altered short-term capital flows, reducing immediate safe-haven demand for the euro. Historically, the EUR/USD tends to strengthen alongside falling gold prices as investors rotate back into U.S. assets, but this week\u2019s mixed moves have clouded that pattern. With global liquidity tightening, macro funds are using EUR/USD positions as partial hedges against volatility in digital assets and commodities. Analysts estimate over $1 trillion shifted from precious metals into dollar-linked assets in recent weeks \u2014 indirectly supporting the dollar but leaving the euro undervalued relative to its long-term fair value near 1.1820.\nEUR/JPY and EUR/CAD Movements Reveal Euro\u2019s Divergent Strength\nThe euro\u2019s resilience is more visible in cross-pairs. EUR/JPY remains structurally bullish, holding above 175.00 despite yen volatility and Japan\u2019s 300% surge in gold trading volume. This strength underscores how the euro maintains relative dominance against weaker counterparts. In contrast, EUR/CAD faces headwinds near 1.6230, where prior resistance now acts as support amid energy price stabilization. The divergence between these pairs suggests that EUR/USD weakness stems primarily from U.S. dollar s"

Moreover, the mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for an extension of the recent goodish recovery from the 1.3250-1.3245 region, or the lowest level since early August, touched last Tuesday.\nThe US Dollar (USD) struggles to capitalize on its gains registered on Friday amid expectations of further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) this year. Apart from this, economic risks stemming from a prolonged US government shutdown, global trade frictions, and signs of weakness in the US economy keep the USD bulls on the defensive. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor offering some support to the GBP/USD pair.\nMeanwhile, disappointing UK employment details released last week fueled speculations that the Bank of England (BoE) could continue cutting rates gradually. Adding to this, worries about the UK\u2019s fiscal outlook ahead of the crucial Autumn budget in November act as a headwind for the British Pound (GBP) and the GBP/USD pair. This, in turn, warrants some caution for bullish traders and positioning for any further gains.\nEven from a technical perspective, Friday's failure near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the September-October downfall makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying in order to confirm a near-term bottom for spot prices. Moving ahead, there isn't any relevant market-moving economic data due for release on Monday, either from the UK or the US, leaving the GBP/USD pair at the mercy of the USD price dynamics.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference betwee"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Steadies Near 1.34 as Traders Await Fed Cut and U.K. CPI\nSterling consolidates in a tight 1.3350\u20131.3495 range as inflation data and Fed policy define the next breakout direction | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Pound Faces Tight Range as Fed Cut Looms and UK Data Intensifies Volatility\nGBP/USD Stuck Between Fed Rate Cuts and Political Gridlock\nThe GBP/USD pair closed the week near 1.3424, clinging to modest gains after a volatile stretch marked by shifting sentiment and mounting uncertainty around the U.S. government shutdown. Despite a brief midweek rally that lifted the pair above 1.3450, traders retreated to defensive positions ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on October 29, where markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut.\nThe extended U.S. government shutdown has paralyzed official data flow, leaving traders dependent on private indicators like the S&P Global Flash Manufacturing PMI for direction. The lack of real economic signals from Washington is amplifying risk aversion, curbing sterling\u2019s upside momentum even as the U.S. dollar weakens across broader indices.\nUK Inflation and Retail Data Drive Domestic Sentiment\nUpcoming U.K. releases\u2014including Consumer Price Index (CPI), Retail Sales, and Manufacturing PMI\u2014will shape the pound\u2019s short-term trajectory. The Bank of England faces renewed inflationary pressure, with annual CPI expected to hover near 2.9%, still above the BoE\u2019s 2% target. Retail sales are forecast to contract by 0.3% month-over-month, reflecting cautious consumer behavior amid stagnant wage growth.\nThe pound\u2019s resilience in the face of mixed fundamentals has surprised some institutional desks. Traders note that GBP/USD remains within the 1.3350\u20131.3495 corridor, a tight equilibrium zone reflecting the market\u2019s reluctance to price aggressive moves before the Fed\u2019s decision. Technical analysts at London-based desks point out that a sustained break above 1.3490 could trigger momentum toward 1.3600, while a slip below 1.3350 risks a retracement toward 1.3250, the October lows.\nFed Policy Uncertainty Keeps Traders Defensive\nThe upcoming FOMC meeting is set to dominate global markets. The expected 25 bps rate cut has already been factored into the dollar\u2019s valuation, but traders remain focused on the Fed\u2019s forward guidance. The uncertainty surrounding how deeply the Fed will ease through the rest of 2025 keeps volatility high across major pairs, especially those sensitive to yield spreads like GBP/USD (FX:GBPUSD).\nShould the Fed signal further cuts into December, sterling could extend its recovery as rate differentials narrow. However, if the central bank adopts a more cautious stance, emphasizing inflation risks and fiscal instability from the ongoing shutdown, the greenback could regain strength, pushing the pair back toward the 1.3300 handle.\nU.S. Government Shutdown and Treasury Yield Dynamics\nThe prolonged U.S. shutdown has left critical agencies without funding, delaying official employment, retail, and inflation data. This absence of information has heightened market reliance on Treasury yields, which rose last week, with the 2-year yield surpassing 3.45%, reinforcing near-term dollar support.\nHowever, some traders view this yield rise as temporary. As fiscal pressure builds and the shutdown drags into its fourth week, expectations for deeper fiscal damage could weaken the dollar\u2019s structural foundation. This dynamic has kept GBP/USD from breaking lower despite soft U.K. data, suggesting the pair\u2019s downside remains limited unless U.S. yields surge above 3.60%.\nTechnical Outlook: Key Levels Define a Narrow Battlefield\nPrice action shows GBP/USD consolidating above its 50-day moving average (1.3370), signaling short-term stability but lacking momentum. The 1.3400\u20131.3450 band has acted as a pivot area for three consecutive sessions. Traders are watching 1.3360 as key short-term support\u2014failure to hold there could expose 1.3330, aligning with earl"

Traders now look to the RBA\u2019s tone, Governor Bullock\u2019s speech, and fresh US data for direction, with sentiment and technical levels hinting at potential upside momentum in the near term.\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Falls as Unemployment Hits 4-Year High\n- ASX 200 Outlook: RBA to Stay Cautious After Softer Employment Report\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Bad News Is Good News for ASX\n- Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, Dow Jones Outlook: Has The Dead Cat Bounced?\nAUD/USD Outlook: RBA and US Data to Drive Next Move for the Australian Dollar\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source:LSEG\nVolatility Eases but AUD/CHF and AUD/JPY Stay Active\nVolatility was slightly lower for the Australian dollar overall last week, though it remained elevated against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. AUD/CHF fell to its lowest level amid its most volatile week in six months, though it managed to pare losses on Friday to close down just 0.4%. While AUD/JPY endured its second most volatile week in six months, it effectively closed flat for a second consecutive week. Still, I had warned that the Japanese yen sell-off appeared stretched, and we\u2019ve now seen an impressive pullback over the past two weeks.\nLooking across Aussie dollar pairs overall, my hunch is that we\u2019ll see it retrace higher again this week. AUD/USD is back above the 200-day EMA, and last week\u2019s price action suggests demand resides around 0.6450.\nRBA and Australian Data in Focus\nLast week\u2019s softer employment report reignited hopes of a November RBA cut, though the central bank will almost certainly want to see the quarterly CPI figures on October 30 before committing to further easing. While Governor Bullock is set to speak at the Bradfield Oration on Thursday, the event has historically been used to focus on long-term economic themes \u2013 such as productivity, housing supply, or structural challenges \u2013 rather than to set near-term policy signals. Still, should she acknowledge two consecutively weaker employment reports, the Australian dollar could come under pressure.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: LSEG Investing.com.\nUS Data Could Sway Risk Appetite\nUS data is beginning to trickle in following the backlog caused by the recent government shutdown, with September\u2019s inflation figures pencilled in for release on Friday. However, the data may carry a higher degree of uncertainty or revision risk due to the disruption.\nS&P Global\u2019s flash PMI and the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey are also on the calendar and could attract greater attention given the general data vacuum. With the Fed now placing more weight on employment data than inflation, particular focus will fall on the PMI\u2019s employment sub-index, as any signs of weakness could raise expectations of a more dovish stance from the Fed.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: US Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS)\nAUD/USD Correlations\nThe Australian dollar appears to be taking its directional cue from Wall Street sentiment, with the 10-day correlation between AUD/USD and the S&P 500 sitting around 0.85. This has seen the usually tight relationship with the US dollar become non-existent over the past 10 days, with an effective correlation of zero. Also note the weak relationships with two-year yields, the Chinese yuan and copper over the past couple of weeks.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows two lower spikes from last week, suggesting demand around the 0.6440 area. With prices now back above the 200-day EMA and the monthly S1 pivot point, dips within last week\u2019s range may attract buyers looking for a short-term mean reversion higher.\nWith trend resistance nearby, I\u2019m not expecting a strong upside move at this stage.

The figure came in line with the market consensus.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Chinese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate rose 1.1% in Q3 after advancing 1.1% in the previous quarter, above the market consensus of 0.8% print.\nChina\u2019s annual June Retail Sales increased by 3.0% vs. 2.9% expected and 3.4% prior, while Industrial Production came in at 6.5% vs. 5.0% estimate and August\u2019s 5.2%.\nMeanwhile, the Fixed Asset Investment declined 0.5% year-to-date (YTD) year-over-year (YoY) in September vs an increase of 0.2% expected and a rise of 0.5% in the previous reading.\nAUD/USD reaction to China\u2019s data dump\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) edges slightly higher in an immediate reaction to the China\u2019s GDP and activity data.

China quarterly GDP is estimated to grow 0.8% in the third quarter (Q3), compared to an expansion of 1.1% in Q2. On an annual basis, the Chinese economy is forecast to expand 4.8% versus 5.2% prior.\nMeanwhile, Retail Sales are expected to show an increase of 2.9% year-over-year (YoY) in September, compared to 3.4% in the previous reading.

The pair gains ground as the US Dollar weakens due to the US federal government shutdown has entered its 19th day with no end in sight.\nIf data comes in better than expected, it could lift the Australian Dollar (AUD), with the first upside barrier seen at the October 15 high of 0.6523. The next resistance level emerges at the September 1 high of 0.6560, en route to the October 6 high of 0.6620.\nTo the downside, the October 10 low of 0.6472 will offer some comfort to buyers. Extended losses could see a drop to the July 31 low of 0.6424. The next contention level is located at the 0.6400 psychological level.\nGDP FAQs\nA country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the rate of growth of its economy over a given period of time, usually a quarter. The most reliable figures are those that compare GDP to the previous quarter e.g Q2 of 2023 vs Q1 of 2023, or to the same period in the previous year, e.g Q2 of 2023 vs Q2 of 2022. Annualized quarterly GDP figures extrapolate the growth rate of the quarter as if it were constant for the rest of the year. These can be misleading, however, if temporary shocks impact growth in one quarter but are unlikely to last all year \u2013 such as happened in the first quarter of 2020 at the outbreak of the covid pandemic, when growth plummeted.\nA higher GDP result is generally positive for a nation\u2019s currency as it reflects a growing economy, which is more likely to produce goods and services that can be exported, as well as attracting higher fore"

The pair sits at a technical and policy crossroads \u2014 a small nudge from risk sentiment, a BoJ comment or a US data surprise could determine the next clear direction.\nThis article breaks down what has happened to USD/JPY recently, why it matters, the principal drivers today, the likely scenarios for the coming days and the key levels traders should watch.\nAt time of writing, USD/JPY is trading near 150.8\u2013151.0. a touch above the psychological 150 level but well inside the broader trading range that has characterised the pair in recent weeks. This reading is consistent with live price services and market summaries.\nThe pair has shown recent intraday volatility, falling below 150 on some sessions (e.g. a low around 149.7 on 17 October) before recovering as risk sentiment ebbed and flowed.\nPolitical news in Tokyo.\nMarket chatter about likely changes to Japan's political leadership \u2014 including the rise of figures seen as supportive of fiscal stimulus \u2014 has been a focal point.\nThat political backdrop pushed investors to price in greater fiscal largesse and, in turn, a weaker yen in early October. More recently, however, political uncertainty has also encouraged safe-haven flows at times, creating intra-week whipsaws.\nBoJ prudence.\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has been careful not to telegraph firm moves ahead of meetings, preferring to wait for data.\nThat caution means the yen's path largely depends on whether the BoJ begins to normalise policy and how aggressively markets expect any tightening.\nUS dynamics.\nOngoing expectations around Fed rate cuts and periodic easing in US risk perceptions (for example, when regional banking stresses recede) have weakened dollar momentum.\nWhen US yields fall, USD/JPY often drifts lower. Conversely, a resilient US data run or hawkish Fed surprise can lift the dollar.\nTechnical and trading flows.\nThe pair has been sensitive to technical levels \u2014 the 150 handle has acted as both support and resistance in recent sessions \u2014 while some leveraged carry positions have been reduced as volatility rose.\nThis combination has produced choppy trades rather than a steady trend.\nUSD/JPY stays between 149\u2013152 as markets wait for clearer signals from the BoJ, US economic data and Japan's political process.\nRationale: mixed policy signals and modest risk appetite keep traders cautious; technical levels contain moves.\nRisk-off shock or accelerating expectations of earlier BoJ tightening push USD/JPY below 148. with potential tests of 146.3 if selling intensifies.\nRationale: safe-haven flows and unwind of carry trades deepen the move.\nConfirmation of pro-stimulus Japanese government policy combined with dovish BoJ messaging and an improved US growth outlook sends USD/JPY back above 152\u2013153.\nRationale: fiscal expansion expectations, plus any US-China thaw that boosts risk appetite, could favour the dollar/weak yen trade.\nJapanese importers and consumers.\nA weaker yen raises import costs (energy, commodities), putting upward pressure on domestic inflation and household bills.\nExporters.\nA softer yen normally helps exporters' competitiveness and reported profits, which can be supportive for equities.\nFX traders and hedge managers.\nGreater intraday volatility means both risk and opportunity; active hedging of currency exposures becomes more important near policy or political events.\nMonetary authorities.\nLarge, rapid FX moves can prompt official comments or, in extreme cases, intervention \u2014 authorities have publicly signalled they would consider intervention if moves were disorderly.\nBank of Japan meeting and commentary (next BoJ meeting dates and any change in forward guidance).\nKey US macro prints (inflation, payrolls and ISM data) that alter Fed rate expectations.\nJapanese political calendar \u2014 steps in coalition formation, budget ann"

Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen Steadies at 150.61 as Japan\u2019s Political Rift and BoJ Policy Jitters\nThe yen\u2019s volatility deepens ahead of Japan\u2019s leadership vote and BoJ speeches as the pair hovers above 150, while U.S. CPI and labor data threaten to push USD/JPY toward 155 or break support near 147.5 | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY (\u00a5150.61) Holds Firm as Political Upheaval and Global Trade Friction Test Market Nerves\nThe USD/JPY pair ended the week at \u00a5150.61, down 0.34%, after a volatile session that saw prices briefly dip below the psychological \u00a5150 mark before rebounding from \u00a5149.35. The pair\u2019s whipsaw behavior reflected an unusual blend of political uncertainty in Japan, ongoing U.S.\u2013China tariff tensions, and renewed speculation about the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) next policy move. The breakdown of Japan\u2019s long-standing LDP\u2013Komeito coalition triggered a wave of risk aversion early in the week, temporarily lifting the yen as investors sought safety. However, renewed U.S. dollar demand, supported by steady Treasury yields, helped the pair recover above 150, even as traders braced for a pivotal political week in Tokyo.\nJapan\u2019s Political Realignment and BoJ Policy Outlook Intersect at Critical Juncture\nThe upcoming October 21 parliamentary vote could prove decisive for both yen stability and BoJ policy. The LDP currently holds 196 seats, falling short of the 233-seat majority, and a possible alliance with Ishin could raise that number to 231, leaving just two additional seats to control the chamber. Such an outcome would likely reinforce the ultra-loose stance favored by leadership contender Sanae Takaichi, whose prior monetary views propelled USD/JPY to \u00a5153.27, its highest since February. Conversely, a fractured or unstable coalition could invite a stronger yen amid political hesitation and policy recalibration.\nMarket participants remain sharply focused on the BoJ\u2019s policy communication, with officials Hajime Takata (Oct 20) and Ryozo Himino (Oct 21) expected to comment on both the domestic political backdrop and the inflation trajectory. Their tone will determine whether the BoJ maintains its accommodative stance or signals a modest tightening bias before year-end.\nJapanese Trade and Inflation Data Reinforce Fragile Balance\nJapan\u2019s external sector continues to reflect fragile demand conditions. The most recent trade figures show exports and imports contracting 0.1% and 0.5% year-on-year, respectively, underscoring the drag from global trade friction and reduced U.S. demand following the new 15% U.S. tariff adjustment on Japanese goods. A rebound in export volumes, particularly in machinery and automobiles, would ease pressure on the BoJ, though early signs suggest the recovery remains shallow.\nInflation remains a more pressing issue. Economists expect Japan\u2019s headline CPI to rise from 2.7% to 2.9% in September, while core-core inflation\u2014excluding fresh food and energy\u2014is forecast to slip slightly from 3.3% to 3.2%. The persistence of inflation well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target supports arguments for gradual normalization. Yet, policymakers remain wary of tightening too quickly amid political instability and fragile consumption.\nThe S&P Global Services PMI, projected to fall from 53.3 to 53.0, may carry even more weight than inflation data. With the services sector comprising over 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP, any meaningful contraction would bolster dovish sentiment, reinforcing expectations that the BoJ will maintain near-zero rates into early 2026.\nU.S. Data and Fed Outlook: Dollar Strength Tested by Inflation and Shutdown Risk\nAcross the Pacific, U.S. economic indicators continue to dominate global currency flows. The U.S. CPI report, due October 24, is expected to show a modest acceleration in headline inflation to 3.1%, up from 2.9%, while the government shutdown delays critical labor and retail data. Should inflation overshoot while jobless claims remain low, markets could scale back expectations for Fed rate cuts in December, lifting"

The pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) struggles due to the ongoing US federal government shutdown. Traders will likely observe the Bank of Canada (BoC) Business Outlook Survey later in the day.\nThe US government shutdown has stretched into its 19th day with no resolution in sight, as senators failed for the tenth time to break the impasse during Thursday\u2019s votes. It now stands as the third-longest funding lapse in modern US history.\nHowever, the US Dollar (USD) may limit its losses amid easing US-China trade tensions. US President Donald Trump said over the weekend that he wants China to buy soybeans at least in the amount they were buying before. Trump added that he believes China will make a deal on soybeans. \u201cWe can lower what China has to pay in tariffs, but China has to do things for us too,\u201d he added.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to meet in the coming days to ease tensions ahead of a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi later this month.\nThe downside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could face challenges amid weaker Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price trims its recent gains from the previous session, trading around $57.00 per barrel at the time of writing.\nOil prices struggle amid concerns over rising global supply, following last week\u2019s International Energy Agency (IEA) report expecting OPEC+ members to increase their production, citing its projections for a market surplus.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This "

Crude Oil prices face challenges amid concerns over rising global supply.\nLast week\u2019s International Energy Agency (IEA) report revealed expectations that the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, popularly known as OPEC+, may increase their production, citing its increase in projections for a market surplus.\nTraders pay attention to further development on India\u2019s decision to buy Russian Oil. US President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would stop purchasing Russian Oil, while warning that New Delhi would face \u201cmassive\u201d tariffs if it failed to comply, per Reuters.\nOn Thursday, a White House official said that India has cut its Russian Oil imports by half, but Indian sources have not witnessed any immediate reduction. Reuters also cited sources saying that Indian refiners have already placed orders for November loadings, including some scheduled for December arrival, suggesting that any reduction may only be reflected in import data from December or January.\nThe commodities data firm Kpler suggests that India's imports of Russian Oil are set to rise about 20% this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members"

The country saw a net inflow of C$25.9 billion in August, the largest in over a year, and it was almost entirely into debt. Not government debt, but corporate debt issued in U.S. dollars. The issue creates two major problems for the Bank of Canada: weaker demand for the loonie, and reduced sensitivity to domestic monetary policy. This means rate cuts are unlikely to stimulate the economy as intended.\nCanadian Real Estate Sellers Flooded The Market With Record Inventory\nCanadian real estate sellers flooded the market last month. A minor increase in sales wasn\u2019t enough to make a difference against nearly 92,000 new listings across Canada in September, 20% higher than the 10-year average for the month. The result was the weakest sales to new listings ratio for September since 1995, a period well associated with Canada\u2019s largest housing correction.\nCanadian New Vehicle Sales Flash Another Recession Sign\nCanada was hit with another recession warning\u2014weak demand for new motor vehicles. New vehicle sales fell 7.1% in August, the largest drop for the month since 2010. The average sale price also slipped by $4,000 since the peak in December 2024. Slipping demand for durable goods like homes, vehicles, and even tools, is typically observed at the end of the business cycle, preceding a recession.\nCanadian Real Estate Developers Pull Back As Risks Rise Faster Than Incentives\nCanadian homebuilders are pulling back despite the surge in taxpayer-fuelled incentives. The value of permits fell 2.4% to $7.01 billion in August, down (-7.9%) when adjusted for inflation. Even with policymakers launching unprecedented incentives to build, developers are pulling back\u2014a clear sign that risk greatly outweighs record stimulus."

                "body": "The US dollar\u2019s latest rebound continues to look corrective rather than the start of a broader trend reversal. Despite failing to close above key resistance levels, the greenback has shown resilience, holding support near its 50-day EMA.\nWith the weekly RSI still below 50, the dollar\u2019s upside may be capped, but short-term momentum could strengthen as US data are backfilled following the government shutdown. This could see EUR/USD and GBP/USD come under renewed pressure if the dollar bounce gains traction.\nView related analysis:\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY\n- US Dollar, Yields Lower After Powell Comments, GBP/USD Holds Ground\n- Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, Dow Jones Outlook: Has The Dead Cat Bounced?\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Bulls Reclaim 200-Day, US CPI Looms\n- AUD/USD Q4 Outlook: Bears Target Slower Growth, RBA Cut\nUS Dollar Strength Could Limit Upside for EUR/USD and GBP/USD\nUS Dollar Technical Outlook\nI\u2019ve outlined in several recent articles that the current rebound in the US dollar appears to be a corrective move against its decline from the January high to the June low. For now, I expect this correction to terminate below the August high, which itself sits beneath the 100 handle.\nLast week\u2019s bearish inside candle marked the second consecutive week the US dollar index failed to close above the 200-week EMA, and the fifth straight week of alternating candle colours \u2013 a hallmark of corrective price action.\nWith the weekly RSI still below 50, it\u2019s possible the corrective high is already in place. However, volatility could increase in either direction as US economic data are backfilled once the government shutdown is presumably resolved.\nThat said, I see potential for a short-term bounce in the US dollar index, given it held above the 50-day EMA and the 98 handle on Friday. The daily RSI (2) dipped into oversold territory, while the RSI (14) remains above 50 \u2013 a combination that favours the bears in the near term, and poses headwinds for GBP/USD and EUR/USD.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView U.S. Dollar Index Futures (DX1!)\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis: Euro vs US Dollar\nThe daily chart shows that EUR/USD snapped a 3-day rally on Friday, closing the day back beneath the 20 and 50-day day EMAs. The bearish day also marks the second candle of a 2-bar bearish reversal (dark cloud cover) to warn of a near-term dip.\nI\u2019m not looking for a particularly deep pullback on EUR/USD, but bulls could seek dips towards the 1.16 handle in anticipation of a higher low above last week\u2019s lows. However. A high-volume node (HVN) sits around 1.1622 on the 1-hour chart. Also note the monthly S1 pivot point (1.1582) and 100-day EMA (1.1580) for additional support if needed. The monthly pivot point (1.1753) and 1.1779 high makes a viable upside target for bulls.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/USD\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs US Dollar\nLast week\u2019s bias for a rebound from the 200-day EMA towards the lower VPOC played out well, with GBP/USD reaching the downside objective on Thursday before forming a doji (indecision candle) on Friday. While this could point towards a potential pullback for the British pound, the strength of last week\u2019s advance suggests any retracement may be shallower than that seen in EUR/USD. In turn, this suggests EUR/GBP could trade lower this week if these assumption prove to be correct.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that much of the buying volume occurred in the upper half of the rally, which again implies that any dip could be limited.\nGBP/USD bulls may look for opportunities to buy dips towards Friday\u2019s low while maintaining a near-term bullish bias, provided prices hold above the weekly pivot point at 1.3381. Upside targets include the September VPOC at 1.3516, which aligns closely with the weekly R1 pivot level.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView GBP/USD\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFo"

The Japanese Yen (JPY) softens against the Euro (EUR) as the dovish Sanae Takaichi is poised to become the first female Prime Minister.

A parliamentary vote to choose a prime minister is set for Tuesday. Sanae Takaichi is expected to become Japan's next Prime Minister, raising market expectations for big spending and loose monetary policy. Traders anticipate that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would further delay raising interest rates, which would drag the JPY lower and act as a tailwind for the cross.\nTechnically, the constructive outlook of EUR/JPY remains in place, with the price being well-supported above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart. The upward momentum is reinforced by the 14-day Relative Strength Index, which stands above the midline near 56.85. This suggests that further upside looks favorable in the near term.\nOn the bright side, the first upside barrier emerges in the 176.90-177.00 zone, representing the high of October 13 and the psychological level.

The additional downside filter to watch is 171.25, the 100-day EMA.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nEUR/JPY daily chart\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian "

However, he explained that \u201cwhile the possibility of bitcoin retesting its record highs around $124,000 or climbing slightly higher cannot be ruled out, the broader trend has now flipped bearish.\u201d\nHis analysis is based on the Elliott Wave Theory. Proposed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938, this theory interprets price movements as five upward waves and three corrective waves, assuming investor sentiment follows repetitive cycles. Applying this theory, he explained that Bitcoin\u2019s drop below $105,000 last week marked the end of the bull market.\nAdditionally, Glover stated that this outlook aligns with past patterns where Bitcoin peaks around 18 months after a halving event before entering a bear market. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024."

That means exchanges can list qualifying crypto ETPs without submitting a separate rule filing for each product \u2014 a structural change that ends years of case-by-case limbo.\nThe impact of this development cannot be overstated, and should be on the short list of industry breakthroughs \u2014 along with moments like CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures debut in 2017, Coinbase\u2019s Wall Street listing in 2021, the Ethereum Merge in 2022 and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024.\nHere are four reasons why this is a watershed moment for crypto.\n1. Shorter Timelines Make New ETPs More Viable\nPreviously, each ETP required a drawn-out SEC review, which could take up to 240 days. Under the new rules, new products that meet preset criteria can launch in as little as 75 days. In regulatory terms, that\u2019s lightspeed.\nThis shrinks uncertainty and carrying costs for issuers, which is critical because launching an ETF ties up real money and resources. Seed capital, legal/registration fees, listing and ongoing marketing expenses are all costs that add up while a filing sits in limbo. Shortening the clock makes more strategies economically viable and the pipeline is filling. A flurry of spot-coin ETFs are expected under the streamlined framework \u2014 not just BTC and ETH, but also SOL, XRP and others.\nFor an industry long stuck in limbo, the starting gun has fired.\n2. Advisors Can Finally Put Crypto in Portfolios\nUntil now, accessing crypto in a traditional portfolio was tricky. A handful of bitcoin and ether funds emerged in the last two years, but many mainstream brokerages and RIAs shied away from crypto. A notable example is $10 trillion asset manager Vanguard, which has refused to offer clients access to spot bitcoin ETFs. This conservative stance left untold investors on the sidelines, and left advisors with few compliant options.\nThe new SEC rule change blows open the doors for these investors and advisors. With a streamlined path for diversified crypto ETFs, advisors can finally offer index-like crypto exposure via familiar platforms. Within 48 hours of the rule change, Grayscale secured approval to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund into the Grayscale Crypto 5 ETF (although it remains under a stay pending final clearance to begin trading) enabling its clients to invest in a basket of the five largest coins. With such products, a wealth manager can now allocate to crypto just as they would to an S&P 500 or gold fund.\nIn practice, this normalization of crypto within a standard brokerage account means retirees can hold digital assets in their IRA alongside stocks and bonds. Or that RIAs can rebalance into crypto without operational gymnastics or compliance nightmares.\n3. Regulated ETPs Unlock Crypto\u2019s Integration with Banking\nBeyond accessibility, this development deepens crypto\u2019s integration with traditional finance.\nWhen digital assets live inside regulated wrappers, they can plug into the existing financial system in powerful ways. JPMorgan Chase, leadership of which was long skeptical of crypto, recently announced it will accept crypto ETF shares as loan collateral \u2014 similar to margin loans using stock ETFs as backing.\nWith more ETPs subject to standard custody and reporting, banks can more comfortably lend against these assets. The ability to borrow against crypto holdings makes crypto an active participant in banking and "

                "body": "Bitcoin\u2019s Halving Cycle Is Fading as ETFs Take Over the Market\n- Over $60 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT leading the charge and reshaping market structure.\n- Traditional indicators like halving cycles, miner activity, and exchange inflows are losing relevance as institutions dominate.\n- Bitcoin\u2019s new bear market floor is estimated between $75K and $80K, supported by ETF demand and global liquidity trends.\nBitcoin\u2019s legendary halving cycle\u2014the one that used to define every bull and bear market\u2014is starting to lose its grip. With over $60 billion pouring into spot Bitcoin ETFs, led mostly by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, the game has changed. Institutional demand, global liquidity, and derivatives are now pulling the strings. The old rules of \u201cwait for the halving, then buy\u201d might not mean much heading into 2026.\nETFs Are Rewriting Bitcoin\u2019s Price Story\nFor years, miners were at the center of Bitcoin\u2019s market rhythm. Every four years, their rewards halved, and prices soared soon after. But now, ETFs are the ones driving price formation. Since the US greenlit Bitcoin spot ETFs, money has flooded in\u2014over $60 billion worth. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT sits at the top, not just with the largest assets under management but also leading in ETF-linked options trading. The U.S. alone now accounts for around 90% of all global spot Bitcoin ETF holdings.\nJames Check, co-founder of Checkonchain Analytics, summed it up perfectly: \u201cSome holders are moving from on-chain to ETFs\u2026 but demand\u2019s been massive.\u201d It\u2019s a subtle shift that\u2019s actually huge\u2014Bitcoin\u2019s pricing power is now more about institutional flows than miner rewards.\nOld Metrics Are Losing Their Edge\nExchange inflows used to be a go-to signal for market trends, but not anymore. Even as Bitcoin hits new all-time highs, exchange inflows are sitting at record lows. Analysts say much of that data is flawed anyway since so many exchange wallets remain unidentified. \u201cYou won\u2019t see me use exchange data often\u2014it\u2019s just not a great tool,\u201d James admitted.\nMiner selling? Barely noticeable. With daily issuance down to around 450 BTC, it\u2019s nothing compared to long-term holders who can offload tens of thousands at once. On-chain charts barely even register miner activity anymore. It\u2019s clear: the market\u2019s direction isn\u2019t being set by miners or exchanges\u2014it\u2019s driven by institutions, ETFs, and the slow churn of long-term holders.\nRealized Price and Market Floors Are Evolving\nTraditionally, investors looked to metrics like Realized Price to spot market bottoms. But that number includes ancient wallets\u2014some probably lost forever, like Satoshi\u2019s. Today, the Realized Price sits around $52K, but no one really thinks Bitcoin will drop that low again. James believes a \u201cbear market\u201d floor now sits closer to $75K\u2013$80K, supported by ETF inflows and corporate treasuries buying at those levels.\nEven popular metrics like MVRV Z-Score aren\u2019t hitting the same. They still matter, but analysts say thresholds need tweaking to reflect how deep and institutionalized Bitcoin\u2019s market has become. The real signals now come from liquidity trends, derivatives volume, and how large entities position their portfolios.\nBitcoin Follows Liquidity, Not Just Halvings\nGlobal liquidity has become Bitcoin\u2019s new pulse. As ETFs mature, options and derivatives built on top of them are becoming the real engines of price discovery. Vanguard is reportedly preparing its own ETF next, which could push this even further. \u201cThe ETFs are big,\u201d said James, \u201cbut the options market around them\u2014that\u2019s where the real action is.\u201d\nEven sovereign funds and pensions are dipping their toes in. While still early, their presence marks a turning point. Most of these ETFs are held through Coinbase, raising questions about centralization, though the network\u2019s proof-of-work model still ensures security and decentralization at the protocol level.\nAt this stage, Bitcoin isn\u2019t just reacting to crypto-specific events\u2014it\u2019s moving with global liquidity, interest "

Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott initially expected passage by late September, but partisan divisions have descended into accusations of bad-faith negotiating.\nFor crypto markets, regulatory uncertainty extends the information vacuum, and when frameworks shift and rules remain unclear, traders who can monitor sentiment and capital flows in real time hold decisive advantages over those waiting for headlines. That\u2019s why DeepSnitch AI has enormous purchase right now, offering AI-driven intelligence that functions regardless of regulatory outcomes.\nETH ETFs diverge from Bitcoin as institutional appetite shifts\nEthereum ETFs recorded $5.32 million in net inflows on October 15, pushing cumulative inflows to $14.72 billion even as Bitcoin ETFs bled $94 million in outflows. The divergence suggests institutions view ETH differently than BTC, particularly with the SEC\u2019s October 23 deadline looming for decisions on 16 crypto ETF applications, including products that would enable staking functionality.\nIf regulators approve ETH staking rewards within ETF structures, institutional investors could earn yield while holding exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency, a feature Bitcoin products cannot replicate. That potential differentiation could accelerate adoption among pension funds and endowments seeking income generation alongside capital appreciation.\nThe contrasting flows between BTC and ETH ETFs signal that institutional stories are getting tangled. Bitcoin remains digital gold, but Ethereum\u2019s programmability and staking yield offer additional value propositions that appeal to different allocators.\nFor retail traders, the question becomes whether Ethereum network upgrades can drive price appreciation fast enough to compete with early-stage AI projects offering 100x potential from sub-$0.02 entry prices.\nBest crypto to buy now\nDeepSnitch AI: AI surveillance that levels information asymmetry\nOctober\u2019s momentum is lifting AI sector tokens even as regulatory uncertainty weighs on majors. DeepSnitch AI sits at the convergence of two explosive trends, blockchain adoption and artificial intelligence growth. Audited by both Coinsult and SolidProof, the platform offers security transparency that separates legitimate projects from cash grabs, prolonging fundraising without delivering products.\nDeepSnitch AI will deploy five agents trained on blockchain data and token mechanics to clarify on-chain confusion and deliver clear answers directly through Telegram. Instead of spending hours researching contract addresses, liquidity locks, and developer histories, users will ask questions in plain language and receive instant analysis backed by real-time data.\nTogether, the AI agents are likely to become more and more valuable as markets get more complex, creating utility that compounds rather than dilutes over time. The presale crossed $429K at $0.01915, and the staking program allows early participants to earn rewards, with free withdrawals and zero lock-up periods once claiming opens post-presale.\nWhile Ethereum price prediction models target $4,800 to $5,000 near term, those gains represent 20% to 25% from current levels. DeepSnitch AI, priced for asymmetric returns, offers potential for 100x if the AI agents prove indispensable when markets turn volatile again.\nEthereum: Network upgrades support long-term bull case\nEthereum price prediction analysts point toward $4,500 to $4,650 by mid-October if ETH sustains above $4,000 support, with potential extension toward $4,800 later this month if volume supports breakout attempts.

CoinGecko calls it a defining market shift.\nWhat to know:\n- Ethereum (ETH) led crypto's Q3 rally as investors shifted focus from bitcoin to altcoins, DeFi, and tokenized assets.\n- The crypto market added over $500 billion in value, marking its second consecutive quarter of growth, largely without bitcoin at the forefront.\n- CoinGecko's report highlights a broader reshaping of investor interest, with Ethereum gaining ground and new on-chain financial products gaining traction.\nEthereum\nThe broader market added over half a trillion dollars in value, its second straight quarter of meaningful growth, but this time, it wasn\u2019t bitcoin leading the charge. Instead, investors looked to ethereum\nAt the start of July, it looked like bitcoin would again set the pace. Its price hit new highs early in the quarter, buoyed by retail interest and institutional inflows through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nBut by September, the narrative had changed. While bitcoin cooled off, ether caught fire.\nA combination of ETF demand, growing interest in tokenized real-world assets, and renewed attention from corporate treasuries helped ETH hit a fresh all-time high before settling back.\nThat shift in focus was one of the quarter\u2019s defining trends, analysts at CoinGecko wrote.\nTrading activity, which had fallen for two straight quarters, snapped back with strength. Spot volumes surged across centralized and decentralized exchanges. But the story wasn\u2019t just about volume, it was about where that volume was going.\nMeme coins, long considered fringe, made a dramatic return with tokens like M climbing the charts. Stablecoins like USDe gained ground, and lesser-known altcoins entered the top 30 by market cap. DeFi, which had faded from the spotlight in late 2024, mounted a comeback as total value locked in lending and staking protocols climbed alongside Ethereum\u2019s rise, according to the report.\nA shift in investor appetite\nBehind the scenes, structural shifts were taking shape.\nBitcoin\u2019s share of the total crypto market declined, a sign that investor appetite had moved toward other narratives. Ethereum gained ground, but so did categories that had struggled to break through in previous years, particularly tokenized assets.\nA new generation of on-chain stocks and bonds began to take hold, and protocols like Ondo and Backed Finance gained traction with investors looking to bridge traditional and decentralized finance.\nBitcoin also became less tied to legacy markets. Its price movement decoupled from the S&P 500 for the first time in over a year. That could be read as a positive, the report stated, and proof that crypto is becoming a more independent asset class. But it also reflects how investor attention has fragmented, the report stated.\nEven the mining sector reflected this changing dynamic. Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate hit record highs, and miner-focused ETFs posted strong returns.\nHowever, the spotlight was elsewhere: on emerging tokens, Ethereum\u2019s momentum, and the rebirth of DeFi, the report found.\nMore For You\nStablecoin payment volumes have grown to $19.4B year-to-date in 2025.

                "body": "Solana continues to solidify its dominance as a preferred blockchain for decentralized applications, with Grayscale\u2019s latest report emphasizing its growing role in the global crypto ecosystem.\nThe network has evolved into a central hosting platform for major decentralized projects like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Helium, attracting both developers and investors seeking scalable blockchain solutions. Its ability to process high transaction volumes at a low cost has become one of its defining strengths.\nExpanding Ecosystem and Developer Growth\nSource: X\nThe Solana ecosystem generates approximately $425 million in monthly fees, translating to more than $5 billion annually. This strong revenue base demonstrates the network\u2019s growing on-chain activity and adoption. Unlike other blockchains facing congestion and high fees, Solana\u2019s average transaction cost remains around $0.02, making it appealing for both users and developers.\nBesides its economic performance, Solana\u2019s human capital continues to grow. The network now has more than 1,000 full-time developers, second only to Ethereum. This expanding developer base is fostering rapid innovation, with projects spanning DeFi, consumer apps, and digital infrastructure.\nRaydium operates as a decentralized exchange on Solana, while Pump.fun has become a key platform for consumer-focused blockchain activity. Helium, another prominent project, utilizes Solana for mobile hotspot networks. Together, these applications illustrate Solana\u2019s versatility and strong developer engagement.\nTechnical Strength and Investor Appeal\nSolana\u2019s technical design remains one of the fastest among smart contract blockchains. New blocks are produced every 400 milliseconds, and transactions reach finality within 13 seconds.\nThis combination of speed and reliability enhances user experience and supports broader adoption across industries. Consequently, the network\u2019s consistent performance has helped it stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nFrom an investment perspective, Solana\u2019s tokenomics present an attractive balance between inflation and yield. The annual supply growth of SOL tokens stands between 4% and 4.5%, while staking rewards average about 7%.\nSource: X\nHence, investors who stake SOL earn real returns between 2.5% and 3%. These figures reflect a sustainable incentive model that encourages long-term participation in the network."

The Remittix DeFi project positions itself as the best crypto presale of 2025, with real utility, low gas fee crypto design, and a clear path to Centralized exchanges and a future Decentralized exchange listing. RTX offers an early-stage crypto investment with simple ways to buy the RTX token, community rewards, and a roadmap built for scale.\nSolana remains in focus as traders defend a key zone near $183. A clean bounce here can set a path back to $186 to $188, then $190, plus if momentum builds. If the level breaks, Solana may revisit lower support first, which would keep the range in play. For now, the Solana trend is neutral to bullish, helped by strong network activity, a rising TVL base, and steady stablecoin volume.\nUniswap's integration improves cross-chain swaps for Solana users, while Circle's new USDC issuance adds depth across markets. A potential Solana ETF is another tailwind that could attract traditional capital. In short, Solana is still one of the top cryptos to buy now for builders who want low fees and speed, but traders should respect the $182 to $183 floor while the chart settles.\nA lot of Solana wallets are rotating into Remittix, a PayFi and DeFi project that targets real payments and smooth UX. It stands out for low gas fees, strong security reviews, and a fast-growing community. The presale is trending on X, Centralized exchanges are lined up, and the wallet Beta is live. For people asking what to buy early, RTX has become a top answer.\nWhy Remittix Stands Out\nThis mix is why many call RTX the best crypto presale of 2025, a high-growth crypto, and the best long-term crypto investment candidate. It checks the boxes for new altcoins to watch and upcoming crypto projects that aim to solve real-world problems.\nKeep an eye on Solana near $183 for the next reaction. A firm bounce keeps the Solana price prediction constructive at $186 to $188. In parallel, the Remittix presale continues to attract users who want the best DeFi projects of 2025 with low gas fee crypto design and real payment use. If you are hunting for the best crypto presale today, many Solana holders say Remittix is where they are placing their next ticket.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer:\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Users can now connect Solana-compatible wallets such as Phantom or Solflare and trade SPL tokens directly from the same interface that already supports Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Unichain.\nThis milestone eliminates a key barrier between two of DeFi\u2019s largest ecosystems. Previously, users had to leave Uniswap to interact with Solana DEXs like Jupiter or Raydium, now, everything is integrated under one roof.\nWhy Solana, Why Now\nSolana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has exploded in 2025, reaching $11.4B in total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama. The chain\u2019s speed, low fees, and growing NFT and payments sectors made it a natural fit for Uniswap\u2019s multichain roadmap.\nBy onboarding Solana, Uniswap taps into a user base that has grown increasingly active post-Firedancer updates and ecosystem funding waves. The timing also coincides with Uniswap\u2019s broader strategy to position itself as the default interface for all on-chain activity, regardless of network origin.\nHow It Works\nSwaps on Solana within Uniswap are powered by the Jupiter API, Solana\u2019s leading liquidity aggregator. This integration provides direct access to more than 1 million tokens, giving users deep liquidity and competitive rates without ever leaving the app.\nTo start, users simply connect their Solana wallet \u2192 select \u201cSolana\u201d in the network dropdown \u2192 and swap as usual. The experience mirrors Ethereum-based trading but leverages Solana\u2019s speed and low gas fees.\nThis release is Phase 1 of Uniswap\u2019s Solana support, with upcoming additions including bridging, cross-chain swaps, and Uniswap Wallet integration for seamless multichain portfolio management.\nMore News: Tether Donates $250,000 to OpenSats to Strengthen Bitcoin\u2019s Open-Source Ecosystem\nStrategic Implications for DeFi\nThis expansion is more than a new network launch, it\u2019s a statement on where DeFi is heading. By unifying Ethereum and Solana within one interface, Uniswap is addressing one of crypto\u2019s longest-standing pain points: ecosystem fragmentation.\nFor developers and liquidity providers, this move opens the door to cross-ecosystem arbitrage and unified liquidity routing, while for users, it brings simplicity and accessibility.\nUniswap\u2019s integration with Solana marks a turning point where DeFi platforms are evolving from isolated ecosystems into truly cross-chain financial networks, putting Uniswap one step closer to becoming the \u201cinterface of everything on-chain.\u201d\nFor more information on stablecoin adoption and blockchain innovation globally, keep checking Castlecrypto News."

When you see its price go up or down, you\u2019re getting a snapshot of how those top businesses, and in some ways the whole UK economy, are doing.\nI\u2019m going to walk you through what this all means in simple terms. We\u2019ll look at why it\u2019s a big deal for your investments, check out the tools that can help you make smarter moves, and figure out how to keep track of it all without any of the usual stress.\nReady to finally make sense of UK stocks? Let\u2019s get started.\nKey Takeaways\n- The FintechZoom.com FTSE 100 Index tracks the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange, including giants like AstraZeneca, Shell, and HSBC. The index first launched in January 1984 with a starting value of 1,000 points.\n- FintechZoom provides real-time stock prices and news from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM London time, offering live charts, technical analysis tools like Bollinger Bands and RSI, and instant alerts.\n- The FTSE 100 has significant global reach, with around 70% of its company revenues coming from outside the UK.

You\u2019ll see huge, familiar names on this list, like the energy giant Shell, the banking leader HSBC, and the consumer goods company Unilever.\nIt was launched back in January 1984, starting at a baseline of 1,000 points, and it took over from an older index called the FT 30.

                "body": "Indices weekly outlook: DAX forecast | Oct 19, 2025\nThe week ahead is set to be a busy one for the earnings calendar, while the macro calendar is again set to be quieter with the ongoing US government shutdown delaying the release of data there. Elsewhere, UK CPI on Wednesday and Global PMIs on Friday should bring about a bit of volatility for European markets. Among the indices to watch is the German DAX index this week, with the release of a few major company results to set the tone, including SAP in mid-week. With the impact of the huge fiscal push that could reshape sentiment in Europe to come, we maintain a bullish DAX forecast following the recent volatility.\nThe DAX took a hit last week, along with global markets, although finished the week off its worst levels on Friday. Between renewed US-China trade tension, credit risk in US regional banks, and stretched equity valuations, there was plenty to worry about last week. Yet, as we\u2019ve seen time and again in 2025, all it takes is one optimistic headline \u2014 or even a single Trump post \u2014 to turn sentiment on its head. And that is what markets got on Friday when a Trump interview led investors to believe a deal with China to at least extend the trade war truce is forthcoming.\nDAX forecast: EU equities still have reasons to stay upbeat\nDespite weak data out of Germany, European stock market investors aren\u2019t without hope. France\u2019s recent political stability has helped calm nerves, sending the CAD sharply higher last week. What\u2019s more, falling oil prices are easing inflation pressures. Add to that the growing conviction that the Fed could deliver two rate cuts before year-end, and the downside for equities looks limited.\nBut perhaps the biggest stimulus is Germany\u2019s fiscal plans. Berlin\u2019s \u20ac500 billion infrastructure package \u2014 alongside another \u20ac500 billion for defence and green initiatives \u2014 could provide a long-term lift to the Eurozone economy. That kind of spending backdrop doesn\u2019t come around often, and it\u2019s tough to stay bearish when policymakers are clearly shifting towards growth.

                "body": "The week ahead is set to be a busy one for the earnings calendar, while the macro calendar is again set to be quieter with the ongoing US government shutdown delaying the release of data there. Elsewhere, UK CPI on Wednesday and Global PMIs on Friday should bring about a bit of volatility for European markets. Among the indices to watch is the German DAX index this week, with the release of a few major company results to set the tone, including SAP in mid-week. With the impact of the huge fiscal push that could reshape sentiment in Europe to come, we maintain a bullish DAX forecast following the recent volatility.\nThe DAX took a hit last week, along with global markets, although finished the week off its worst levels on Friday. Between renewed US-China trade tension, credit risk in US regional banks, and stretched equity valuations, there was plenty to worry about last week. Yet, as we\u2019ve seen time and again in 2025, all it takes is one optimistic headline \u2014 or even a single Trump post \u2014 to turn sentiment on its head. And that is what markets got on Friday when a Trump interview led investors to believe a deal with China to at least extend the trade war truce is forthcoming.\nDAX forecast: EU equities still have reasons to stay upbeat\nDespite weak data out of Germany, European stock market investors aren\u2019t without hope. France\u2019s recent political stability has helped calm nerves, sending the CAD sharply higher last week. What\u2019s more, falling oil prices are easing inflation pressures. Add to that the growing conviction that the Fed could deliver two rate cuts before year-end, and the downside for equities looks limited.\nBut perhaps the biggest stimulus is Germany\u2019s fiscal plans. Berlin\u2019s \u20ac500 billion infrastructure package \u2014 alongside another \u20ac500 billion for defence and green initiatives \u2014 could provide a long-term lift to the Eurozone economy. That kind of spending backdrop doesn\u2019t come around often, and it\u2019s tough to stay bearish when policymakers are clearly shifting towards growth. Granted, the tangible economic benefits may not fully materialize until 2026, but the psychological impact is already being felt. That\u2019s supportive for the DAX forecast, even if traders remain hesitant until they see results in hard data.

S&P futures gained 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.3%.\nHelping sentiment to start the week was a report from The Wall Street Journal that said President Donald Trump in recent weeks has exempted dozens of products from his reciprocal tariffs and also offered to exempt hundreds more, reflecting an increasingly shared sentiment among administration officials that the U.S. should lower duties from some goods that are not domestically produced.\nStocks are coming off a volatile trading week, ultimately closing higher despite flaring tensions between the U.S. and China, a sell-off sparked by regional bank losses and declines in a few high-flying artificial intelligence stocks. A strong start to the third-quarter earnings season appears to be lifting sentiment, alongside investors' anticipation of another quarter percentage point rate cut at the Federal Reserve's late October meeting.\nThe three major U.S. indexes edged higher on Friday after Trump appeared optimistic on a potential trade deal with China ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said Friday that he thinks \"things have de-escalated\" with China and that he will likely be meeting with counterpart Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in the coming week. These comments suggested to traders that Trump's threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports beginning Nov. 1 may not happen.\nThe Cboe S&P 500 Volatility Index had jumped to a high above 28 at one point on Friday before easing below 21 as stocks moved higher.\n\"In spite of [Friday's] modest rebound in U.S. equities, risk-assets are reflecting heightened geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 particularly regarding U.S./China relations,\" Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust, said in a note to clients. Nixon added that \"the dispute presents significant economic risks to both sides, so the stakes are high to reach some sort of a palatable compromise.\"\nInvestors last week also attempted to move past concerns of credit risks that had caused a broader rout on Thursday. The market panicked after Zions and Western Alliance disclosed issues tied to bad loans, leading shares of several financial heavyweights and regional banks to swing lower before they rebounded on Friday.\nSeparately, investors continue to monitor the U.S. government shutdown, which is entering its fourth week as top Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a dispute over federal health-care subsidies.\nThis week, several large companies are expected to report quarterly results. Netflix, Coca-Cola, Tesla and Intel are among the names on deck. The September consumer price index is also set for release on Friday and is expected to show inflation remains hot. Traders will be paying special attention to the report, given the ongoing data blackout caused by the shutdown.\n\"Investors seem non-plussed so far, but many economists are raising concerns that a prolonged shutdown may impact quarterly GDP growth,\" Nixon said. \"Most acknowledge, however, that this would represent a temporary slowdown that would likely be followed by a catch-up period.\""

Again.\nThe initiative to take the job of pulling over bad drivers away from cops is months behind schedule, frustrating reform advocates and some city leaders who argue that Los Angeles is missing an onramp toward the future of road safety.\nLocal officials first raised the prospect during the national reckoning on racial injustice that followed the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, but the plan has progressed in sluggish fits and starts since. Backers thought that they had scored an important victory with the release in May 2023 of a long-promised study mapping out how most enforcement could be done by unarmed civilian workers.\nLast year, the City Council requested follow-up reports from various city departments to figure out how to do that and gave a three-month deadline. But more than a year later, most of the promised feasibility studies have yet to materialize.\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset about the delay,\u201d said council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson, one of the proposal\u2019s early champions. \u201cGenerally speaking, when you try to do a big reform like this, at least some portion of the people who want to do the work are very motivated to change the status quo \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we have that here.\u201d\nHe said that there was blame to go around for the continued delays, but that he\u2019s encouraged by his conversations with officials from the involved departments that studies will be completed \u2014 a precursor to legislation that would allow for re-imagining traffic safety.\nTwo brothers injured in a crash caused by a speeding LAPD officer were recently awarded an $18-million legal settlement \u2014 one of many cases in recent years where taxpayers shelled out for dangerous driving by police.\nAt the same time, he said that he still saw a role for armed police in certain traffic situations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think we need to be pulling people over at all for vehicle violations, especially for those that don\u2019t pose any public safety risks,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cIf somebody\u2019s going 90 miles an hour down Crenshaw Boulevard, that person does need to be stopped immediately and they do need to be stopped by somebody with a gun.\u201d\nIn a unanimous vote in June 2024, the council directed city transportation staff and other departments to come back within 90 days with feasibility reports about the cost and logistics of numerous proposals, including creating unarmed civilian teams to respond to certain traffic issues and investigate accidents. Also under exploration were ideas to limit fines in poorer communities and end stops for minor infractions, such as expired tags or air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror.\nOf the dozen or so requests made by the council, only two reports by the city\u2019s transportation department have been completed so far, officials said.\nBoth of the studies \u2014 one assessing parking and traffic fines, and the other looking at how so-called \u201cself-enforcing infrastructure\u201d such as adding more speed bumps, roundabouts and other street modifications could help reduce speeding and unsafe driving \u2014 are \u201cpending\u201d before an ad hoc council committee focused on unarmed alternatives to police, according to an LADOT spokesman. The committee will need to approve the reports before they can be acted on by the full council, he said in a brief statement.\nChief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the council\u2019s top policy advisor, said she understands frustration over the delays.

He was one of six children of Buzz and Mary Pattison. Tom grew up in North St Paul Minnesota, at the time a relatively small town with a green field stretching behind the house, and woods across the street. It was an idyllic place, red-winged blackbirds and pheasants calling, and places to run and bike. He attended St Peter\u2019s grade school, Hill High School, and then North Saint Paul High School. He loved cars, and spent weekends at Norm\u2019s Filling Station working on cars, something that became a life-long joy. Ten years separated his older siblings, Mickey, Pat and Kit from his two brothers, Tim (older) and Michael (younger). They grew up a tight brotherly crew.\nAfter relocating from Minnesota to Massachusetts, he met and married his loving wife, Mary. They were blessed by three children, Emily, Thomas and Christopher, the lights of their lives. A very proud papa, Tom never wasted an opportunity to tell anyone who would listen how wonderful his children were. His enthusiasm was real, and came from a deep and abiding love.\nTom served his community as a paramedic for more than 40 years \u2014 a role that was more than just a job, but a calling. He saved countless lives, delivered 23 babies, and offered comfort and strength to people on their hardest days. His courage, quick wit, and compassion touched every patient, partner, and family he encountered.\nOutside of work, he enjoyed tinkering in the garage and spending time with his six grandchildren. He loved spending time at all of their sporting events, taking them for rides on his tractor and letting them \u201cbraid his beard.\u201d He will be remembered for his quirky sense of humor and his passion in discovering new hobbies.\nTom is survived by his wife Mary Pattison, his daughter Emily and her husband Mike Tonucci of Burlington, CT, his son Tommy and his wife Maureen of Lunenburg, Massachusetts, and his son Chris and his wife Danielle of Hudson, Massachusetts. He is also survived by his six grandchildren Aubrey, Dakota, Taylor, Harper, Ella, and Phoenix. He also leaves behind his brothers Pat, Tim and Michael and his sisters Mickey and Kitty.\nHe was preceded in death by his parents Mary and Harry Pattison, his father-in-law Bob Weithman, and his grandson Ezra Pattison.\nA public memorial service will be held on November 1, 2025, from 11:00-3:00 at the Hudson Elks Club at 91 Park St in Hudson, MA.\nThe family would like to thank the Hudson Police and Fire Departments and Pride Star Ambulance\u2019s first responders for their care and support.\nHudson Elks Club\nVisits: 1687\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"

The broader Topix index was up 63.65 points, or 2.01 percent, at 3,234.09.\nThe U.S. dollar briefly rose to the lower 151 yen range as the yen was sold on growing concern over the deterioration of Japan's fiscal health with Takaichi, a proponent of fiscal expansion, likely to be elected prime minister on Tuesday.\nAt noon, the dollar fetched 150.85-89 yen compared with 150.54-64 yen in New York and 149.69-72 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Friday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1665-1667 and 175.97-176.04 yen against $1.1648-1658 and 175.47-57 yen in New York and $1.1712-1713 and 175.34-38 yen in Tokyo late Friday afternoon.\nThe stock market reacted positively to the perceived political certainty stemming from Takaichi's likely election as prime minister, expected at a parliamentary vote following the signing of a coalition deal between the LDP and a major opposition party anticipated later Monday.\nStocks jumped after losing ground last week on speculation the Komeito party's decision to end its coalition with the LDP could prevent Takaichi, who became LDP president on Oct. 4, from becoming Japan's premier.\nInvestor sentiment was also lifted due to receding concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump told a TV interview aired Friday that 100 percent additional tariffs on China he threatened to impose from November are \"not sustainable.\""

Investors are buzzing, betting the alliance\u2014known for favoring economic stimulus and holding off on rate hikes\u2014will keep Japanese stocks buoyant, even as the yen slides. The Nikkei\u2019s surge echoed across Asian markets, despite mixed signals out of China: while GDP and industrial numbers beat expectations, consumer spending and housing remained sluggish. China\u2019s leaders are meeting this week to plot their next Five-Year Plan and discuss trade, but investors aren't banking on blockbuster stimulus. Meanwhile, in the US, steady core inflation won\u2019t likely change the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to cut rates soon, but upcoming earnings from Tesla, Ford, and Netflix could steer near-term market moves.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Political tailwinds lift market confidence.\nJapan\u2019s stock rally has picked up steam as investors welcome the coalition\u2019s pro-growth policies, which could fuel profits\u2014even if the yen stays weaker. In the US, Bank of America is forecasting strong earnings for the S&P 500, especially among tech companies riding the AI wave. Across Asia, upbeat Chinese industrial output is helping offset cautious consumer spending, keeping the region firmly in growth-watch territory.\nThe bigger picture: Policy shifts reshape the global outlook.\nJapan\u2019s new government mix could shake up both leadership and the economy, with China showing it\u2019s holding steady on trade and growth despite global headwinds. Elsewhere, US political drama and inflation risks continue, while European central banks and fresh German data will provide more clues for anyone tracking the pace of global recovery.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
