At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading near $3,735, easing from an intraday high of $3,779, as traders weigh the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) cautious stance on the path of monetary policy easing.\nA rebound in the US Dollar (USD) and rising Treasury yields are capping upside attempts in Gold, though market bets remain firm on the prospect of additional interest rate cuts before year-end following last week\u2019s 25-basis-point (bps) reduction. Persistent geopolitical tensions and the broader fundamental and technical outlook continue to cushion downside risks, keeping dip-buyers engaged even as momentum stalls near record territory.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking in Washington on Tuesday, stuck to his familiar script, stressing that monetary policy remains \"data-dependent\u201d and that \u201cthere is no preset path\u201d for future interest rate decisions. He acknowledged that the balance of risks has shifted, with downside threats to employment rising, but cautioned that easing too aggressively could leave \u201cthe inflation job unfinished.\u201d\nLooking ahead, the Fed\u2019s dual mandate presents a delicate balancing act, though the tilt is increasingly toward safeguarding the labor market. Progress toward the 2% inflation goal appears to be stalling, but upside risks to prices are not materializing yet. With policy still firmly in restrictive territory, keeping rates elevated for too long risks inflicting unnecessary damage on employment, suggesting the Fed\u2019s bias should lean dovish even as it moves cautiously.\nMarket movers: Fed caution lifts Dollar, US government shutdown fears grow\n- Fed commentary on Tuesday offered mixed signals beyond Powell\u2019s remarks. Vice Chair Michelle Bowman struck a dovish tone, warning the Fed risks being \u201cbehind the curve\u201d on supporting jobs if it does not cut more decisively. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said there is \u201croom to cut rates\u201d if inflation continues to ease, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic cautioned that inflation risks remain present in the economy, citing persistent cost pressure in business plans.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, edges higher on Wednesday, snapping a two-day losing streak and rising nearly 0.65% to trade around 97.87.\n- Geopolitical tensions remain elevated. Russian MiG-31 aircraft entered Estonian airspace on Tuesday, prompting NATO to deploy fighter jets and Tallinn to call for Article 4 consultations. Additionally, Ukraine stepped up drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.\n- US President Donald Trump, addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, said Ukraine \u201ccan win back all the territory\u201d lost to Russia with support from NATO and Europe. He urged alliance members to \u201cshoot down Russian aircraft\u201d if they violated their airspace. Trump also criticized European nations for continuing to purchase Russian energy, calling it \u201cembarrassing\u201d that NATO countries were indirectly funding Moscow\u2019s war effort.\n- The US faces a potential government shutdown from October 1 if Congress fails to pass new funding legislation. Lawmakers remain deadlocked after the Senate rejected a House-passed stopgap bill that excluded Democratic priorities such as healthcare subsidies, while President Trump on Tuesday canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders, accusing them of making \u201cunserious and ridiculous demands.\u201d\n- Wednesday\u2019s US economic calendar is light with only tier 2 data in the form of New Home Sales, while San Fra"

                "body": "Investors who want to capitalize on the gold rally are increasingly opting for gold miners ETFs, which provide exposure to gold mining stocks rather than the bullion, often amplifying gains and losses. Some of the most important options available in the market are:\nVanEck Gold Miners ETF GDX \u2013 The largest and most liquid, with one-month average volume of 19.69 million shares and $21.44 billion in assets. Tracks a broad portfolio of leading gold mining companies. Prices of this fund have appreciated 105% year-to-date (YTD).\nSprott Gold Miners ETF SGDM \u2013 Suitable for momentum investors, SGDM reached a 52-week high on Monday. It tracks the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, targeting large-cap gold miners on Canadian and US exchanges. The fund is up 105% YTD.\nVanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ \u2013 Targets smaller, higher-risk gold mining firms, providing the possibility of higher returns. The fund has gained almost 108% this year so far.\nSprott Junior Gold Miners ETF SGDJ \u2013 An inexpensive option with a 0.50% yearly fee, focusing on smaller miners with potential for growth. The fund is up 94% YTD.\nThe ETFs have proven popular in a context of macroeconomic uncertainty, increasing gold prices, and global central banks adding gold to their reserves. Gold has risen around 10% over the last month and 42% year-to-date, boosted by safe-haven buying, Fed cuts, and the declining U.S. dollar.\nAlso, U.S. gold reserves have fallen to their lowest level in 90 years, contrasting sharply with the rest of the world's central banks, which are amassing gold at levels not seen in nearly half a century. At one time, the U.S. held over 50% of the world's reserves; today, that share is just 20%, while global gold holdings outside the U.S. have reached a 49-year high. Macro strategist Otavio Costa of Crescat Capital observes that this divergence could potentially lead to U.S. policymakers reconsidering their position.\nContinued expectations of Fed rate reductions also bolster gold\u2019s rally. As per the CME FedWatch tool, there\u2019s a 94.1% chance of a reduction in October and a 75.2% chance in December. Reductions in interest rates weaken the U.S. dollar, making gold a favorite among foreign investors. The U.S. Dollar Index has declined around 10% year-to-date, enhancing gold\u2019s appeal.\nFor investors seeking to hedge against market volatility while potentially profiting from gold\u2019s upward trajectory, the miners ETFs offer a strategic entry point. GDX and SGDM offer liquidity and potential growth, whereas GDXJ and SGDJ provide a higher-risk, higher-reward investment opportunity in junior miners. As long as gold fundamentals remain strong and macro risks continue to build, these ETFs could continue to attract investor eyeballs well into 2026.\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

                "body": "Market analysis by Quoc Dat Tong, Senior Financial Markets Strategist at Exness.\nWhen tensions in the Middle East began to escalate earlier this year, markets braced for the familiar chain reaction: fears of disrupted supply, speculative spikes in crude prices, and renewed volatility across global assets. In oil, these shifts are amplified. A targeted attack on infrastructure, a diplomatic breakdown, or a sudden production cut by an OPEC member can trigger price movements that ripple from regional economies to the world\u2019s largest financial centres.\nToday, those ripples are colliding with other fault lines, creating one of the most complex oil market environments seen in years. Understanding this landscape means understanding not just OPEC\u2019s influence, but the geopolitical forces shaping its every move.\nIn oil markets, a \u201cshock\u201d is less about surprise and more about scale. It\u2019s an event sudden enough to jolt supply, demand, or both. Wars, sanctions, unrest, and infrastructure attacks can choke supply almost overnight. On the other side of the equation, shifts in economic policy, trade restrictions, or even sudden surges in industrial activity can upend demand patterns just as quickly.\nIn practice, these shocks rarely happen in isolation. A supply cut triggered by conflict can also spark speculative buying, amplifying price swings. This is why understanding the source, whether it\u2019s a pipeline sabotage, a tariff dispute, or a regional conflict, is crucial for anyone trying to navigate oil\u2019s notoriously sensitive price dynamics.\nThe last few years have shown just how quickly a single geopolitical event can redraw the oil map. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is a prime example. Prior to the war, the EU sourced a quarter of its crude oil and 40% of its diesel from Russia. Within months, sanctions and outright bans from the US and EU cut those flows almost entirely.\nIn response, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released 60 million barrels from strategic reserves to ease prices. But the real shift was structural. Gulf states increased imports of discounted Russian crude, rerouting refined products back to Europe. Prices briefly spiked above 110 USD per barrel before settling into a lower range as new trade patterns took hold.\nThree years on, the EU has replaced much of its Russian fossil fuel imports with alternative suppliers and, crucially, ramped up renewable energy. Green energy\u2019s share of EU production has more than doubled since 2021, and if that trajectory continues, it could further soften oil demand and prices in the years ahead.\nWhen tensions flare in the Middle East, oil markets react. Prices shift on mere whispers of supply disruption, shipping routes are reassessed, and traders weigh the likelihood of escalation. In a commodity as globally integrated as oil, even localized conflict can send ripples across the globe, reshaping trade flows and market sentiment in real time.\nRecent flare-ups involving Israel, Iran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia have done just that, heightening supply fears. These developments come on top of unrest in Libya and Venezuela, all oil-producing countries, compounding uncertainty in a market already sensitive to political risk.\nThe organization\u2019s ability to stabilize prices for members adhering to agreed production quotas. But compliance isn\u2019t always guaranteed. Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia have all been frequent overproducers, sometimes driven by economic necessity or political pressure. Even Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has exceeded agreed limits.\nManaging this balance is even more complex when members are under sanctions or engaged in conflict. Russia\u2019s current status\u2014under heavy Western sanctions but also the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer\u2014complicates OPEC\u2019s decision-making. The group must avoid alienating Western buyers while also protecting its members\u2019 economic interests.\nAdding to the challenge, major oil producers outside OPEC+, such as the US, Canada, a"

The pair holds ground ahead of the German GfK Consumer Confidence Survey due later in the day.\nThe Euro (EUR) faced challenges against its peers following the disappointing headline German IFO Business Climate Index released on Wednesday, which unexpectedly fell to 87.7 in September from 89.0 in August. The data undermined the market expectations of 89.3.\nHowever, the EUR/USD pair maintains its position as the US Dollar (USD) struggles ahead of the Fedspeak later in the day. Focus will shift toward Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, due later on Friday.\nThe US Dollar (USD) appreciated as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious note, stressing that the US central bank must weigh stubborn inflation against a softening job market, calling it \u201ca challenging situation\u201d and reiterating comments from last week. However, the CME FedWatch tool suggests that money markets are currently pricing in nearly a 92% possibility of a Fed rate cut in October, up from 87% a week earlier.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Wednesday that further rate reductions are likely to be needed, as the central bank works to restore price stability and provide necessary support to the labor market. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee broke away from the overarching narrative of consecutive Fed rate cuts heading through the end of the year, widening the narrative gap between Fed incumbents and Donald Trump's newly minted Fed pick, Stephen Miran.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directl"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast: Euro to USD Slips to 1.1750 as German IFO Weakens and Fed Signals Policy Caution\nThe euro retreats on soft German sentiment and cautious Fed messaging, with traders eyeing 1.1730 support and 1.1820 resistance ahead of critical US PCE inflation data | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Slides to 1.1750 as German Data Disappoints and Fed Division Strengthens the Dollar\nThe EUR/USD pair is under heavy pressure, trading in the mid-1.1700s after failing to hold the 1.1820 ceiling earlier this week. The selloff was triggered by a sharp decline in Germany\u2019s IFO Business Climate index, which fell to 87.7 in September from 89.0 in August, undershooting expectations of 89.3. Both the current assessment and forward-looking expectations deteriorated, reflecting deepening concern inside Europe\u2019s largest economy. Weak manufacturing readings reinforced the drag, with German PMI sliding to 48.5 and France\u2019s manufacturing index tumbling to 48.1, a three-month low.\nFed Voices Split While the Dollar Gains\nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. dollar regained strength as the Federal Reserve\u2019s messaging remained cautious. Chair Jerome Powell warned that aggressive rate cuts are not guaranteed, even as markets still price in up to two more reductions before year-end. He highlighted the \u201cchallenging balance\u201d between curbing inflation and supporting a labor market already showing cracks. Meanwhile, new Trump-appointed governor Stephen Miran pushed for bolder easing, even suggesting a 200-basis point cut, while Michelle Bowman argued employment should take priority over inflation. Despite the noise, the dollar index surged above 97.30, helping drive EUR/USD lower.\nEurozone Data Contrast: Services Resilient, Manufacturing in Decline\nThe broader eurozone PMI showed a stark divergence. Services activity surprised with an uptick to 51.4, above the expected 50.5, while manufacturing dropped to 49.5, undershooting the 50 expansion threshold. France\u2019s service sector remained in contraction, with the index at 48.9, while Germany\u2019s service sector outperformed at 52.5, pointing to a growing reliance on services as factories struggle. This split underlines why the European Central Bank has been reluctant to commit to additional cuts after leaving rates unchanged in September, keeping policy divergence with the Fed alive.\nU.S. PMI Confirms Slowdown but Still Expansionary\nPreliminary September PMI data out of the U.S. confirmed cooling momentum but not outright weakness. Services slipped to 53.9 from 54.5, and manufacturing eased to 52.0 from 53.0, both in line with consensus. The composite index printed at 53.6, still comfortably above the 50 expansion threshold. Rising input costs combined with slower output price growth highlighted margin compression, but resilience in the data gave the Fed cover to resist aggressive easing for now.\nTechnical Picture for EUR/USD Signals Further Downside\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD breached the 1.1780 support, exposing the key trendline around 1.1740. The RSI has fallen below 50, confirming weakening momentum, while the MACD crossed beneath the signal line, reinforcing bearish bias. A clean break below 1.1740 opens the path toward the September 22 low at 1.1730 and then the September 12 trough at 1.1700. On the upside, the 1.1820 cap remains the first barrier, followed by 1.1850 and 1.1878.\nRead More\n-\nAVUV ETF Forecast: Small-Cap Value ETF Holds $100.18 as Historic Spreads, Fed Policy, and Earnings Momentum Converge\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows - BTC-USD at $113,600 as $246M Inflows Reverse to $363M Outflows\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast: Futures Steady at $2.858 as LNG Growth, EU Storage, and Winter Outlook Collide\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast: Dollar-Yen at 148.78 as Fed Holds Cautious Tone and BoJ Faces Policy Divide\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nInvestor Positioning and Sentiment in EUR/USD\n"

The current assessment also declined to 85.7, down from 86.4.\nThe data followed PMI figures released yesterday, which showed that business activity in the eurozone rose to a 16-month high in September thanks to a stronger service sector.\nWith inflation in the region at the target 2% level and growth stagnant the ECB left rates unchanged for a second month in September and may not cut rates again this year. This divergence from the Fed is keeping the EUR/USD supported.\nThe market is still pricing in two more rate cuts from the Fed this year, even after Powell struck a more cautious tone in his speech.\nEUR/USD forecast -technical analysis\nEUR/USD broke out of its rising trendline resistance, rising to a peak of 1.1915 before easing back below 1.18. The price trades above the rising trendline but is struggling to retake 1.1830, the July high. Buyers need to break above this level to extend the bullish trend towards 1.1920.\nFailure to rise above 1.1830 could see the price fall lower, breaking below the near-term rising trendline support to test the 1.17 round number. Below here 1.1580 comes into play.\nUSD/JPY rises amid a firmer USD as Powell adopts a cautious tone to further cuts\n- Fed Powell reiterated the fine balance between jobs and inflation\n- Japanese PMIs weakened, BoJ minutes are up next\n- USD/JPY trades in a range, approaching 148\nThe USD/JPY is rising amid a weaker yen, following softer-than-expected PMI data and as the USD steadies after two days of losses. This is due to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adopting a cautious stance in his speech towards potential rate cuts.\nFed Chair Powell adopted a cautious stance on further monetary policy easing, emphasizing the delicate balance between jobs and inflation. His comments fell short of the markets' more dovish expectations after the sharp weakening in the US labour market; however, traders have retained bets for two more interest rate cuts this year in line with the Fed's dot plot at the meeting last week.\nToday's attention is on U.S. new home sales and a speech from Federal Reserve official Mary Daly. Tomorrow sees the release of US GDP data, initial jobless claims, and more Fed speakers, as well as the US core PCE on Friday, which could make for a busy end to the week for the US dollar.\nThe Japanese yen is falling after the manufacturing and service sector PMI was weaker than expected. The manufacturing PMI showed a deeper contraction of 48.4, down from 49.7, while the services PMI saw growth slow modestly to 53 in September, down from 53.1. The data adds to the uncertainty surrounding Bank of Japan rate hikes.\nTraders are also assessing candidates for the position of Japanese Prime Minister. One of the front-runners, Takaichi, also a fiscal and monetary dove, noted that higher rates could impact mortgage rates and corporate investment.\nBank of Japan meeting minutes are due later. The minutes are from the meeting where the BoJ left policy unchanged last week; however, a growing division among policy members has led to hawkish signals, prompting investors to speculate about whether the BoJ will hike rates next month.\nUSD/JPY forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nUSD/JPY trades within a holding pattern, capped by the 200 SMA on the upside and by 146.25 on the downside. This setup is for a breakout trade.\nBuyers will look to rise above the 200 SMA and horizontal resistance at 148.50 to extend gains towards 150, the round number.\nSellers w"

Sellers took control as the pair failed to hold above its 21-day SMA at 1.3521 and broke below the 50-day SMA at 1.3470. A firm U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) at 97.70 added pressure, lifting the greenback against all majors after Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged stretched equity valuations and maintained caution on monetary easing. Momentum indicators confirm bearish control: RSI slipped to 44, while the MACD shows widening red bars after a fresh bearish crossover. Immediate support rests at 1.3400, with the September swing low at 1.3333 next if pressure continues. Resistance is layered at 1.3525, 1.3550, and 1.3600.\nPolicy Divergence Between BoE and Fed Intensifies Pressure\nThe policy backdrop remains tilted against sterling. The Bank of England under Governor Andrew Bailey has turned dovish, while the Fed keeps the door open for restrictive policy, allowing the dollar to attract safe-haven inflows. UK PMIs added to the weakness, with September\u2019s composite cooling and reinforcing the risk that Britain\u2019s fragile economy could underperform. Powell\u2019s U.S. commentary further widened the gap: his statement that equities look \u201cfairly highly valued\u201d supported the case for a stronger dollar, underpinning downside momentum in GBP/USD. Unless UK data surprise to the upside, the policy divergence suggests further risk toward 1.34 or below.\nSterling\u2019s Technical Landscape Shows Sellers in Control\nThe technical picture leaves little doubt that momentum is bearish. Having broken below both short- and medium-term moving averages, GBP/USD is tracking toward 1.3400, where a break could accelerate losses into 1.3333. The 21-day SMA at 1.3521 is now a first upside test for any rebound, while 1.3600 stands as a critical pivot that bulls would need to reclaim to shift sentiment.

The pound lost 0.68% against USD, 0.60% versus AUD, and 0.36% against CAD, while barely holding against the euro with a marginal -0.01% move. The dollar outperformed across the board, posting 0.74% gains versus JPY and 0.66% against EUR. This broad greenback strength emphasizes that cable\u2019s weakness is not isolated but part of a wider dollar resurgence driven by Powell\u2019s tone and renewed market caution.\nMacro Headwinds and Inflation Dynamics\nBeyond technicals, macro headwinds weigh on sterling. Sticky UK inflation keeps the BoE trapped, unable to pivot aggressively to support growth, yet not tightening enough to defend the pound. Meanwhile, U.S. data shows resilience, with Powell signaling the Fed can afford patience while retaining a hawkish tilt. This combination leaves GBP/USD exposed to downside risk in the short term.

                "body": "- AUD/USD softens to around 0.6585 in Thursday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Fed\u2019s Powell highlighted the balance between jobs and inflation.\n- Traders reduce their bets on an RBA rate cut after hotter Australia CPI inflation data.\nThe AUD/USD pair loses ground to near 0.6585 during the early Asian session on Thursday. The cautious rate outlook of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell provides some support to the US Dollar (USD) against the Australian Dollar (AUD). The final reading of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter (Q2) will be released later on Thursday.\nFed\u2019s Powell struck a cautious tone on further easing on Tuesday, saying that the US central bank needs to continue balancing the competing risks of high inflation and a weak job market in coming policy decisions. His remarks lift the Greenback and create a headwind for the pair. Powell further stated that the interest rates are in a good place to deal with either threat, suggesting he sees no urgency to lower rates aggressively.\nOn Wednesday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that further rate reductions likely will be needed, as the central bank works to restore price stability and provide needed support to the labor market. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned against a series of rate cuts. Traders slightly pared back bets for a Fed rate cut by year-end to about 33%, according to LSEG data. Markets continue to expect no change to policy in the October meeting.\nOn the other hand, Australia\u2019s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose at the fastest annual pace in a year in August, suggesting some upside to inflation that prompted traders to pare back the bets of imminent policy easing. According to Reuters, prospects for a rate reduction at its November meeting faded to 50% from almost 70% before the data. This, in turn, could underpin the Aussie against the USD in the near term.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposi"

The pair gains despite the dollar\u2019s firm footing. The move came despite Fed Chair Powell\u2019s remarks, who reiterated that the inflation risk remains high and the Fed might not rush into further rate cuts.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about MT5 brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe US dollar index (DXY) gained above 97.00, reflecting a broader dollar resilience. Powell highlighted that the current interest rate range keeps the Fed well-positioned to respond to future developments, signaling flexibility but a reluctance to accelerate easing. Contrarily, Fed Governor Bowman argued for quicker rate cuts to cope with the softening labor market, revealing a divide within the FOMC.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar outperformed its peers as the Australian CPI data came in upbeat at 3% year-over-year (y/y), against the expected 2.9%. It marked the highest reading since July 2024, indicating sticky inflation and deterring the Reserve Bank of Australia from reducing rates at its next policy meeting.\nAccording to Barclays Bank, the AUD/USD is expected to break above the 0.64-0.66 range that has been in place for recent months. The bank cites higher commodity prices and a hawkish RBA as tailwinds, while the Fed looks to ease further.\nKey Events Ahead\n- RBA Policy Meeting (next week): The Market focuses on whether substantial CPI data delays expected rate cuts.\n- US Economic Data Releases (GDP, PCE inflation): Critical for Fed policy trajectory and USD strength.\n- November RBA Meeting: Markets still pricing in potential easing; inflation and labour market data will be decisive.\n- Fed Communication & November Meeting: Any signs of policy divergence between the Fed and RBA will be pivotal for AUD/USD direction.\nAUD/USD technical forecast: Corrective downside\nThe recent 2% pullback from the 17th September highs of 0.6700 to the 0.6570 area appears corrective, with a probability of posting another leg higher. The price stays above the confluence of 20- and 100-period MA on the 4-hour chart. However, the gains could be capped by a 50-period MA at 0.6630. The MAs signal consolidation as there\u2019s no clear short-term trend.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex signals telegram groups?

The AUD/USD trades at 0.6590, down 0.11%.\nOn Tuesday, Powell said that the policy path is difficult for the Fed, which must look at both goals of the dual mandate \u201cequally,\u201d pushing back against almost certain rate cuts coming in the subsequent meetings. Nevertheless, market participants seem confident that the US central bank will reduce rates twice towards the end of the year.\nPowell added that risks in the labor market had risen and that inflation remains somewhat elevated. He acknowledged that policy remains modestly restrictive, but \u201cwell positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\u201d\nData-wise, New Home Sales in August improved sharply, from 0.664 million to 0.8 million, a 20.5% increase exceeding forecasts of 0.65 million. Although the data was positive, the latest S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) prints in the services and manufacturing sector, indicating the economy is cooling.\nAhead, traders will eye the release of Jobless Claims, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures and the Fed\u2019s inflation gauge, the Core PCE Price Index for August.\nIn Australia inflation metrics witnessed the CPI climbing from 2.8% to 3.0% \u2014 the top end of the RBA's target range. Consequently, the chances for additional easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) remain slim, just at 8%. The RBA will meet next week on September 30, with markets participants expecting the bank to hold rates.\nThe technical picture suggests that the AUD/USD could test lower prices, despite hoovering around the 20-day SMA at 0.6593. Buyers need a daily close above 0.6600 so they could challenge daily highs of 0.6628 ahead of 0.6650. Conversely, a drop below the 20-day SMA clears the path to challenge weekly lows of 0.6574, before extending its losses to the 50-day SMA at 0.6538. the next support lies at the 100-day SMA a 0.6514.\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies this month.

The US Dollar (USD) strengthens to near its highest in three weeks against the Japanese Yen (JPY) due to a fresh round of risk aversion across the financial markets and a cautious tone from the US central bank.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone on further easing on Tuesday, supporting the Greenback. Powell said that the Fed needs to continue balancing the competing risks of high inflation and a weakening job market in its upcoming rate decisions. He added that the interest rates are in a good place to deal with either threat, suggesting he sees no urgency to lower rates aggressively.\nFinancial markets anticipate quarter-point rate cuts at the remaining two Fed meetings this year and another in the first quarter of 2026, in line with the Fed's guidance after last week's meeting.\nThe S&P Global flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell at the fastest pace in six months in September, which dragged the JPY lower. Additionally, concerns over political uncertainty in Japan ahead of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election scheduled for October 4 could prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to delay raising interest rates. This, in turn, might contribute to the JPY\u2019s downside.\nTraders will keep an eye on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Meeting Minutes and the final reading of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter (Q2), which is due later on Thursday. Any signs of weakness in the US economy could undermine the USD against the JPY in the near term.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast: Dollar-Yen at 148.78 as Fed Holds Cautious Tone and BoJ Faces Policy Divide\nThe yen weakens as U.S. dollar strength returns, Japan\u2019s factory activity contracts, and BoJ minutes reveal hawkish dissent, leaving USD/JPY trapped between 147.00 support and 150.00 resistance | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast: Pair Trades Near 148.80 as Fed Caution Meets BoJ Uncertainty\nDollar Strength Pushes USD/JPY Toward 149.00\nThe USD/JPY pair advanced to 148.78, its highest level since early September, gaining almost 0.80% intraday. The move was driven by renewed U.S. dollar strength following Jerome Powell\u2019s warning that \u201cthere is no risk-free path\u201d in balancing inflation and employment. His cautious stance limited expectations of aggressive rate cuts, reinforcing near-term support for the greenback. The broader dollar index (DXY) also climbed 0.65% to 97.52, giving USD/JPY enough momentum to test resistance levels near the 148.65\u2013150.00 corridor.\nJapanese PMIs Deepen Yen Weakness\nThe yen\u2019s weakness accelerated after Japanese data showed the Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.4, from 49.7 in August, well below forecasts of 50.2. The services sector remained in expansion, but only modestly, at 53.0 versus 53.1 previously. These figures highlight the challenge facing the Bank of Japan: while inflation edges closer to its 2% target, weak factory activity and uneven growth make aggressive rate hikes politically and economically difficult. Market attention now turns to the upcoming BoJ meeting minutes, which revealed a 7\u20132 vote with two members pushing for a 25 bps hike, showing deep policy divisions inside the board.\nFed-BoJ Divergence Creates Tense Standstill\nThe policy divergence remains the critical driver. The Federal Reserve is leaning toward two more cuts before the end of 2025, but Powell\u2019s remarks kept traders cautious. Meanwhile, the BoJ is under pressure as Governor Kazuo Ueda admitted inflation is \u201capproaching 2%,\u201d while risks from food prices and U.S. tariffs persist. This split between a Fed pivot and possible BoJ tightening should, in theory, weigh on USD/JPY, yet price action has resisted downside, signaling strong speculative positioning and carry trade demand above 145.00.\nKey Technical Levels for USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY faces stiff resistance in the 148.65\u2013150.00 zone, a band that capped rallies earlier this year and during July\u2019s failed breakout. A decisive close above 150.77 would shift sentiment firmly bullish. On the downside, support lies at 147.00, followed by 146.00 trendline support, and deeper at 145.00, where liquidity from prior lows rests. Technical momentum is consolidating with multiple weekly doji candles, indicating indecision before a likely sharp move. The 200-day moving average continues to cap rallies, maintaining a medium-term bearish tilt unless broken convincingly.\nRead More\n-\nAVUV ETF Forecast: Small-Cap Value ETF Holds $100.18 as Historic Spreads, Fed Policy, and Earnings Momentum Converge\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows - BTC-USD at $113,600 as $246M Inflows Reverse to $363M Outflows\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast: Futures Steady at $2.858 as LNG Growth, EU Storage, and Winter Outlook Collide\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Pound to Dollar Slips to $1.3435 as Dollar Strengthens, 1.3400 Support in Focus\n24.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMarket Risks and Event Triggers\nUpcoming U.S. GDP revisions, durable goods data, and the Core PCE inflation index later this week are likely catalysts.

The current assessment also declined to 85.7, down from 86.4.\nThe data followed PMI figures released yesterday, which showed that business activity in the eurozone rose to a 16-month high in September thanks to a stronger service sector.\nWith inflation in the region at the target 2% level and growth stagnant the ECB left rates unchanged for a second month in September and may not cut rates again this year.

This is due to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adopting a cautious stance in his speech towards potential rate cuts.\nFed Chair Powell adopted a cautious stance on further monetary policy easing, emphasizing the delicate balance between jobs and inflation. His comments fell short of the markets' more dovish expectations after the sharp weakening in the US labour market; however, traders have retained bets for two more interest rate cuts this year in line with the Fed's dot plot at the meeting last week.\nToday's attention is on U.S. new home sales and a speech from Federal Reserve official Mary Daly. Tomorrow sees the release of US GDP data, initial jobless claims, and more Fed speakers, as well as the US core PCE on Friday, which could make for a busy end to the week for the US dollar.\nThe Japanese yen is falling after the manufacturing and service sector PMI was weaker than expected. The manufacturing PMI showed a deeper contraction of 48.4, down from 49.7, while the services PMI saw growth slow modestly to 53 in September, down from 53.1. The data adds to the uncertainty surrounding Bank of Japan rate hikes.\nTraders are also assessing candidates for the position of Japanese Prime Minister. One of the front-runners, Takaichi, also a fiscal and monetary dove, noted that higher rates could impact mortgage rates and corporate investment.\nBank of Japan meeting minutes are due later.

Click here to register.\nUSD/CAD is at a fresh monthly high this morning and that extends the sequence following last week\u2019s hold of a higher-low on Fed and BoC day.\nWhile both central banks cut rates, the response in the USD so far has been strength as the Fed was slightly less dovish than what markets had priced in. Markets were looking for 50-75 bps in cuts next year and the Fed instead indicated that they\u2019re looking at 25 bps; so even though the bank cut rates and highlighted another 50 bps in cuts for this year, USD shorts have been squeezed with the US dollar pushing back up to an area of resistance at prior support.\nAs followed for most of Q3, USD/CAD remains one of the more attractive venues for USD-strength and that\u2019s something that can even be dialed back to last quarter, as USD/CAD was setting higher-lows even as DXY was setting fresh lows.\nUSD/CAD built an ascending triangle formation as those higher-lows went along with horizontal resistance at 1.3750 \u2013 and that formation gave way in late-July. It\u2019s what happened after that makes matters more interesting, however, as that prior resistance of 1.3750 became support with bulls holding successively higher-lows, even into last week\u2019s pullback around the Fed and BoC rate decisions.\nAs tracked in the webinar on the Tuesday before, the big test was whether buyers could hold a higher-low, illustrating a degree of bullish anticipation. And that\u2019s precisely what happened, with last Wednesday\u2019s low printing just one-tenth of one pip, aka a \u2018pipette\u2019 above the prior swing low. And as USD strength has come back in the aftermath of the Fed meeting, USD/CAD has shined with prices rallying up to resistance.\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/CAD Bigger Picture\nAt this point there\u2019s a few important USD markets testing key spots, such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD, not to mention USD/JPY. Whether the Dollar can continue to breakout will likely have something to do whether those majors markets can see greater forms of breakdowns or breakouts, but if we can see USD bulls continuing to push, USD/CAD remains situated in an attractive spot with the 1.4000 level lurking overhead as the next key zone of resistance potential.\nAbove that, it\u2019s the 1.4151-1.4178 zone of resistance-turned-support and that\u2019s also around the 50% mark of the earlier-year sell-off. If that comes into play at some point in Q4, that becomes a significant decision point for the pair.\nOn a shorter-term basis, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of that same major move remains of interest for possible support and that plots at 1.3638.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

The pair loses ground as the US Dollar (USD) corrects downwards after registering more than 0.5% gains in the previous session.\nTraders would likely observe the upcoming US Q2 Gross Domestic Product Annualized later in the day. Focus will shift toward Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, due later on Friday.\nThe US Dollar gained ground as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious note, stressing that the US central bank must weigh stubborn inflation against a softening job market, calling it \u201ca challenging situation\u201d and reiterating comments from last week. However, the CME FedWatch tool suggests that money markets are currently pricing in nearly a 92% possibility of a Fed rate cut in October, up from 87% a week earlier.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Wednesday that further rate reductions are likely to be needed, as the central bank works to restore price stability and provide necessary support to the labor market. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee broke away from the overarching narrative of consecutive Fed rate cuts heading through the end of the year, widening the narrative gap between Fed incumbents and Donald Trump's newly minted Fed pick, Stephen Miran.\nBank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem said Monday that Canada must pursue a \u201cmore independent course\u201d from the US, citing the Dollar\u2019s weakness and warning of systemic risks from shifting global trade and financial flows.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dol"

The pair ticks down as the Japanese Yen (JPY) trades higher, following the release of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Monetary Policy minutes of the July meeting released earlier in the day.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nLast week, the BoJ held interest rates steady at 0.5% and kept the door open for further monetary policy tightening.\nGoing forward, investors will focus on the Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September, which will be published on Friday. Tokyo CPI ex. Fresh Food is expected to have grown at an annual pace of 2.8%, faster than 2.5% in August.\nSigns of price pressures accelerating would prompt speculation for an interest rate hike by the BoJ in the near term.\nMeanwhile, the Pound Sterling (GBP) trades broadly calm as investors look for fresh cues about whether the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates further this year. According to Reuters, the BoE will hold borrowing rates steady in the remainder of the year.\nOn Wednesday, BoE Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Megan Greene stated that the central bank needs to exercise caution on interest rate cuts as \u201crisks to our inflation outlook have shifted to the upside\u201d, Reuters reported.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

At the time of writing, the cross-pair trades at 200.16 after hitting a daily low of 199.46.\nGBP/JPY Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nTechnically, the GBP/JPY is poised to test higher prices. After clearing the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 199.67, the cross is set to end the day above 200.00, which paves the way for further upside.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is bullish, an indication that buyers are gathering steam.\nTherefore, if GBP/JPY rises above 200.50, the next area of interest would be 201.00, ahead of the yearly high of 201.27. On further strength, the next ceiling level would be 202.00. Conversely, if the cross-pair retreats below 200.00, the first support would be the 20-day SMA at 199.67. A breach of the latter will expose the 50-day SMA at 198.97, ahead of the 100-day SMA at 197.49.\nGBP/JPY Price Chart \u2013 Daily\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

At the time of writing, the cross is hovering around 200.00, holding onto recent gains but struggling to extend the advance.\nBank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey struck a dovish note on Tuesday, limiting Sterling\u2019s recovery. Speaking in the West Midlands, Bailey said that interest rates still have \u201csome further journey downward,\u201d but the pace of easing will depend on the trajectory of inflation, which the central bank expects to fall further next year. He acknowledged signs of softening in the labor market and noted that monetary policy remains restrictive at present.\nOn the Japanese side, the latest Jibun Bank flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data offered mixed signals. The Manufacturing PMI slipped deeper into contraction at 48.4 in September, down from 49.7 in August and below the 50.2 forecast, highlighting persistent weakness in factory activity and export demand. However, the Services PMI held firm at 53, only slightly lower than 53.1 in August, keeping the composite index in expansion territory at 51.1.\nAccording to Jingyi Pan, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, \u201cJapan\u2019s private sector business activity expanded at the slowest pace in four months in September, according to the flash PMI. Selling price inflation increased at a more pronounced pace, pointing to higher consumer price inflation in the coming months.\u201d Pan added that the survey highlights a dilemma for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), with weakening growth momentum on one hand and rising price pressures on the other.\nLooking ahead, attention will turn to upcoming central bank cues and key data releases. BoE policymaker Megan Greene is scheduled to speak later on Wednesday. In Japan, the BoJ\u2019s Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes are due on Thursday, followed by Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures on Friday.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoJ Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes\nThe Bank of Japan publishes a study of economic movements in Japan after the actual meeting. These meetings are held to review economic developments inside and outside of Japan and indicate a sign of new fiscal policy. Any changes in this report tend to affect the JPY volatility. Generally speaking, if the BoJ minutes show a hawkish outlook, that is seen as positive (or bullish) for the JPY, while a dovish outlook is seen as negative (or bearish).\nRead more.Next release: Wed Sep 24, 2025 23:50\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: -\nSource: Bank of Japan\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "The SEC has officially approved the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF to operate under new generic listing standards, giving it the greenlight to add XRP, SOL, and XLM to its existing portfolio of BTC and ETH.\nThe ETF, listed as NASDAQ:NCIQ, made the change last Thursday after updating its trust structure to meet the new criteria. The revised setup, filed under Form 8-K on Wednesday, includes a \u201cThird Amended and Restated Trust Agreement\u201d signed by Hashdex Asset Management Ltd. and CSC Delaware Trust Company, replacing the previous second agreement.\nThe ETF, built in Delaware, is tagged as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The filing didn\u2019t show any changes to its fiscal year or include any new financial documents. The updated trust agreement was attached as an exhibit to the filing, confirming compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s current listing demands.\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s vote to adopt the updated listing standards last week, several asset managers have kicked into gear. These new rules let qualified crypto ETFs skip the case-by-case review process, something that used to drag on for months. Under the old rules, approval could take as long as 270 days. Now, with the new setup, products can be cleared in as little as 75 days.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,\u201d said Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group. He confirmed that asset managers are already lining up, ready to take advantage of the rule change. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting ready for a wave of launches,\u201d he said. That wave is expected to hit hard in Q4 2025, according to Jonathan Groth at DGIM Law, who called this period a likely \u201cboom time\u201d for crypto ETFs.\nThe rush began in July, when the SEC first proposed the changes. Since then, firms have scrambled to rewrite filings, address SEC feedback, and meet the updated standards. Sources familiar with the process say the final updates could be submitted by the end of the week.\n\u201cThese are the rules we had been anticipating,\u201d said Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise. Fusaro says most filings are nearing the end of the review phase and could hit the market shortly. Analysts expect ETFs tracking SOL and XRP to debut in early October.\nTo qualify for the new approval process, ETFs must meet at least one of three main requirements. One, the coin involved must trade on a regulated exchange, or have CFTC-regulated futures contracts that\u2019ve been active for at least six months. Two, another ETF must already hold that coin with 40% of its assets directly invested in it, not via swaps or options. If any of those conditions are met, the ETF skips the red tape.\nBut not every firm is ready to roll. \u201cNot all of our existing filings qualify,\u201d said Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck. \u201cThe next step is to talk to our lawyers to see which products can move forward and how rapidly will they get onto the market.\u201d\nThat said, Grayscale Investments didn\u2019t wait around. Less than 48 hours after the SEC\u2019s announcement, it converted its private fund into a public product: the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC.P). This new ETF holds BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and cardano. According to Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale, their quick launch reflects their push for \u201cpublic market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.\u201d\nThe bigger question now is whether investors will actually care about ETFs tied to lesser-known coins. \u201cThere will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of,\u201d DaCruz warned. Unlike BTC, which took years to build trust, some of these coins may get only weeks or months of investor education before hitting the market.\nIf you're reading this, you\u2019re already ahead.

BlackRock\u2019s ETHA ETF drew $363 million in one day, and Fidelity\u2019s FETH has amassed $2.86 billion since debut. Ethereum ETF assets now total $30.54 billion, roughly 5.5% of ETH\u2019s market cap, compared to Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 ~$60.6 billion. This is shifting institutional preference: Ethereum now commands 15% of spot trading volume via ETFs, up from just 3% at launch in November 2024.\nXRP Joins the Regulated Arena With XRPR ETF Launch\nThe ETF wave is not confined to BTC and ETH. XRP (XRP-USD) gained momentum after the Osprey XRPR ETF debuted on Sept. 18, drawing $37.7 million in first-day volume\u2014the strongest U.S. crypto ETF launch of 2025. Within 90 minutes, XRPR crossed $24 million traded, five times more than XRP futures ETFs ever managed. This institutional embrace positions XRP alongside BTC and ETH in the regulated ETF market, boosting its price back near $2.96 with speculative targets of $9.90\u2013$20 flagged by analysts.\nCrypto Wealth Explosion: $3.3 Trillion Market Cap and 145,000 Bitcoin Millionaires\nETF flows are directly tied to the broader crypto wealth boom. According to Henley\u2019s September 2025 report, global crypto millionaires rose 40% year-over-year to 241,700, with Bitcoin alone minting 145,100 millionaires, up 70%. Crypto centimillionaires now number 450 (+38% YoY) and billionaires hit 36 (+29% YoY). These figures correspond with ETF inflows: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs surged from $37.3B to $60.6B in assets year-to-date, while Ether ETFs quadrupled to $13.4B.\nFederal Reserve Policy Adds Fuel to ETF Dynamics\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cuts amplified volatility across crypto ETFs. While some investors rotated out of Bitcoin ETFs in short-term de-risking, others see looser liquidity as a reason to expand digital asset allocations. Analysts note that returning positive flows within days could drive BTC back above $113,500 resistance toward $120,000, while sustained outflows may retest support at $108,000. Institutional buyers are using ETFs as the primary vehicle for these macro-driven reallocations."

                "body": "The SEC has officially approved the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF to operate under new generic listing standards, giving it the greenlight to add XRP, SOL, and XLM to its existing portfolio of BTC and ETH.\nThe ETF, listed as NASDAQ:NCIQ, made the change last Thursday after updating its trust structure to meet the new criteria. The revised setup, filed under Form 8-K on Wednesday, includes a \u201cThird Amended and Restated Trust Agreement\u201d signed by Hashdex Asset Management Ltd. and CSC Delaware Trust Company, replacing the previous second agreement.\nThe ETF, built in Delaware, is tagged as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The filing didn\u2019t show any changes to its fiscal year or include any new financial documents. The updated trust agreement was attached as an exhibit to the filing, confirming compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s current listing demands.\nETF issuers prepare for October launch\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s vote to adopt the updated listing standards last week, several asset managers have kicked into gear. These new rules let qualified crypto ETFs skip the case-by-case review process, something that used to drag on for months. Under the old rules, approval could take as long as 270 days. Now, with the new setup, products can be cleared in as little as 75 days.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,\u201d said Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group. He confirmed that asset managers are already lining up, ready to take advantage of the rule change. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting ready for a wave of launches,\u201d he said. That wave is expected to hit hard in Q4 2025, according to Jonathan Groth at DGIM Law, who called this period a likely \u201cboom time\u201d for crypto ETFs.\nThe rush began in July, when the SEC first proposed the changes. Since then, firms have scrambled to rewrite filings, address SEC feedback, and meet the updated standards. Sources familiar with the process say the final updates could be submitted by the end of the week.\n\u201cThese are the rules we had been anticipating,\u201d said Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise. Fusaro says most filings are nearing the end of the review phase and could hit the market shortly. Analysts expect ETFs tracking SOL and XRP to debut in early October.\nNew SEC rules speed up crypto ETF approvals\nTo qualify for the new approval process, ETFs must meet at least one of three main requirements. One, the coin involved must trade on a regulated exchange, or have CFTC-regulated futures contracts that\u2019ve been active for at least six months. Two, another ETF must already hold that coin with 40% of its assets directly invested in it, not via swaps or options. If any of those conditions are met, the ETF skips the red tape.\nBut not every firm is ready to roll. \u201cNot all of our existing filings qualify,\u201d said Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck. \u201cThe next step is to talk to our lawyers to see which products can move forward and how rapidly will they get onto the market.\u201d\nThat said, Grayscale Investments didn\u2019t wait around. Less than 48 hours after the SEC\u2019s announcement, it converted its private fund into a public product: the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC.P). This new ETF holds BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and cardano. According to Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale, their quick launch reflects their push for \u201cpublic market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.\u201d\nThe bigger question now is whether investors will actually care about ETFs tied to lesser-known coins. \u201cThere will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of,\u201d DaCruz warned. Unlike BTC, which took years to build trust, some of these coins may get only weeks or months of investor education before hitting the market.\nKEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast"

                "body": "The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with a new wave of institutional interest, and all eyes are on the Ethereum price movements. Analysis shows that a surge in Ethereum ETF inflows has reached a staggering $556 million, a clear signal of growing confidence from major players. Experts forecast this momentum to propel the ETH price by 20%, potentially pushing it past the $5,000 mark.\nBut this isn\u2019t just a positive sign for Ethereum holders; it\u2019s a critical vote of confidence in the underlying technology and, by extension, the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The bullish sentiment surrounding ETH is now drawing attention to projects with real-world utility and a clear vision for the future of finance.\nOne that\u2019s particularly eye-catching is PayDax Protocol (PDP), a project that\u2019s depowering centralized banks and empowering the people with a novel model for lending, borrowing, and insuring loans.\nEventual Ethereum Price Rebound and Why It Matters\nThe anticipated rebound of the Ethereum price to $5,000 is not just a price milestone but also signifies a maturing market. Ethereum\u2019s status as a secure, decentralized settlement layer makes it the foundation upon which DeFi protocols are built.\nThis heightened trust encourages a greater flow of capital and users into the DeFi space, unlocking new levels of liquidity and innovation. For Ethereum, this represents a potential 20% rise for ETH as inflows jump by $556M. But more interestingly, new DeFi tokens like PDP are attracting short-term projections greater than 1,000% amid institutional interest.\nPayDax Protocol (PDP) is a novel project that\u2019s tackling one of modern finance\u2019s biggest challenges: lending. Unsurprisingly, its unique solutions have left investors flocking to the PDP presale, and for tangible reasons.\nPayDax Protocol (PDP): 2025\u2019s Most Promising DeFi Project\nPayDax Protocol\u2019s vision is to dismantle the old, credit-score-based system and replace it with one that recognizes a person\u2019s true financial value. It\u2019s a decentralized alternative to traditional banks, built on the principle of giving people access to liquidity using their own wealth as collateral, not on an institution\u2019s arbitrary judgment. For instance, a collector with a high-value piece of art or a rare watch can now have it authenticated by Sotheby\u2019s, tokenized on the blockchain as a Real-World Asset (RWA), and used as collateral for an instant stablecoin loan.\nThis revolutionary approach transforms static, illiquid wealth into dynamic, working capital. And this system is built for the mutual benefit of every participant. A lender can provide liquidity directly to a borrower and earn a significant return on their stablecoins, receiving as much as 15.2% APY. For example, a peer with $100,000 in idle stablecoins can lend it out and, instead of a traditional bank\u2019s meager return, earn over $15,000 in a year.\nFurthermore, PayDax is redefining insurance with its Redemption Pool, which allows users to act as decentralized underwriters for loans. By contributing to this pool, these P2P insurers earn a premium, with some receiving up to 20% APY for securing the network (a role once reserved for large, centralized corporations).\nCredibility Backed By Infrastructure\nPaydax Protocol (PDP) is backed by a robust technical and physical infrastructure that ensures security, compliance, and trust for all users. The platform\u2019s smart contracts are already audited by Assure DeFi to guarantee integrity. Furthermore, PayDax relies on the following network of institutional-grade service providers to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance.\n- Sotheby\u2019s & Christie\u2019s: Used for the professional authentication of high-value collectibles like luxury watches and art before they are tokenized on the platform.\n- Brinks: Provides secure, physical custody for valuable Real-World Assets like gold and precious metals that are collateralized on-chain.\n- Jumio: Handles professional KYC and identity checks to ensur"

                "body": "Shares in Solana treasury firm DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) jumped as high as 6% before retracing amid news the firm increased its share repurchase program from $1 million to $100 million.\nDFDV is now changing hands at $15.73, up nearly 4% on the day. It\u2019s now up more than 2,100% year-to-date, but down 12% in the last week of trading.\n\u201cUltimately, buybacks are a tool to grow Solana-per-share (SPS) long-term, so we will be regularly evaluating the usage of buybacks against our other opportunities to grow SPS long-term,\u201d DFDV COO and CIO Parker White told Decrypt.\n\u201cOur goal is to maximize SPS growth, so depending on the mNAV, we may deploy additional cash into share buybacks or SOL purchases,\u201d he added.\nOther publicly traded digital asset companies, like Ethereum treasury SharpLink Gaming, have signaled that use of their respective share repurchase programs will come when their net asset value\u2014or crypto holdings\u2014are more valuable than the firm\u2019s trading market cap, as well.\nThat\u2019s the current situation for DeFi Development Corp, which holds around $452 million worth of Solana in its treasury, but trades at just a $395 million market cap at its current trading price, giving it an mNAV\u2014or a ratio of market cap to crypto holdings\u2014below 1.\n\u201cWe wanted to have the flexibility to conduct buybacks if the mNAV falls deeply below 1 for a sustained period,\u201d said White of the firm\u2019s increased repurchase program.\nThe 5 Largest Publicly Traded Solana Treasury Firms\nThe AI-powered real estate software firm kicked off its Solana treasury plans in early April, shortly after changing its name from Janover to DeFi Development Corporation to reflect its commitment to a digital assets play.\nSince that time, the firm has been further entrenching itself within the Solana ecosystem. In May, it purchased a Solana validator business for $3.5 million worth of DFDV stock and cash. Since that time, it\u2019s partnered with popular Solana meme coin BONK, launched its own liquid staking token, and established a $5 billion equity line of credit (ELOC) to help fuel its future Solana purchases.\nThe firm now holds 2,095,748 SOL on its balance sheet, making it the second-largest publicly traded Solana treasury firm in the world.\nWhy Is Solana Falling Harder Than Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP This Week?\nSolana is down 1% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $215.61. The asset has underperformed its major peers over the last week, falling about 9% with analysts telling Decrypt that priced-in corporate purchases and deleveraging pressures are playing a role.\nThat underperformance has led to a shift in Myriad\u2019s Solana all-time high market, with predictors now split evenly at 50-50 about whether the token will create a new all-time high above $293.31 by the end of this year. That\u2019s a 12% decline from Monday\u2019s mark, when predictors were feeling bullish and gave odds of 62% for the new Solana all-time high in 2025.\n(Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)"

                "body": "Asian markets found support on Thursday after a weaker yen fueled risk appetite, with USD/JPY edging back from the 150 handle. The move lifted US stock futures and Asian equities as traders weighed US-Japan interest rate differentials.\nThe Nikkei gained 0.13% in morning trading, while USD/JPY eased 0.16% to 148.653, partially reversing the previous session\u2019s 0.85% surge.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s minutes from the July monetary policy meeting initially lifted demand for the yen. But, subsequent Japanese data challenged bets on an October rate hike, limiting their influence.\nA hawkish BoJ policy stance, combined with expectations of further Fed policy easing, could narrow the US-Japan rate differential in favor of the yen. A sharp drop in USD/JPY toward 140 may fuel a yen carry trade unwind, potentially triggering a sharp drop in US stock futures.\nUpcoming Japanese and US data could change the narrative, with the BoJ and the Fed sensitive to labor market and inflation data.\nUS stock futures advanced in morning trading on Thursday, September 25. The Dow Jones E-mini climbed 88 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 47 points, and the S&P 500 E-mini rose 12 points.\nUS stock futures fell for the second consecutive session on Wednesday, September 24, after Fed Chair Powell highlighted uncertainty about the inflation outlook.\nLater Thursday, the US labor market and finalized GDP numbers will face scrutiny. According to preliminary data, the US economy expanded 3.3% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.\nA sharp downward revision may revive stagflation fears and weigh on risk assets as the Fed grapples with elevated inflation. On the other hand, an upward revision could offer market relief, potentially lifting sentiment.\nHowever, labor market data could have a greater impact on risk appetite. Economists expect initial jobless claims to rise from 231k (week ending September 13) to 235k (week ending September 20).\nA modest increase or drop in claims could temper bets on an October Fed rate cut, dampening sentiment. Conversely, a jump in claims toward 250k may boost expectations of a further policy adjustment in October and demand for risk assets.\nThe Kobeissi Letter recently commented on US labor market indicators, stating:\n\u201cUS aggregate weekly hours worked has fallen -0.2% over the last 3 months, the largest decline since the 2020 pandemic. This indicator measures the total hours employees work in a week, reflecting overall labor market activity. A drop in hours often signals that companies are reducing work before cutting jobs, indicating that more layoffs may be coming. In previous cycles, such declines have frequently coincided with recessions.\u201d\nThe GDP and labor market data precede Friday\u2019s highly anticipated Personal Income and Outlays report. Economists forecast the Core PCE Price Index to rise 2.9% year-on-year in August, mirroring July\u2019s increase. A higher reading could delay the timing of a Fed rate cut and raise concerns about stagflation as economic momentum slows.\nDespite the second day of losses on Wednesday, September 24, US stock futures trade above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), reaffirming a short-term bullish bias.\nHowever, the near-term outlook hinges on FOMC member commentary, US economic data, and the BoJ\u2019s rate path. For traders, here are the key levels driving market trends.\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nTraders should continue to track Bank of Japan policy signals along with USD/JPY and Nikkei trends. Later in the session, US economic data and Fed chatter could also affect sentiment.\nMeanwhile, Friday\u2019s inflation data will be pivotal for US stock futures. A higher Core PCE Price Index could weigh on risk assets and reverse September\u2019s market gains. On the other hand, cooling inflation could extend the market rally. The Dow Jones E-mini is up 2.02% month-to-date, with the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini posting gains of 5.59% and 3.55%, respectively.\nThese key drivers could extend o"

                "body": "Major stock indexes ended lower for a second straight day Wednesday following a three-session streak of record closing highs. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.4%, and the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.3% lower.\nOn Tuesday, the Dow and S&P 500 had set fresh intraday records soon after the opening bell before retreating, with equities investors possibly unnerved that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said stocks were \"fairly highly valued\" in his first comments since the central bank last week cut interest rates for the first time this year.\nA day later, indexes were little changed until turning lower around midday, with the S&P 500 Materials sector the worst performer of the 11 industries tracked by the benchmark index, ending down 1.6%. Technology shares also underperformed the market overall, with the sector 0.5% lower.\nShares of tech giants Oracle (ORCL) and Nvidia (NVDA) ended lower for second consecutive session, falling 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Amazon (AMZN), the worst performer in the Dow yesterday, closed down 0.2% for its third straight decline. Micron Technology (MU), which had risen in after-hours trading Tuesday when the memory-chip maker posted record quarterly sales, closed down 2.8%.\nHowever, others in the tech sector performed far better. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firm Alibaba (BABA) soared 8% after it raised its budget for AI infrastructure and models, while Marvell Technology (MRVL) ended up more than 7% to lead the Nasdaq. Intel (INTC) advanced more than 6% as Bloomberg reported that the chipmaker had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake.\nA bright spot was the S&P 500 Energy Sector, which rose 1.3%. Among the top gainers were Xcel Energy (XEL), EQT (EQT), and Phillips 66 (PSX), up more than 6%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, advanced 2.2% to roughly $64.80 per barrel.\nLithium Americas (LAC) shares nearly doubled on a report the Trump administration is looking to take a stake in the company, which is partnering with General Motors (GM) on a Nevada lithium mine. GM shares advanced 2.3%.\nGold futures, which set another record high early Wednesday, pulled back almost 1.5% to trade at $3,765 an ounce as of 4 p.m. ET. The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, ticked up to 4.15% from 4.11% at Tuesday's close. Bitcoin was up 1.6% to around $113,500. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies and hit its lowest level since early 2022 one week ago, rose 0.6% to 97.87.\nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Wednesday\nDecliners\n- Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers.\n- Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their \"buy\" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish \"overweight\" rating.\nAdvancers\n- Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado.

Miners like Glencore and BHP are upping their zinc output at Peru\u2019s Antamina mine by 67% to help offset a 12% fall in copper, extending the mine\u2019s lifespan to hedge against commodity swings. In the energy sector, Malaysia\u2019s Petronas pledged to maintain stable supplies after a court win over Shell MDS, signaling ongoing strength in Asia\u2019s energy markets. UK regulator Ofgem\u2019s new rules will force energy suppliers to lower fixed charges by 2026, but the move may not substantially ease consumer bills. Meanwhile, British wage growth holds steady at 3%, but signals point to gentler pay hikes as firms keep an eye on costs. In commodities, oil is rising for a second day, gold remains near record highs, and copper is holding its ground, suggesting a cautious undertone across markets. Investors are also eyeing results from names like JD Sports, EnQuest, Saga, and Pinewood Technologies for further direction.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Steady nerves tested as growth stalls.\nUK stocks are feeling the pinch, with mixed earnings and sluggish economic signals making investors wary. The FTSE 100\u2019s recent slip mirrors a cautious mood across Europe, as markets digest tepid wage growth and muted commodity movements. With oil\u2019s rebound and gold\u2019s stability reflecting a tilt toward safer assets, the coming round of earnings will be pivotal for momentum.\nThe bigger picture: Sector shakeups reveal shifting priorities.\nPolicy tweaks, output reshuffles, and ongoing legal battles highlight how sector moves can ripple across economies. Ofgem\u2019s energy reforms and strategic shifts in mining hint at industries bracing for long-term change. Against a backdrop of flat wages and slow business activity, it\u2019s clear companies and regulators are positioning defensively to manage future uncertainty.\nYou read that right: you can win two return flights to London, a three-night stay at a hotel in the capital, and in-person tickets to our Modern Investor Summit.

The U.K.-based retailer maintained its full-year outlook but signaled ongoing caution about the trading backdrop.\nFerrari (NYSE:RACE) lifted its EBITDA margin to 26.6% in the first half of 2025, up 20 basis points from a year earlier, as productivity gains offset higher costs from investments in staff and digital capabilities.\nCrude helped by drop in U.S. inventories\nOil prices are higher on Wednesday as a fall in U.S. crude inventories diluted worries about a fall in demand in the world\u2019s largest economy.\nAt 11:50 ET, Brent futures rallied 2.1% to $69.05 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 2.2% to $64.80 a barrel.\nBoth benchmarks climbed by more than $1 a barrel on Tuesday as a deal to resume exports from Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan stalled, dampening worries about additional supply onto the global market.\nHelping the tone was the news that crude stocks declined by 3.82 million barrels in the week ended September 19, while gasoline inventories fell by 1.05 million barrels, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute figures.\nShould you invest $2,000 in JD right now?\nMost investors will find it hard to answer that question with total confidence. Short of a guarantee, which no one can give you, the most successful traders stick to proven best practices without letting hype or hyper-vigilance take over their better judgment.\nBut that doesn't mean you can't use smart shortcuts.

Powell\u2019s remarks introduced new concern that the Fed may hold off on further easing unless there is clearer evidence of slowing inflation or a softening labor market.\nLast week\u2019s rate cut helped fuel the September rally, but momentum is stalling. Powell\u2019s focus on asset pricing suggests the central bank is watching more than just employment and inflation prints. For traders, that raises the stakes heading into Friday\u2019s core PCE report\u2014one of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauges.\nPowell\u2019s acknowledgment of inflated asset prices raised concerns that the central bank may hesitate to ease policy further without clear economic justification. The market is now increasingly sensitive to incoming data, with many investors looking toward the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge\u2014core PCE\u2014due later this week.\nDespite policy uncertainty, some sectors outperformed. Energy stocks surged, with the S&P 500 energy sector gaining 2% as crude prices climbed. Consumer discretionary also saw modest gains, up 0.5%. However, tech weighed on the broader market. The S&P 500 tech sector dropped 0.7%, led by more than 1% losses in Apple and Nvidia.\nSurprisingly strong housing data added another twist. Sales of new single-family homes jumped 20.5% in August, raising questions about the urgency of further rate cuts. Analysts warned that signs of resilience in the housing market could complicate the Fed\u2019s calculus, limiting policy flexibility.\nAlibaba led Chinese ADRs higher with an 8.9% rally after announcing a partnership with Nvidia. Lithium Americas nearly doubled after news surfaced that the U.S. government was eyeing a stake and a $2.26 billion loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project. General Motors gained 1.4% following an upgrade from UBS and ties to the lithium project.\nIn contrast, Micron fell 4% after reporting quarterly results. Oracle dropped 3.5% amid reports of a $15 billion bond sale plan.

                "body": "Investing\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Sept 24)\nBy Joel South\nSep 24, 2025 | Updated 8:20 AM ET\nThis post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.\nShares of Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) are changing hands for 10.0% more than a week ago, outperforming the Nasdaq. The electric vehicle (EV) maker just broke ground on its new $5 billion manufacturing plant in Georgia and has begun upgrading its plant in Illinois. And there has been speculation that it may unveil an electric bike in the near future. The share price is 30.4% higher than a year ago.\nShares of EV manufacturer Rivian have been on a rollercoaster this year, surging and then falling after its first-quarter report. They have recovered somewhat since the second-quarter report. In the latest results, revenue was up slightly year over year and sequentially to $1.3 billion. However, the company also posted a wider-than-expected loss and widened its full-year loss projection due to tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. This reflected a 90% decline from its November 2021 IPO high. Some Wall Street analysts decreased their price targets after the report.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points:\n- The EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% through 2030, but Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) forecasts lower deliveries for 2025 than in 2024.\n- After reporting second-quarter earnings, the company has now posted consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, and its cash position remains solid.\n- Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don\u2019t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor)\nStill, the stock is 49.9% higher since its year-to-date low in April, despite facing challenges from reduced delivery targets and tariff pressures. However, it is countering those headwinds with cost efficiencies, strategic partnerships, and the anticipated R2 launch next year. 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis to give investors a better idea of where they can expect the stock to be in a year. Let\u2019s take a look at whether Rivian can overcome its hurdles and return to growth.\nWhy Invest in Rivian?\nRivian is grappling with significant obstacles. Second-quarter deliveries totaled 10,661 vehicles, down 22.7% year over year. This decline in deliveries comes as Rivian prepares for the launch of its 2026 model year vehicles. The company reaffirmed its 2025 delivery guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. It cited softening demand due to economic uncertainties and shifting consumer sentiment, as well as tariffs that are increasing manufacturing costs.\nRivian is still losing a lot of money on every car it builds, even though it was able to reduce the per-share vehicle losses from $43,000 in Q4 to $38,798 in Q1. Moreover, car buyers likely accelerated their purchases into the first quarter to avoid potential tariffs. As a result, sales for the current quarter could be weak as well.\nStill, a $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen, with $1 billion turned over in June 2025, bolsters Rivian\u2019s $7.2 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. The R2, a $45,000 midsize SUV set for 2026 production in Illinois, targets broader appeal, while plant upgrades\u2014including a planned month-long shutdown in the second half of 2025\u2014aim to boost efficiency by 30%.\nFurther, the EV market is expected to grow at a 32% CAGR through 2030, though Rivian projects full-year 2025 revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, which at the midpoint is down from $4.97 billion last year. The hope is that the new R2 release and fleet sales could boost revenue further.\nFor its part, Rivian has now seen consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. The EV make"

His wines have landed on the lists of top-end restaurants like Hatchet Hall, Vespertine, Meteora, Anajak Thai and Manuela, where they\u2019re often singled out with sidebars, subsections and narrative intros, declaring, in so many words, \u201cCheck this guy out!\u201d\nEven in a town like Los Angeles, where the rules for what is and what isn\u2019t cool to drink can be relentlessly, er, fluid, Sampler\u2019s wines have managed to channel L.A.\u2019s boundless culinary enthusiasms for the past decade. Pungent, savory, defiantly unfruity, his wines can be polarizing even in the era of natural wine, when wine\u2019s very range of flavors is in flux.\nAnd yet by their sheer force of personality, idiosyncrasy and restless energy, Sampler\u2019s wines are among the most popular and successful in L.A. right now and feel distinctly of and for this city. An Angeleno by birth, he\u2019s taken a highly developed artistic temperament and a penchant for philosophy and directed these into the medium of winemaking.\n\u201cHe goes deep,\u201d says Anajak Thai\u2019s wine director Ian Krupp, who\u2019s worked with Sampler\u2019s wines and has collaborated on restaurant-only exclusives. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have any boundaries for himself.\u201d\nSampler has three distinct wine brands. There\u2019s Scotty-Boy! (exclamation his), perhaps his most visible and accessible, with arcane names like \u201cBig Tang\u201d and \u201cEl Sandweech!!!\u201d They\u2019re often blends of grape varieties that really have no business being in the same bottle, like Chardonnay and Riesling, with varying levels of skin contact, co-fermentation, carbonic ferments or p\u00e9tillance.\nWines from the other two brands, CCGP (Central Coast Group Project) and L\u2019Arge d\u2019Oor (see what he did there?) might be construed as more serious, with long periods \u2014 as much as 12 years \u2014 in barrel and bottle before release.\nHave a family recipe for your favorite holiday cookie? The L.A. Times is accepting recipe submissions for its 2025 Holiday Cookie Bake-Off until Monday, Oct. 13.\nHis latest endeavor, Cahiers du Oenologique (\u201cwinegrowing notebooks\u201d), is a joint project with his high school friend, filmmaker Babak Shokrian. They\u2019ll release an estate wine in the fall from Shokrian\u2019s vineyard in Los Alamos, supplemented with art materials, short films, photos and a quarterly journal documenting the process as it went from harvest to bottle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be exploring the auteur theory of winemaking,\u201d says Sampler.\nTaken together, his wines flirt with the flavors associated with natural wines \u2014 sour, slightly grubby, jangly and volatile, flavors sometimes more common in kombucha than wine, ranging from serious to \u201cchuggy.\u201d\nThat range, and that vibe, attracts people to him, especially sommeliers, like Nathaniel Mu\u00f1oz, former wine director at the Rose Caf\u00e9 in Venice. \u201cScott chooses to approach winemaking,\u201d he says, \u201cin a way that challenges most people\u2019s thinking about what you can do to grapes that will become wine.\u201d\n\u2018I dove right in\u2019\nOn a recent Thursday, Sampler was ensconced in a booth across from the bar at Musso & Frank\u2019s in Hollywood. He likes to say that his first meal at Musso & Frank\u2019s was in utero. \u201cMy parents used to come here before I was born,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBy the time I was seven I was a regular.\u201d\nOver his Musso & Frank favorites \u2014 lightly grilled prime rib, sand dabs, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, apple pie \u00e0 la mode \u2014 he discussed how it all started.\n\u201cI had absolutely no thought of making wine until it started to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cThese abstract ideas I kept having around winemaking started to coalesce, they started to become a tangible thing.
