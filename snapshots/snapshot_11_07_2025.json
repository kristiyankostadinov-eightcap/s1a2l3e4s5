The mining stocks rallied earlier today, only to then decline in the following hours.\n2. The decline in the USD Index (the UUP ETF at the bottom part of the chart serves as a proxy for it) didn\u2019t cause a bigger rally in GLD or SLV.\nThe second point is a bearish short-term sign, but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, as gold and silver futures moved higher before the U.S. session started. USD\u2019s decline triggered gold\u2019s and silver\u2019s rallies and USD\u2019s comeback triggered moves lower in both metals.\nThis is important because it shows that the precious metals market is willing and likely to react to USD\u2019s further rallies with declines.\nThis, in turn, is important because the USD Index \u2013 trading close to 100 \u2013 is on the verge of a major breakout and launching a rally that will finally be clear for everyone.\nI\u2019ve been writing for months that when the USD rally becomes clear, the precious metals market is likely to slide, and it looks like this is about to take place.\nGDXJ Reversal Reveals Bearish Pressure\nThe intraday reversal in the GDXJ \u2013 proxy for junior mining stocks suggests that the bearish forces are strong and that there\u2019s a lot of nervousness among the investors right now. This suggests that the declines can be particularly volatile.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market. Investing.com's ProPicks AI includes dozens of winning stock portfolios chosen by our advanced AI.\nYear to date, 3 out of 4 global portfolios are beating their benchmark indexes, with 98% in the green.

                "source": "VT Markets",
                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/gold-dips-under-4000-losing-bullish-momentum-while-monitoring-federal-reserve-speakers-for-guidance/",
                "body": "Gold prices have dipped below $4,000 after failing to maintain upward momentum. The value stands at approximately $3,985, as the US government shutdown keeps markets volatile, impacting the US Dollar\u2019s strength. Investors are focusing on incoming statements from Federal Reserve officials for potential monetary policy adjustments.\nCentral Bank Activity And Market Impact\nDespite potential growth restraints, market conditions such as stronger-than-expected employment data and an improved ADP Employment Change report have tempered expectations of rate cuts this December. Central banks increased their gold holdings, with 39 tonnes purchased in September, led by Brazil\u2019s acquisition of 15 tonnes. Gold-backed ETF inflows were substantial during the third quarter, contributing to a 58% rise in US gold demand year-on-year.\nTechnical analysis presents resistance for gold prices in the $4,020-$4,050 range, with key support at $3,985, as traders navigate market conditions. The US Dollar Index has seen a retreat after a peak, influenced by the ongoing government shutdown and potential monetary policy changes. Global equity markets\u2019 firmness has also affected gold\u2019s near-term performance, with broader geopolitical and economic uncertainties maintaining overall positive prospects for the metal.\nWith gold currently hesitating around the $4,000 mark, we are in a period of consolidation. The market is caught between the supportive tailwind of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history and the headwind from strong recent economic data. This tension suggests volatility is coiled and preparing for a significant move in the coming weeks.\nGiven the uncertainty, traders should consider strategies that profit from a sharp price movement in either direction, such as a long straddle. Buying both call and put options with the same strike price and expiry allows a trader to capitalize on the breakout that could be triggered by the upcoming Fed commentary or news on the shutdown. This is especially relevant now, as the CBOE Gold Volatility Index (GVZ) has ticked up to 18.5, its highest level in two months, showing the market is beginning to price in a larger move.\nUpcoming Catalysts For Gold Movement\nThe upcoming October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, due next week, will be a critical catalyst for gold. A higher-than-expected inflation reading could force the Fed to maintain its restrictive stance, likely sending gold lower. Conversely, a soft CPI number would increase pressure for rate cuts, which would be highly bullish for gold and could spark a rally past recent highs.\nFor those with a bullish bias, buying call options with strikes above the $4,050 resistance level seems prudent. We have seen this pattern before, as persistent central bank buying provided a floor for prices during the extended market uncertainty of the 2018-2019 shutdown. The World Gold Council\u2019s latest data confirms this trend, with China and Brazil leading another 39 tonnes of net purchases in September 2025, reinforcing long-term support.\nConversely, a bearish outlook suggests purchasing put options, particularly if gold breaks below its immediate support at $3,985. The strong ADP and ISM figures, along with hawkish tones from Fed officials like Austan Goolsbee, point toward higher-for-longer interest rates. This environment increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold and could easily push the price back toward the established $3,900 floor.\nThe key technical levels from the charts provide clear targets for setting derivative strikes. A definitive break above the stubborn $4,050 resistance zone would signal a bullish continuation, making out-of-the-money calls attractive. Meanwhile, a sustained drop below the $3,985 moving average support would validate a bearish position, favoring puts targeting the $3,900 level."

Conducting a comprehensive literature review, a MILP model was developed to simulate a multifaceted refined oil supply chain, integrating refining and import facilities, storage depots, and customer demand nodes. The study unfolds in two phases: a deterministic model establishing a supply chain performance baseline, and a Monte Carlo simulation generating disruption scenarios. Results reveal increased transportation costs and significant flow modifications between entities. Imports of refined oil products surged to counter local production shortages, with increased use of cost-effective bulk cargo modes and a notable reliance on road transport to offset disrupted pipelines. The study highlights the substantial impact of disruptions on transportation costs, emphasizing diversified transportation methods where pipelines are constrained. Acknowledging study limitations focusing on a singular supply chain\u2019s transport costs, it advocates for research on inventory management and alternate pipeline development to enhance supply chain resilience under disruption scenarios.\nIntroduction\nToday, the oil industry operates one of the most advanced and intricate supply chains globally. As per the Energy Institute\u2019s report, the global energy consumption in 2022 soared to an impressive 52,969 TWh, solidifying oil\u2019s status as the most coveted commodity of the 21 st century. Operating as a quintessential supply chain, the petroleum industry seamlessly integrates supply facilities and manufacturing centers across the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments. Disruptions within this complex network can arise from various sources, encompassing technical failures, emergencies, supply issues, and natural calamities, ultimately impacting functions, as highlighted by Azad et al.1. Additionally, the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was keenly felt as it impeded the supply of crude oil to refineries, underscoring the critical need for diversified sourcing and robust contract management as vital mitigation strategies2. The aftermath of the Ukraine-Russia war has also resulted in the crude oil prices to become rise significantly that have impacted global energy supply chains3.\nThe downstream landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of refineries, distribution centers, transportation infrastructure, and diverse refined product demands, necessitating a strategic approach to network design. The distribution of goods between downstream facilities is separated into two categories: primary distribution and secondary distribution. The primary is responsible for distributing oil products across refineries, petrochemical plants, and depots in the wholesale segment. It originates in the refineries and ends at transshipment points. The principal distribution modes are pipeline (pipelines), marine (ships), railroad (train wagons), and road (tank trucks). The secondary transportation starts in storage depots and moves oil products from domestic, international, and regional petrochemical plants and refineries to the end consumers in the retail sector or exports them abroad. Tank trucks and occasionally railway wagons are the transportation methods that are most frequently utilized in secondary distribution. Strategic decisions encompass optimizing distribution center location, capacity, and interlinkages, while tactical considerations involve regulating product flows, managing inventory, and selecting appropriate transport modes. To ensure efficient and seamless operations, companies must strategically source refined products from multiple refineries and import terminals, aligning transportation quantities with facility capacities and demand nodes.\nWorldwide instability has resulted in disruptions becoming increasingly unpredictable as well as more frequent in all kinds of industries."

Firstly, sources indicate limited risk of a direct U.S. attack on Venezuela, though they do not rule out such action in the future. Secondly, Saudi Arabia lowered its oil export prices to Asia, while OPEC slightly increased production, raising concerns about a potential record oversupply in 2026. Earlier, President Donald Trump said his goal is to bring U.S. gasoline prices down to $2 per gallon.\nU.S. Rules Out Ground Attacks in Venezuela \u2014 For Now\nOfficials from the Trump administration informed Congress on Wednesday that the United States is not currently planning ground attacks in Venezuela and lacks legal justification for such operations, according to sources familiar with the briefing.\nThe meeting included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and a representative from the White House Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).\n- The Justice Department\u2019s legal opinion allowing strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels at sea does not cover attacks on land targets in Venezuela or other countries in the region.\n- However, the administration plans to request a new legal opinion that could permit limited military action without Congressional approval, though no final decision has been made.\n- Since September, the U.S. military has conducted 16 strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, resulting in at least 67 deaths.\n- These operations are based on intelligence linking the vessels to 24 Latin American cartels and criminal organizations.\n- Senator Mark Warner acknowledged the strength of U.S. intelligence capabilities but questioned the use of lethal force instead of interdiction procedures typically employed by the Coast Guard.\n- Other lawmakers, including Gregory Meeks, raised concerns about the legality of the operations and the lack of presented evidence directly linking the targets to drug trafficking.\n- Administration officials insist that every strike follows a thorough, multi-stage intelligence process and emphasize that the current U.S. military presence in the Caribbean, including the USS Ford carrier strike group, supports counter-narcotics and reconnaissance operations, not preparations for direct strikes on Venezuelan territory.\nThe U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote today on a War Powers Resolution aimed at blocking unauthorized military action in Venezuela. The proposal, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) and co-sponsored by 15 lawmakers from both parties, calls for ending the use of U.S. armed forces against Venezuela unless Congress formally authorizes military action or declares war.\nSaudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices to Asia to 11-Month Low\n- Saudi Aramco has lowered the December price of its flagship Arab Light crude for Asian buyers by $1.20 per barrel, setting it at a $1 premium to the regional benchmark \u2014 the lowest level in 11 months.\n- The cut follows the OPEC+ decision to pause planned production increases in the first quarter of 2026, reflecting caution amid signs of oversupply.\n- Saudi Arabia and other key producers have temporarily halted additional output hikes after a modest increase in December, citing weaker seasonal demand and the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports.\nAramco also reduced prices for Medium and Heavy grades by $1.40 per barrel, and for Super Light and Extra Light by $1.20 for Asian customers. Prices for North American buyers were cut by $0.50 per barrel, while European and Mediterranean prices remained unchanged.\nOPEC Output Rises Slightly in October\nAccording to a Bloomberg survey, OPEC increased crude production by 50,000 barrels per day in October, reaching 29.07 million barrels per day. Rising output from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait was partially offset by declines in Libya and Venezuela, which together reduced production by about 120,000 barrels per day.\n- The mo"

A brief stint below 1.15 into the start of the month has been erased with the weekly opening-range now set just below the October 9th swing low at 1.1542. Looking for a breakout in the days ahead for guidance here.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nNotes: A closer look at Euro price action shows EUR/USD continuing to trade within the confines of the descending pitchfork extending off the yearly high. A two-day rally is now testing confluent resistance near the 75% parallel at 1.1537/42- a region defined by the objective monthly / weekly open and the mid-October swing lows. A rally surpassing this pivot zone would expose a stretch towards the Fed reversal close at 1.1601. Note that this level converges on the upper parallel tomorrow (near-term bearish invalidation). Ultimately, a breach / close above the 38.2% retracement of the September decline and the September 25 swing low at 1.1641/46 would be needed to suggest a more significant low is in place / a larger reversal is underway. Subsequent resistance eyed at the October high-day close (HDC) / 61.8% retracement at 1.1731/47.\nInitial support rests at the 1.15-handle and is backed closely by the weekly range low at 1.1469. A break / close below the median-line is needed to mark resumption of the September downtrend with subsequent support objectives seen at the May HDC / August low at 1.1387/92 and 200-day moving average / 100% extension of the September decline at 1.1340/52. Both regions represent areas of interest for possible downside exhaustion / price exhaustion IF reached.\nBottom line: EUR/USD is threatening downside exhaustion here and the risk remains for a larger recovery within the multi-month downtrend. From a trading standpoint, the immediate focus is on a breakout of the weekly opening-range for guidance. Rallies should be limited to 1.16 IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below the weekly low needed to fuel the next leg of this decline.\nNote that economic data remains limited next week amid the ongoing government shutdown. Stay nimble into the November opening-range and watch the weekly closes here for guidance.

                "source": "VT Markets",
                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/a-softer-us-dollar-aids-eur-usd-in-climbing-above-1-1500-despite-eurozone-retail-sales-concerns/",
                "body": "The Euro has managed modest gains against the US Dollar, climbing above 1.1500, despite challenges in extending beyond 1.1525 due to weak Eurozone Retail Sales data. Retail Sales in the Eurozone fell 0.1% in September, contrary to the anticipated 0.2% increase, following a revised 0.1% decline in August.\nPositive US employment and services data limited bearish pressure on the US Dollar, leading to a brighter market outlook. The ADP Employment Report indicated 42,000 new jobs in October, surpassing expectations, while the US ISM Services PMI rose to 52.4 from 50.0, suggesting robust economic activity.\nFederal Reserve Rate Cut Probability\nThe probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December dropped to 62%, from 68% earlier in the week, coinciding with rising US economic confidence. The final Eurozone Services PMI increased to 53.0 in October, evidencing improved European corporate earnings, with third-quarter growth expectations of 4.3%, far exceeding the forecasted 0.4%.\nThe EUR/USD pair remains in a correction phase within a broader bearish trend, facing resistance near the 1.1545 level. On the downside, key support is at 1.1470, and further, down around 1.1440 and 1.1390. The Euro\u2019s value is impacted by various economic indicators and central banking policies. Economic strength and inflation indicators inform rising or falling trends in its valuation.\nGiven the current market sentiment on November 6, 2025, we see the Euro\u2019s recent upward move as a temporary correction, not a change in the underlying trend. The disappointing Eurozone retail sales figures for September 2025 highlight persistent weakness in the bloc\u2019s economy. Recent inflation data reinforces this, with the latest October 2025 Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) showing a slowdown to 2.9%, making it harder for the European Central Bank to justify a hawkish stance.\nRobust US Economy\nIn contrast, the US economy appears more robust, as evidenced by the strong ADP employment and ISM Services data for October 2025. US inflation is also proving stickier, with the most recent Consumer Price Index data holding firm at 3.2%. This divergence strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for longer, which should continue to support the US Dollar.\nWe believe the path of least resistance for the EUR/USD is to the downside over the next few weeks. The key support levels to watch are near 1.1470, and a break below that could open the door to the 1.1440 area. Any rallies toward the resistance at 1.1545 should be seen as potential selling opportunities.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests that buying put options on EUR/USD could be a prudent strategy. A trader might consider puts with a strike price around 1.1450 expiring in late November or December to capitalize on a potential move lower. This approach offers a defined risk while providing exposure to the expected bearish trend.\nAlternatively, selling out-of-the-money call options or implementing a bear call spread could generate income while betting that the pair will not breach key resistance. A spread with a short strike above 1.1550 would align with the technical analysis that suggests significant selling pressure exists at that level. This strategy benefits from both a drop in price and time decay if the pair trades sideways or moves down.\nThis setup reminds us of the dynamic we observed in late 2023 and early 2024, when policy divergence between the Fed and the ECB drove significant dollar strength. Looking back, the market consistently underestimated the resilience of the US economy relative to Europe during that period. We may be seeing a similar pattern emerging now, making bearish Euro positions more compelling."

                "body": "FX: Dollar bears retreat further\nIt was barely six weeks ago that EUR/USD briefly traded over 1.19. However, seemingly strong activity data from the US, combined with a Federal Reserve less committed to easing, has seen it correct to 1.15. Bears have virtually given up. Low volatility appears to be the most likely path ahead, although we remain slightly negative on the dollar\nA more balanced market\nThe late October Federal Reserve meeting was the latest event to give the dollar a lift. Whether the Fed truly wants to introduce \u2018optionality\u2019 into the debate over future rate cuts, or genuinely does not know its next step, remains to be seen. Either way, the cornerstone of the bearish dollar consensus \u2013 lower Fed policy rates \u2013 just became more complicated.\nWe recently argued that lower short-dated US rates would weaken the dollar, as the buy-side increased FX hedge ratios on US assets again. However, if the policy rate is going to stick around 3.75% for a while, there will be no rush to increase hedge ratios.\nThe FX option market suggests that investors are more likely to exit dollar shorts in a passive move, rather than actively taking long dollar positions. Well, at least in the case of EUR/USD. Here, three-month traded volatility has sunk below 6.0% and appears poised to drop to the summer 2024 lows of 5.4%. This suggests investors are losing interest in the EUR/USD trend and probably favour a more listless, range-bound market into year-end.\nInvestors lose interest in the EUR/USD rally\nDollar negatives are still present\nWe think it\u2019s too early to call time on the dollar bear trend and the EUR/USD rally. The house call is for three more Fed rate cuts, and there is much uncertainty over both the shape of the US labour market and whether political pressure will bear down on the Fed next year. At the same time, lower energy prices in 2026 should remove one of the dollar\u2019s competitive advantages and be welcome news to fossil fuel importers, such as the eurozone.\nAlthough it may not seem relevant at the moment, the euro is expected to receive a boost from eurozone growth in 2026. Our macro team expects growth to accelerate in 2026 as German fiscal stimulus is implemented.\nOur 1.20 forecast for EUR/USD for the end of this year is now a bit of a stretch. But year-end seasonality and the true state of the US jobs market should be supportive. And some modest gains next year are still the preferred call.\nSterling in focus\nSofter inflation data and expectations of a fiscally tight budget from Chancellor Rachel Reeves later this month led to a drop in UK short-dated yields and sterling in October. Pricing for the 2026 Bank of England (BoE) easing cycle appears to be about right, with the terminal rate currently priced near 3.25%. As such, we don\u2019t think sterling needs to fall much further on the BoE story.\nThe budget is a major sterling event risk. Our base case sees sterling staying supported as Reeves does enough to support the gilt market without prompting a major reassessment of UK growth prospects and the BoE easing cycle. Reeves has to walk a fine line, however. Any further aggressive or less aggressive fiscal tightening is likely to be negative for the pound, with the latter scenario being more perilous.\nThis publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

                "body": "GBP/USD has shown a recovery, reaching 1.31 as the Pound strengthens. This upward movement comes amid expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) may be nearing an interest rate cut, despite high inflation figures.\nThe BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s recent decision to hold interest rates, with a narrow five-to-four vote, surprised many. This suggests the BoE might adjust its focus due to ongoing economic challenges despite stubbornly high inflation, currently at 3.8%.\nImpact Of US Government Shutdown\nThe US government\u2019s shutdown has postponed the release of its latest Nonfarm Payrolls data. This has shifted attention to private releases, with the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment and Consumer inflation expectations surveys still on schedule for release.\nThe Pound Sterling, the official currency of the United Kingdom, is a pivotal unit in global foreign exchange, accounting for 12% of all transactions. Its value is influenced by the BoE\u2019s monetary policy, with adjustments based on inflation aiming for a steady rate around 2%.\nEconomic data, such as GDP and trade balance, also affect the Pound\u2019s value. A positive trade balance strengthens the currency, while weak economic data might cause it to fall.\nGiven the Bank of England\u2019s surprisingly close 5-4 vote to hold rates, we believe the market has been caught leaning too bearishly on the Pound. The latest ONS data from October 2025 showed UK CPI holding stubbornly at 3.6%, yet the BoE\u2019s focus seems to be shifting toward the UK\u2019s weak economic growth. This suggests that the recent recovery in GBP/USD above 1.31 may have further to run.\nVolatility And Trading Strategies\nWe need to re-evaluate short positions, as the risk of a rate cut is now much higher than previously priced in. Recent CFTC data from the week ending November 4, 2025, showed speculative net short positions on GBP were at their highest level since the third quarter of 2024, suggesting the bearish trade was overcrowded. This tight positioning could fuel a more aggressive short-squeeze if the pair continues to climb.\nThis uncertainty from the BoE creates a perfect environment for higher volatility, a key consideration for derivative traders. We\u2019ve seen the 3-month implied volatility for GBP/USD options jump to over 10.5% this week, a sharp rise from the sub-8% levels we saw throughout October 2025. Strategies that profit from price swings, such as buying straddles, could be effective over the next few weeks.\nOn the other side of the pair, the ongoing US government shutdown is creating a data vacuum, with key releases like Nonfarm Payrolls suspended. This forces us to place more weight on private surveys, such as today\u2019s University of Michigan report, which can cause sharp, unpredictable moves in the dollar. This situation reminds us of the extended shutdown back in late 2018 and early 2019, which created similar data gaps and market jitters.\nConsidering the dovish surprise from the BoE and the unclear picture from the US, the path of least resistance for GBP/USD may now be to the upside. However, the risk of a sudden reversal remains high due to the persistent inflation problem in the UK. Using call options to gain bullish exposure could be a prudent way to manage risk, capping potential losses at the premium paid while participating in any further recovery."

                "body": "- The British pound rallied early Thursday following the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hold rates, but the overall trend remains bearish.\n- Resistance sits near 1.32, with downside risks below 1.30 potentially extending toward 1.2750.\nThe British pound has rallied significantly during the early hours on Thursday as the market reacts to the Bank of England and its interest rate decision, which was to keep things as they were. However, it\u2019s also worth noting that the Bank of England is narrowly maintaining its stance. With that being the case, I believe we are still very much in a downtrend, and I\u2019ll be watching the 1.32 level for potential resistance. That area had previously acted as support, and the 200-day EMA moving toward that zone also adds to the resistance that we could see on any attempt to break higher.\nTop Forex Brokers\nUltimately, this move looks like a rebound from the 1.30 level, a large round number with psychological significance that attracts plenty of market attention. If and when we break down below 1.30, the British pound will likely target the 1.2750 level. Conversely, a break above the 200-day EMA, currently at 1.3265, might signal a recovery, though it\u2019s important to remember that we remain well below that moving average, and this is what some people will look at to determine the longer-term trend in a market.\nThe 50-day EMA is now dropping sharply toward the 200-day EMA, setting up the possibility of a \u201cdeath cross.\u201d The prior uptrend line has been broken, retested, and then followed by another sell-off. All things considered, this is a market where traders are likely watching for signs of exhaustion to start selling into. While the pound\u2019s reprieve for the day may draw attention, it doesn\u2019t change the overall downward trajectory of this currency pair.\nReady to trade the Forex GBP/USD analysis and predictions?

                "body": "GBP/USD: BoE decision sets the stage for a December rate cut\nThe Bank of England left rates on hold this month at 4.0%, but the tone of the meeting was unmistakably dovish. The 5\u20134 vote split underscores just how divided the Monetary Policy Committee is\u2014and how much now depends on Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s stance heading into December.\nBailey\u2019s comments after the meeting were telling: while he acknowledged September\u2019s encouraging inflation data, he emphasized that it\u2019s just one data point. Yet, his increasing sympathy with the dovish camp\u2014who see the risks to inflation as now balanced\u2014suggests he\u2019s preparing to vote for a rate cut next month.\nWith two inflation prints and the Autumn Budget still to come, the data flow will likely confirm the BoE\u2019s shift toward easing. The Bank itself expects headline CPI to fall toward 3.5%, even as food inflation remains sticky. On the fiscal side, the Treasury\u2019s apparent commitment to front-loaded tax hikes (~\u00a315bn per year) adds another dovish layer, reinforcing the likelihood of a December rate cut.\nMarkets seem to agree. Sonia futures rallied 4\u20135bps at the short end, Gilts steepened bullishly, and Sterling softened modestly, reflecting the market\u2019s view that the BoE\u2019s terminal rate could fall to 3.25% by next summer.\nGBP/USD technical reaction\nToday\u2019s GBP/USD chart reflects that dovish shift perfectly.\nAs shown in the Elliott Wave structure above, the pair has likely completed a double complex correction (W\u2013X\u2013Y)within a broad descending channel. The latest leg lower\u2014wave (y)\u2014appears to have found support around 1.3050, coinciding with the lower channel boundary.\nMomentum indicators, such as the RSI (14) hovering near 33, signal that the pair is entering oversold territory, increasing the odds of a short-term bullish reversal.\nIf the structure holds, GBP/USD could now be primed for a corrective rebound or even the start of a new impulsive recovery wave, targeting the 1.3350\u20131.3450 zone initially. A sustained break above 1.3500 would confirm that the market has turned the page on its correction and is transitioning into a new bullish phase.\nOutlook\nFundamentally, the stars are aligning for a December rate cut, which should keep the macro backdrop dovish for the pound in the near term. However, given the scale of the correction and growing expectations of easing already priced in, GBP/USD may not have much more downside left.\nTechnically and sentiment-wise, this could mark the inflection point for a medium-term turnaround\u2014especially if next week\u2019s inflation data comes in softer and Governor Bailey cements his dovish bias.\nAuthor\nZorrays Junaid\nAlchemy Markets\nZorrays Junaid has extensive combined experience in the financial markets as a portfolio manager and trading coach.

That means they failed to benefit from a weak U.S. dollar amid signs of cracks in the U.S. labour market.\nThe Aussie AUDUSD was flat at $0.6480, having slipped 0.4% overnight to as low as $0.6464.

                "body": "Australian dollar faces make-or-\nbreak moment this Thursday\nAUD/USD fell from 0.6546 highs amid fresh concerns over China's economic recovery and Middle East tensions.\nAll eyes turn to Super Thursday's employment figures and potential RBA rate cut signals.\nGeopolitical and tariff pressures lead to AUD/USD slip from six-month high\nAustralian dollar/United States dollar (AUD/USD) finished marginally lower last week at 0.6487, down 0.09%, retreating from the fresh six-month high of 0.6546 reached earlier in the week.\nIts retreat followed risk-off flows triggered by Israel\u2019s strike on Iran and former United States (US) President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that Washington would begin issuing letters to trading partners outlining new tariff rates over the next fortnight.\nRisk sentiment improves as US futures rally\nWhile the situation in the Middle East remains volatile, risk sentiment has improved at the start of the week, with US 500 (S&P 500) equity futures trading nearly 1% higher at 6039.\nThe rebound appears supported by reports of Israel\u2019s success in targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, air defences, missile production, and senior military leaders - prompting speculation that the conflict may resolve faster than previously anticipated.\nChina concerns re-emerge\nDespite the improvement in risk sentiment, AUD/USD is trading fractionally lower today at .6479 (-0.12%), weighed down by the latest batch of weak Chinese economic data.\nNew home prices across 70 major Chinese cities declined 3.5% year-on-year (YoY) in May, the 23rd consecutive month of annual falls. Meanwhile, industrial production and fixed-asset investment also softened last month, suggesting that China's post-Covid-19 recovery remains unconvincing.\nHow AUD/USD tracks for the remainder of this week will depend on:\n- Geopolitical updates\n- Tariff developments\n- Outcome of 'Super Thursday', which includes a Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate meeting and an update on the Australian labour market previewed below.\nAustralian employment\nDate: Thursday, 19 June at 11.30am (AEST)\nIn April, the Australian economy added 89,000 jobs - nearly four times the market\u2019s forecast of 25,000. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, while the participation rate rose to 67.1% from 66.8%.\nDespite the strength of April\u2019s labour force report, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) proceeded with a 25 basis point (bp) interest rate cut at its following Board meeting. However, the solid jobs result likely influenced the central bank to avoid a larger 50 bp cut, especially with inflation now within the RBA\u2019s target band and external risks mounting.\nFor May, expectations are for a 20,000 job gain and for the unemployment rate to remain at 4.1%. Temporary hires related to the Fed election pose upside and downside risks to both metrics. Unless employment data substantially beats expectations, markets are anticipating another 25 bp rate cut on 8 July, which would lower the official cash rate to 3.60%.\nAs of Monday, the interest rate market was pricing in a 72% probability of a July cut, with cumulative easing of 75 bp projected by year-end.\nAU unemployment rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nThere is no change to our technical view.\nAfter completing a triangle-style 'ABCDE' five-wave correction in early April at the 0.6389 high, AUD/USD dropped to a low of 0.5912 on 9 April. From there, it rebounded back above 0.6500 in early May, leaving a V-shaped bottom, often seen at medium-term lows.\nAUD/USD has spent the past month consolidating its rebound from the April lows in a range between 0.6350 and 0.6540 - either side of the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at 0.6433.\nAfter the current consolidation period is completed (which may include a dip back towards 0.6350ish), we anticipate AUD/USD to extend its gains towards medium-term resistance at 0.6730 - 0.6750. This includes the 200-week MA and the downtrend line from the 0.8007 high of February 2021.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView"

                "body": "Japanese household spending figures signaled cooling private consumption, lifting USD/JPY early in the Asian session on Friday, November 7. Household spending has been a topic of discussion, given recent USD/JPY strength, triggering yen intervention warnings amid concerns about import prices.\nA weaker yen could lift import prices, affecting inflation and consumer spending. Weaker spending could affect the economy, given that private consumption accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nToday\u2019s data followed Japanese wage growth data for September, which signaled rising full-time wage growth, but softer part-time wages. Wage growth and consumer spending are two key considerations for the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary policy outlook.\nJapanese household spending increased 1.8% year-over-year in September, down from 2.3% in August. Weaker consumer spending could cool demand-driven inflation, supporting a less hawkish BoJ rate path. Fading bets on a December BoJ rate hike could ease demand for the yen.\nNotably, the mixed wage data and softer rise in household spending tempered bets on a BoJ rate hike. USD/JPY rose from 152.865 to 152.973 after the release of the data, reflecting a less hawkish BoJ policy stance.\nAverage cash earnings (nominal pay) rose 1.9% YoY in September, up from 1.3% in August, while real wages fell 1.4%.\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s so-called \u2018core-core\u2019 inflation rate eased from 3.3% in August to 3.0% in September, meaning wages are trailing price increases, affecting household purchasing power. Purchasing power could erode further if markets temper BoJ rate hike bets and the yen weakens, further reducing household purchasing power.\nWeakening purchasing power could ease inflationary pressures, affect the economy, and weigh on the yen, a vicious cycle for households, the BoJ, and the Japanese government, which is eyeing yen movements.\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently commented on wages and inflation, stating that price stability, coupled with wage gains, had yet to be achieved.\nWhile recent Japanese data could support a more dovish BoJ rate path, intervention threats would cap USD/JPY gains.\nWhile traders assess the latest Japanese data and the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook, the US government shutdown could leave markets without crucial labor market data later on Friday.\nThe shutdown dragged into day 38 on Friday, November 7, the longest in history. The US Senate impasse will leave University of Michigan \u2013 Surveys of Consumers and Fed speakers to influence USD/JPY trends.\nWaning consumer confidence and elevated inflation expectations could signal a pullback in consumer spending. Softer spending trends could dampen inflation and the US economy, given that private consumption accounts for roughly 65% of GDP.\nA cooling inflation outlook and potential loss of economic momentum may raise expectations of a December Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed rate path could push USD/JPY toward the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nOn the other hand, a pickup in consumer sentiment and easing inflation expectations could signal an upswing in consumer spending, supporting a less hawkish Fed policy stance. Fading bets on a December Fed rate cut could send USD/JPY toward the November 4 high of 154.483.\nBeyond the data, FOMC members\u2019 speeches will require consideration, given growing concerns about the US labor market. According to Challenger, Gray, & Christmas data, job cuts soared from 54.064k in September to 153.074k in October, raising bets on a December Fed rate cut.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a December policy adjustment rose from 62.0% to 70.6% on Thursday, November 6.\nGrowing Fed support for a rate cut in December could weigh on the US dollar, supporting a USD/JPY fall toward 151 and the 50-day EMA. Conversely, continued concerns about elevated inflation, despite a cooling labor market, may send the pair toward 154.483.\nGiven the US labor market data and potential impact on wage growth and spending, the n"

                "body": "The USD/JPY pair declines to approximately 153.05 during early trading in Asia on Friday. The US Dollar faces selling pressure due to the unresolved US government shutdown, which began on October 1, as Congress has yet to agree on funding negotiations.\nA record of over 150,000 job cuts by US companies in October was the largest for the month in over 20 years. The Federal Reserve\u2019s possible interest rate reduction in December and the hawkish minutes from the Bank of Japan\u2019s September meeting could influence the currency dynamics.\nBank Of Japan Policy Influence\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, particularly its stance on interest rates, plays an important role in the value of the Japanese Yen. A potential inability to decide the timing of policy changes might weigh on the Yen, despite recent favourable conditions for interest rate increases within the BoJ.\nJapan\u2019s currency, viewed as a safe-haven, can gain value during market stress, providing stability against riskier investments. However, long-term policy divergence between the BoJ and other central banks has historically impacted the Yen\u2019s value. The narrowing of differentials between US and Japanese bonds may impact future currency trends.\nGiven the slide in USD/JPY towards 153.00, we see opportunities in positioning for further downside in the coming weeks. The record-breaking US government shutdown, now at 38 days and surpassing the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019, is significantly damaging economic confidence. This political paralysis is creating a strong headwind for the US Dollar.\nImplications For Traders\nThe bleak US jobs report, showing a loss of over 150,000 private sector jobs, strongly signals a slowing economy. This has dramatically shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy, with fed funds futures now pricing in an 85% probability of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in December. We believe this makes holding long US Dollar positions increasingly risky against the Yen.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish tone from its September minutes suggests a policy shift is near. This sentiment has already pushed the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield above 1.0% for the first time in over a decade, narrowing the differential with US Treasuries. This fundamental change supports a stronger Yen, as the policy divergence that weakened it since 2022 is now reversing.\nFor derivative traders, this environment favors strategies that profit from a falling USD/JPY exchange rate. Buying put options on USD/JPY offers a way to speculate on further declines while defining maximum risk. Given the high uncertainty, implied volatility is increasing, which traders must factor into the pricing of any options strategy.\nThe Yen is also regaining its traditional safe-haven status as concerns grow over the US economy\u2019s health and its political instability. We saw a similar flight to safety during the peak of the banking turmoil back in 2023, which temporarily strengthened the Yen. A continuation of the US shutdown is likely to encourage more investors to seek refuge in the Japanese currency."

With political cover to wait, a December hike is far from guaranteed.\n- Japan\u2019s real wages fell for a ninth consecutive month in September\n- Governor Ueda signals no urgency to tighten before spring wage talks\n- Political pressure on BOJ remains low despite inflation overshoot\n- USD/JPY stalls at 154.50 resistance despite bullish trend\nSummary\nJapanese wages continue to go backwards after inflation, casting doubt on the BOJ\u2019s ability to generate sustainable, demand-driven price pressures. Governor Ueda\u2019s upcoming speech could be pivotal, especially following an upside surprise Tokyo CPI print last month. Yet with political leaders urging caution and wage growth tepid, the BOJ is not under pressure to hike despite continued inflation overshoots. USD/JPY\u2019s recent rally is showing signs of exhaustion, with resistance at 154.50 proving tough to overcome\u2014 a bullish break may require a hawkish shift in US rate expectations.\nJapan Real Wages Decline Again\nJapan\u2019s real wages declined again in September, extending their losing streak to a ninth consecutive month as inflation continued to outpace pay growth. While nominal cash earnings rose 1.9% from a year earlier, real wages fell 1.4% after adjusting for inflation, underscoring the strain on household purchasing power. With consumption making up the bulk of Japan\u2019s economy, the persistent erosion of real incomes remains a major obstacle to generating the kind of demand-driven inflation the Bank of Japan (BOJ) wants to see.\nSource: TradingView\nBOJ Keeps its Options Open\nThere\u2019s little sign of meaningful wage acceleration that might shift that dynamic. Governor Ueda\u2019s recent comments about wanting to see \u201cmomentum\u201d in the early stages of the 2026 spring wage talks suggest the BOJ is in no rush to move, implying a window in the first quarter of next year before the bank can make a confident assessment. Ueda\u2019s caution is arguably justified, given large annual wage increases agreed with unions over the past two years have yet to translate into similar outcomes across the broader economy.\nStill, the BOJ\u2019s somewhat unusual announcement last week that Ueda will deliver a speech on December 1\u2014just days after the next Tokyo inflation report\u2014is notable. The timing could give him optionality to prime markets for a potential December move, particularly after the last Tokyo release produced a sharp upside surprise in both core and headline readings.\nAs things stand, swaps markets put the implied probability of a 25bp rate hike at the BOJ\u2019s December 19 meeting at 50%, effectively deeming the outcome a coin toss. By March\u2014when spring wage negotiations will be in full swing\u2014a full hike is now all but fully priced.\nSource: Bloomberg\nIntervention Threat Appears Weak\nWhile Ueda\u2019s speech looms as a key event ahead, Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s remarks this week reinforced the sense that political pressure on the BOJ to act remains low. She said Japan is only halfway toward achieving sustainable inflation accompanied by wage gains, signalling she doesn\u2019t want to push the bank into tightening policy prematurely. It\u2019s a stance consistent with her reputation as a policy dove in the mould of former Prime Minister Abe, hinting she\u2019s not willing to risk weakening the economy and strengthening the yen despite inflation remaining well above the BOJ\u2019s 2% mandate.\nHer dovish stance makes it difficult to take her finance minister\u2019s warnings about yen movements too seriously, given USD/JPY remains a well-known play on rate differentials. Unless backed by fundamentals\u2014either through higher Japanese yields driven by a more hawkish BOJ or a meaningful decline in US Treasury yields\u2014any intervention from the BOJ at the government\u2019s request risks being ineffectual.\nSource: TradingView\nFinance Minister Satsuki Katayama reiterated on Tuesday that the government would continue "

Canada\u2019s Net Change in Employment and Unemployment Rate will also be eyed.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar faced challenges, as the Challenger Job Cuts report prompted the Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates at its December meeting. Challenger, Grey & Christmas on Thursday, announced that companies cut over 153,000 jobs in October, marking the biggest reduction for the month in more than 20 years.\nThe Greenback could depreciate further as the US government shutdown extends further, hitting a record with still no solution in sight. The Senate is not currently set to vote on a House-passed measure to reopen the government on Thursday, after it failed to advance for the 14th time on Tuesday.\nCanada\u2019s Ivey Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) declined to 51.7 in October, from 61.6 in September. Meanwhile, the seasonally-adjusted PMI fell to 52.4 from 59.8 prior, missing expectations of 55.2. The reading marks the sixth consecutive month above the 50-point threshold, signaling continued expansion in overall activity.\nBank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance on Wednesday that federal budget measures aimed at improving Canada\u2019s productivity could deliver results if implemented effectively. \u201cThese things are pointing in the right direction, but it\u2019s going to come down to execution,\u201d he said. The budget, presented to Parliament on Tuesday, allocates billions of dollars for infrastructure, productivity, defense, and housing investments.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive o"

Despite recent stability, the Canadian Ivey Purchasing Managers Index for October showed a greater decline in business sentiment than anticipated, indicating ongoing economic challenges.\nThe Loonie has decreased by 1.81% against the US Dollar over six trading days. The Ivey PMI dropped to 52.4, further than the expected fall from 59.8 to 55.2. Meanwhile, the US experienced substantial job cuts, marking one of the highest non-Covid reports, with 153K jobs lost in October.\nUsdcad Momentum\nUSD/CAD maintains its upward momentum, closing near 1.4120 after rebounding from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average at 1.3900. The pair is experiencing overbought conditions, with resistance at 1.4150 and support levels near 1.4000 and 1.3900. As the daily RSI hovers around 70, traders are monitoring whether USD/CAD will hold above 1.41.\nThe Canadian Dollar is influenced by several factors such as the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rates, Oil prices, and macroeconomic data. Economic health, oil price fluctuations, and inflation impact CAD, with the health of the US economy also playing a role. Macroeconomic indicators and Bank of Canada\u2019s policies directly affect the CAD\u2019s value.\nGiven the weakness in the Canadian dollar, we see the USD/CAD pair holding firm above the 1.4100 level. This follows disappointing Canadian Ivey PMI data and recent inflation figures from September 2025 showing CPI at 2.9%, which gives the Bank of Canada little reason to support the currency with a more hawkish tone. With the Canadian economy showing signs of slowing, the path of least resistance for the loonie appears to be downward.\nA key driver for this is the price of oil, which continues to put pressure on the Canadian dollar. Western Canadian Select has fallen over 8% in the past month to trade near $68 a barrel, a direct result of slowing global demand forecasts. This decline in Canada\u2019s largest export directly weighs on the value of the currency, and we expect this trend to continue as long as oil prices remain soft.\nImpact Of Us Factors\nOn the other side of the pair, the ongoing US government shutdown, now in its 42nd day, has created significant uncertainty by delaying official economic data like Non-Farm Payrolls. This lack of clear data has ironically strengthened the US dollar as investors seek safety, despite worrying private data like the recent Challenger Job Cuts report. The greenback is acting as a haven, and we are seeing that play out against the loonie.\nFor derivative traders, the overbought RSI signal near 70 suggests that outright long positions could be risky, making options a more prudent strategy. We believe buying call options on USD/CAD with strike prices above 1.4150 for the coming weeks offers a way to capitalize on further upside toward the 1.4415 target. This approach allows traders to limit downside risk if the pair sees a temporary pullback.\nThe current political uncertainty in the U.S. has also caused implied volatility to rise, which traders can use to their advantage. Looking back at the market swings during the 2024 US election, we saw how volatility can present opportunities. Traders anticipating a significant price move, but uncertain of the direction once the shutdown ends, could consider long straddles to profit from a breakout in either direction."

Fresh selling pressure hit after the currency broke below a key resistance level, according to analysts at CIBC Capital Markets. Oil\u2014a major income source for Canada\u2014also dragged things lower with prices down 1.6%, pushing US crude to $59.60 a barrel.

With the 10-year yield spread at its widest since June, more international money could flow into US markets, nudging Canadian asset prices lower.

If oil prices stay low and fiscal restraint takes a back seat, the loonie\u2019s weakness could linger\u2014pushing up borrowing costs for everyone from consumers to governments.

                "body": "GBP/JPY steadies near 201.00 after BoE keeps rates unchanged at 4%\n- GBP/JPY holds firm above 201.00 after the Bank of England keeps rates unchanged.\n- The BoE leaves Bank Rate at 4% in a close 5-4 split, with four members backing a 25-bps cut.\n- Governor Bailey says rates are likely to stay on a gradual downward path but remain restrictive until inflation eases further.\nThe British Pound (GBP) trades slightly firmer against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Thursday after the Bank of England (BoE) decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4%, in line with market expectations. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 201.18, rebounding from a knee-jerk low of 200.65 seen immediately after the monetary policy announcement.\nThe BoE\u2019s 5-4 vote revealed a close split within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), with four members favoring a 25 basis-point (bps) rate cut. Policymakers noted that inflationary pressures continue to ease, supported by slower wage growth and signs of weaker demand. Headline CPI stood at 3.8% in September, and the central bank expects inflation to fall to around 3% early next year, before returning toward the 2% target in 2027\nDespite a dovish tilt, the BoE emphasized that any future rate cuts would be \u201cgradual and data-dependent.\u201d The central bank\u2019s latest forecasts point to subdued Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth through the end of the year, with household spending restrained by high borrowing costs and an elevated saving ratio. According to the BoE\u2019s November Monetary Policy Report, market pricing now implies the Bank Rate will decline to around 3.5% in the second half of 2026.\nSpeaking at the post-meeting press conference, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank is likely to remain on a \u201cgradual downward path\u201d for interest rates, reaffirming that policy will stay restrictive for some time to ensure inflation returns sustainably to target. Bailey noted that economic activity remains below potential and the labor market is clearly slowing, with firms hiring less and employment subdued.\nHe cautioned, however, that inflation could remain sticky, emphasizing that policymakers need to see the downward path in price pressure become more established before considering further rate cuts. Bailey added that the Committee reassesses how restrictive policy is at each meeting, with no fixed view on the neutral rate.\nThe policy contrast between the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains a key driver for the pair. While the BoE signaled that interest rates are likely to move lower gradually through 2026 as inflation slows, the BoJ kept its policy rate unchanged at 0.50% last week but hinted that further tightening could be considered if inflation and wage growth strengthen. This policy gap continues to support the Pound\u2019s relative resilience against the Yen in the near term.\n(This story was corrected on November 6 at 13:36 GMT to fix the date in the first paragraph. It's Thursday, not Wednesday.)\nBoE FAQs\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterl"

                "body": "GBP/JPY stabilises above 201.00 after the Bank of England maintains its rate at 4%. The BoE\u2019s decision was reached with a close 5-4 vote, where four members supported a 25 bps cut.\nThe British Pound strengthened slightly against the Japanese Yen after the interest rate announcement. At the time, GBP/JPY traded around 201.18, recovering from a low of 200.65 following the BoE\u2019s statement.\nInflationary Pressures Decrease\nThe BoE reported inflationary pressures are decreasing, reflecting slow wage growth and weak demand signals. September\u2019s CPI was 3.8%, with expectations for it to drop to 3% early next year and nearing the 2% goal by 2027.\nDespite a dovish trend, the BoE stressed that any future rate cuts would be \u201cgradual and data-dependent.\u201d The forecast indicated subdued GDP growth through year-end, constrained by high borrowing costs and a high saving ratio.\nGovernor Bailey noted economic activity is under potential, and the job market is slowing. The policy difference between BoE\u2019s small rate decrease and the BoJ\u2019s unchanged 0.50% rate supports GBP\u2019s strength over JPY.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s decision to hold rates at 4% with a very close 5-4 vote signals a turning point. We see the path is now clearly tilted towards rate cuts in the coming months. This close division within the committee suggests the first cut could arrive sooner than previously expected, possibly in early 2026.\nInterest Rate Dynamics\nThis dovish stance is supported by weakening economic data, as the latest ONS figures showed UK wage growth cooled to 4.2% in October 2025. This is a significant slowdown from the peaks of over 8% that we saw back in mid-2023. Slower wage growth reduces inflationary pressure and gives the BoE more room to ease policy.\nOn the other side of the trade, the Bank of Japan is facing a different problem, with hints of future tightening. Japan\u2019s nationwide core CPI for October 2025 came in at 2.9%, staying above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over a year. This growing pressure on the BoJ to raise rates contrasts sharply with the BoE\u2019s position.\nFor derivative traders, this growing uncertainty suggests that implied volatility in GBP/JPY may be too low. We believe purchasing put options with expiries in the first quarter of 2026 could be a prudent way to position for a potential policy shift. This strategy offers a defined-risk way to profit from a decline if the BoE cuts rates sooner than the market is pricing in.\nWhile the 3.5% interest rate differential still supports the carry trade for now, its appeal is clearly diminishing. We think traders holding long GBP/JPY positions should consider hedging their exposure. Using forward contracts to lock in an exchange rate near the current 201.00 level could protect profits from a sudden downturn."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair remains steady near the 201.00 level as traders await the Bank of England (BoE) policy update. Concerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal position weigh on the British Pound, with the Yen strengthened by expectations of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike and potential intervention.\nThe pair tries to maintain gains after recovering from a one-month low near 199.00. Current trading reflects the anticipation surrounding the BoE decision, which will likely influence the British Pound and affect the GBP/JPY cross significantly.\nEconomic Indicators and Predictions\nEconomic indicators show softer inflation, fiscal challenges, and rising unemployment in the UK. Markets predict a 1-in-3 chance of a 25bps rate cut by the BoE and a 70% probability of a rate reduction by year-end.\nThe UK\u2019s fiscal outlook ahead of the Autumn budget remains a concern, alongside improvements in the Japanese Yen. BoJ\u2019s latest meeting minutes suggest an imminent rate hike, supporting the Yen. However, expectations of Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister increasing fiscal spending to counter inflation may limit the Yen\u2019s upside.\nThe BoE\u2019s interest rate decision is a key event, with potential policy changes impacting the Pound Sterling. The consensus for the next interest rate release remains at 4%.\nGiven the market\u2019s hesitation around the 201.00 level for GBP/JPY, we are bracing for volatility today, November 6, 2025. The immediate focus is the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision, which is expected to hold at 4%. Any dovish language hinting at a future cut could easily push the pair below the key 199.00 support level tested just yesterday.\nCurrent GBP/JPY Strategy\nThe case for a weaker Pound is growing, which should inform our strategy. The latest Office for National Statistics data showed UK inflation slowing to 2.8% in October, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline. With wage growth also cooling to 4.5% and unemployment ticking up to 4.5%, the BoE has a clear runway to ease policy without fearing an inflation spike.\nThis follows the BoE\u2019s first rate cut of this cycle back in August 2025, when they moved from 4.25% to the current 4%. We are also watching for fiscal pressures ahead of the Autumn Budget on November 26, which could further weigh on the Pound. Therefore, any rallies in GBP/JPY may offer selling opportunities in the coming weeks.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Yen is finding some support. We remember the Bank of Japan finally exited its negative interest rate policy back in March 2024, and with its policy rate now at 0.25%, the market is anticipating another hike by early 2026. This contrasts sharply with the BoE\u2019s easing stance, creating a fundamental divergence that favors a lower GBP/JPY.\nConsidering the pair is trading near levels not consistently seen since before the 2008 financial crisis, it appears overextended. The combination of a dovish BoE and a cautiously hawkish BoJ suggests a downward correction is likely. A sustained break below the 199.00 one-month low would signal that this downward move has begun, and we should be positioned accordingly."

Among the most trusted names in the investment industry, The Vanguard Group stands out for its low-cost, long-term, index-fund approach. Yet despite the growing popularity of Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Vanguard has chosen a firm and cautious path: it does not offer a spot Bitcoin ETF at this time.\nWhat Is a Bitcoin ETF?\nA Bitcoin ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund that is designed to track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without needing to buy or store the cryptocurrency directly.\nSome Bitcoin ETFs are backed by futures contracts linked to Bitcoin; others are \u201cspot\u201d products that hold actual Bitcoin. The benefit of an ETF structure is its familiarity and accessibility through brokerage accounts, whereas the risks include heightened volatility, evolving regulation, and the particular complexities inherent to crypto assets.\nVanguard\u2019s Current Position on Bitcoin and ETFs\nVanguard does not offer a spot Bitcoin ETF, and the firm publicly shared that it has no immediate plans to launch one. Its long-established investment philosophy centres on assets that generate cash flows or have clear valuation mechanisms\u2014such as stocks and bonds.\nIn contrast, Bitcoin is viewed by Vanguard leadership as highly speculative, lacking intrinsic economic value or predictable return streams. The firm has argued that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, regulatory uncertainties and valuation challenges make it incompatible with its core mandate of serving long-term investors.\nIf you are looking for direct exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF, Vanguard currently is not the venue. You will need to explore other providers that offer spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nOn the flip side, if you favour Vanguard for its conservative, broad-based investing approach and prefer avoiding high-volatility assets, then Vanguard\u2019s position may align well with your preferences. Investors should weigh whether their goals include crypto exposure\u2014or instead focus on the more traditional paths Vanguard offers."

The round also included A Capital, Atka Capital, Bond St Ventures, Topology, and Uniswap Labs Ventures. Several well-known crypto figures, such as Ameen Soleimani, Eva Beylin, and Chen Zituo, joined as angel investors. The company calls its model \u201csolving-as-a-service,\u201d designed for the off\u2011chain bots, algorithms, and market\u2011makers that power on\u2011chain transactions behind the scenes.\nWhat the Platform Is Built to Do\nSprinter is currently running in private beta and is developing two key products. The first, called Sprinter Stash, acts as a cross\u2011chain credit protocol that gives solvers and market\u2011makers access to liquidity without needing to lock up collateral. The second, Sprinter Solve, is an API service that lets dApps, wallets, and protocols request quotes and complete swaps through solvers.\nLiquidity providers can deposit USDC into Sprinter Stash to earn solver fees, creating a shared liquidity pool for execution. The team also plans to launch its own token, SPRINT, which will reward liquidity providers, solver operators, and community members through a governance model known as veSPRINT.\nThe Team Behind the Code\nThe founders of Sprinter come from Ethereum\u2019s early ecosystem, giving the project a layer of technical credibility. Aidan Hyman, who leads ChainSafe Systems, and Dean Eigenmann, previously of ENS, are among the core team members. Their backgrounds in protocol engineering and infrastructure design have helped shape Sprinter into something that targets performance and reliability instead of speculative hype.\nDISCOVER: Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in\nWhy DeFi Needs a Service Like This\nIn decentralized finance, solvers play a crucial role by executing trades, liquidations, and complex on\u2011chain operations. However, access to capital and efficiency in this sector remain major challenges.\nSprinter aims to streamline that process by connecting solvers to shared liquidity while offering developers tools to integrate solving directly into their products. The goal is to make transaction execution smoother, cheaper, and more consistent across multiple chains, benefiting both DeFi users and the protocols they interact with.\nWhat Comes Next for the Startup\nWith the seed round complete, Sprinter will spend the coming months expanding its private beta, onboarding liquidity providers, and testing cross\u2011chain integrations. The team is also working on refining the governance structure for SPRINT before launching it publicly."

                "body": "Ethereum remains a key pillar in the crypto market, but its current trading behavior polarizes analyst perspectives on its future. To some traders, Ethereum may be due for a brief retreat before making its run for $5,000. Such a retreat has been compared to the past accumulation phases seen before major rallies.\nMeanwhile, investor interest is slowly expanding toward utility-driven DeFi projects, such as Remittix (RTX) for connecting crypto payments to traditional finance.\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,414.59, down 2.49% over the past 24 hours. The asset's market capitalization stands at $410.09 billion while trading volume is up at $70.31 billion, indicating high market activity despite the pullback.\nAnalysts further note that Ethereum's technical indicators still point towards a possible short-term correction around $2,800 before any sustained move higher. The liquidity zones below $3,000 are likely to be attractive for institutional buyers who wait for deeper entries.\nOn-chain data is also showing increased stablecoin inflows to exchanges-a sign of potential reaccumulation phases often seen before upward expansions.\nWhile the larger cryptocurrency market consolidates, Remittix is positioning itself as a real-world payment bridge between blockchain assets and fiat systems. At $0.1166 per token, the Remittix token has already raised more than $28 million in private funding and has sold over 684 million tokens-a testament to strong, early backer confidence.\nFollowing positive reviews from its first round of testing, the Remittix Beta Wallet is now onboarding more iOS holders. This latest onboarding represents another milestone in the road to large-scale usability for the project.\nThe Remittix team is also fully verified and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, underlining its commitment to transparency and security.\nThe Elements Shaping Remittix's Investor Appeal:\nWhether Ethereum retreats below $3,000 depends heavily on how well it can defend this zone in the short term.\nMeanwhile, innovation-led projects like Remittix are broadening the market's narrative beyond speculation -- toward adoption, payments, and utility.\nAs the market transitions into its next growth phase, Ethereum's resilience, combined with the rise of purpose-driven DeFi solutions, will likely define where capital flows next.

                "body": "November 6, 2025 \u2013 The cryptocurrency market is currently grappling with a significant period of indecision, with Ethereum (ETH) finding itself in a prolonged phase of \"trading sideways.\" This stagnation, particularly noticeable in the latter half of 2025, has sparked a vigorous debate among investors and enthusiasts: is this a healthy consolidation before a major breakout, or a precursor to Ethereum potentially \"falling to its lowest levels since 2022\"?\nThe trend of limited upward movement became more pronounced in mid-October 2025, following a broader range-bound existence throughout much of the year. This market indecision is largely fueled by a confluence of factors, including macroeconomic pressures such as an uncertain interest rate outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve and a strengthening U.S. dollar, which traditionally drain liquidity from risk assets. The immediate market reaction has been one of \"fear\" or \"extreme fear,\" as reflected by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeting from \"greed\" just a month prior. This environment has prompted many crypto enthusiasts to actively seek out alternatives to Ethereum, with competitors like Solana and Cardano gaining renewed attention. The implications for the broader crypto ecosystem are substantial, as Ethereum's performance often dictates the sentiment and trajectory for numerous altcoins, DeFi protocols, and Web3 applications built upon its foundation.\nMarket Impact and Price Action\nEthereum's price action throughout late October and early November 2025 has been a rollercoaster of dips and cautious rebounds. Entering November, ETH faced renewed selling pressure, continuing a challenging October that saw losses nearing 17%. By early November, the price hovered around $3,297.90, failing to sustain above the crucial $3,550 mark. A notable event occurred on November 5th, when Ethereum briefly dipped to $3,053, nearly breaching the psychological $3,000 threshold, before a swift rebound. As of November 6, 2025, Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,407, showing a modest 3.29% increase over the preceding 24 hours, with an intraday low around $3,050 and a high near $3,423.\nTrading volume has presented a mixed picture. While daily trading volumes for ETH typically exceed $10 billion, reflecting its status as an actively traded asset, a significant 51% drop in daily volume was observed over a 24-hour period leading up to November 6th. Conversely, during periods of intense volatility, such as November 4th, trading volume surged by 173.53%, indicating active market participation, likely driven by selling pressure. This suggests a decline in short-term trading activity, yet overall market participation remains robust.\nLiquidity dynamics have also been critical. Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced substantial outflows, with $219 million in net outflows on November 4th, marking the fifth consecutive day of withdrawals. These outflows continued, with Ethereum ETFs seeing $118 million in withdrawals by November 6th, extending their losing streak to six days. This trend suggests a shift in institutional portfolios towards Bitcoin ETFs, which observed mild inflows. Interestingly, Ethereum exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level since 2016, indicating that major holders, often referred to as \"whales,\" are moving their assets off trading platforms into long-term storage. This action, while reducing immediate selling pressure, also points to an accumulation phase, suggesting a nuanced institutional perspective beyond the ETF outflows.\nTechnically, several key support and resistance levels are in focus. Immediate support was tested around $3,600, with a strong on-chain cluster between $3,649 and $3,686. If the $3,600 level breaks decisively, the next crucial support zone lies between $3,300 and $3,400, with further levels at $3,250, $3,200, and potentially $3,120, $3,050, and $3,000. The brief dip to $3,053 on November 5th was met with buying interest, solidifyi"

Both blockchains are attracting attention, but their growth patterns look very different.\nLet\u2019s compare Solana vs NEAR, looking at short-term NFT volumes, active users, and where the most activity is happening to see which one is showing a real breakout.\nRELATED: Solana vs Avalanche: Which Chain Has the Edge This Altseason?\nSolana vs NEAR: Chain Activity and NFT Volume Snapshot\nSolana leads in overall NFT trading and user activity. Data shows Solana NFT volumes hovering around the upper hundreds of thousands of dollars daily, spread across marketplaces such as Magic Eden, Tensor, and SolSea.\nThis broad distribution shows that activity is coming from many collections rather than just a few large ones. On top of that, Solana continues to host millions of NFT mints and growing gaming-related projects, which keeps its on-chain movement high.\nNEAR, by contrast, records smaller but noticeable surges, mainly centered around its main NFT platform, Paras.\nThe marketplace has seen about half a million dollars in trading volume over the past month, showing growing collector interest. However, NEAR\u2019s ecosystem remains less diversified, with fewer active NFT collections compared to Solana.\nRECOMMENDED: 5 Reasons Solana (SOL) Could Explode in 2025\nSolana vs NEAR: Marketplaces and Gaming Momentum\nSolana\u2019s growth this week comes from steady trading across many collections and the release of several new GameFi titles. The activity looks consistent, not just the result of one or two big projects.\nNEAR\u2019s volume spikes, meanwhile, are often tied to specific NFT drops or a single game launch, creating sharp but brief jumps in engagement. While those bursts show strong community response, they don\u2019t yet match Solana\u2019s broader base of ongoing activity.\nKey Signals to Track\nThe clearest signs of a breakout are increasing 24-hour NFT volume, rising numbers of unique buyers, and higher daily users in gaming projects.\nSustained growth across these areas points to lasting strength rather than short-term hype.\nRECOMMENDED: 5 Reasons To Buy NEAR Protocol in 2025\nConclusion\nOur Solana vs NEAR analysis shows that Solana has a stronger and more consistent breakout in NFT and gaming activity. NEAR is gaining attention through focused launches, but Solana\u2019s wider participation and steady trading make it the more active network right now.\nJoin eToro today and receive $10 in free crypto on your first deposit.

                "body": "Breaking News\nBitso Integrates USDT on Solana to Enable Faster and More Affordable Stablecoin Transactions\nBitso, Latin America\u2019s leading digital financial services company, announced the integration of Tether (USDT) on the Solana blockchain, expanding its stablecoin offering to deliver faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions while unlocking seamless access to Solana\u2019s thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\nWith this new integration, Bitso users can now send and receive USDT almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost compared to other networks. It also opens the door to a wide range of DeFi applications within Solana, one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in the world.\n\u201cThe adoption of stablecoins is redefining how people use crypto, not just as an investment, but as a functional tool for payments, savings, and protection against inflation. By adding USDT on Solana, we\u2019re providing our users with a faster and more accessible way to move money and participate in the ever evolving digital economy,\u201d said Alex Mehrdad, General Manager of Bitso Retail.\nAccording to Bitso\u2019s Crypto Landscape Report for the first half of the year, stablecoins were the most purchased crypto assets among Bitso clients in Latin America, accounting for 46% of all transactions in the region. USDT led the way, representing 23% of purchases and reinforcing its dominance amid growing demand for digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar.\nSolana is designed for high-speed, low-cost transactions and has become a leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second while maintaining minimal fees, Solana provides an ideal infrastructure for digital assets such as USDT, which are increasingly used by individuals and businesses around the world to power payments, remittances, and DeFi operations.\nThrough this integration, Bitso users can now leverage USDT on Solana to send and receive funds, interact with decentralized applications, and access key DeFi protocols such as Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca for trading; Solend and MarginFi for lending and borrowing; or Jito and Kamino for staking and yield optimization strategies.\nGetting started is simple: users can select USDT in their Bitso wallet, choose Solana (SOL) as the network, and deposit or withdraw to any Solana-compatible wallet. From there, they can connect to leading Solana-based DeFi platforms and explore new ways to use and grow their crypto.\nThe integration of USDT on Solana reinforces Bitso\u2019s commitment to innovation and financial inclusion by providing individuals and businesses in Latin America with efficient, transparent, and borderless tools to manage digital assets and participate in the global financial ecosystem.\nPeople In This Post\nCompanies In This Post\n- Hyper-Personalisation to Agentic AI: The Next Phase for Banks | Newgen | The Fintech Show #160 Read more\n- FF News Tattoo Studio: Form3 Setting the Standard for A2A Payments Read more\n- One Week to Go: Countdown to Finnovex Middle East 2025 Read more\n- Momentum Series Launches Second Book on Gen Y and Gen Z Builders Re-defining Technology, Leadership and Purpose for Insurance and Banking Read more\n- ALTA \u2013 Blockchain Labs Redefines the Traditional IPO Through Tokenization Read more"

                "body": "Interview by Tong, PANews\nEdited by: Yuliya, PANews\nEleven years ago, Shanghai became the first stop for Lily Liu, Chair of the Solana Foundation, as she entered the world of crypto. Eleven years later, she returns with a deep understanding of and strong commitment to the Chinese-speaking market.\nIn this PANews interview, Lily Liu shared her understanding of the underlying logic of blockchain, the development of the Internet, and the PayFi concept. She explained why Solana has increased its investment in the Chinese-speaking region since 2023, and how Solana is building open financial infrastructure globally and promoting developer ecosystem and digital asset innovation.\nA non-technical background, starting his crypto enlightenment in Shanghai\nPANews: In your speech at Wanxiang, you mentioned your deep connection with Shanghai. Eleven years ago, you worked in Shanghai, and it was there that you first encountered the crypto world. Could you tell us about that time?\nLily Liu: That was in 2013. My good friend Bobby Lee founded BTCC, one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in China. We were alumni and had known each other since 2012. One day, while we were playing poker, he suddenly started talking to me about Bitcoin and gave a speech in Shanghai, almost preaching about Bitcoin as a \"religion.\" At the time, I was quite curious, but also a little skeptical, wondering if Bitcoin was some kind of \"money laundering tool\" or some kind of informal technology.\nBobby encouraged me to read the Bitcoin white paper. I read it several times and found that although it's not long, it proposes a very innovative technical architecture. Although I don't have a technical background, I can see that this is a real breakthrough, not just a \"tool for playing with money,\" but a new direction brought about by the combination of economics and technology.\nThe white paper was titled \"Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash,\" a concept I found very interesting at the time. It essentially proposed a new phase of the internet. Looking back at the development of the internet, we have gone through two phases: the information internet and the mobile internet, while Web3 is the \"internet of assets.\"\nLooking back at the history of the internet, there's an uncommon status code in the HTTP protocol called \"402 Payment Required,\" which evoked the idea of native internet payments as early as 30 years ago. However, at that time, the technology wasn't mature enough, and people couldn't retain value in the electronic world.\nThe fundamental innovation of blockchain is establishing a trusted ledger on the internet. Since the birth of Bitcoin in 2008, this innovation has developed into a complete economic system. And all my understanding of the crypto world began in Shanghai.\nIncrease efforts to develop the Chinese-speaking region and be optimistic about its payment potential.\nPANews: Your Chinese was noticeably more fluent during your exchange in Shanghai this time than it was in Hong Kong two years ago. Is this because you spent a lot of time in Chinese-speaking regions over the past two years?\nLily Liu: Yes. I've lived in Beijing and Shanghai before. Improving your language skills definitely requires an environment. Opportunities were limited in the past few years, but since 2023, I've started focusing on the Chinese-speaking market.\nThe Chinese-speaking region is highly active and strong in terms of developers, innovation, and capital. Solana aims to build deep connections with this community and drive ecosystem growth. Since 2023, we have launched developer training, community building, incubation support, and investment programs to encourage developers in the Chinese-speaking region to participate in the Solana ecosystem and explore the potential of SVM. These efforts are establishing a solid technical and talent foundation for Solana in the Chinese-speaking region.\nPANews: I know that Solana holds various developer events around the world, including in Europe, India, and the Unit"

Norway\u2019s $1.9 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which owns about 1.2% of Tesla, has already vowed to vote against the deal, citing its size and the risk of overdependence on a single individual.\n1.31pm: US stock futures marginally higher\nUS stocks are predicted to start higher after Challenger job cuts data pointed to hiring slowing to a 14-year low.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both being called just over 0.1% higher on the futures market, while Dow Jones futures were up 0.05%.\nAs a reminder, Wednesday saw Wall Street stocks shook off Tuesday's heavy losses as dip-buying investors pounced and fresh ADP jobs data lifted the mood, with the Nasdaq climbing 0.7%, the Dow up 0.5% and the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%.\nFlorida-based market analyst Kenny Polcari says: \"It was NOT a buying frenzy at all, nor was it a stampede, but let\u2019s make sure we are on the same page.\"\nTuesday's dramatic response to Palantir\u2019s earnings and guidance \"reminds us just how stretched this market is and how headline-sensitive it has become. One bad headline and it's risk-off as the algos accentuate the negatives and eliminate the positives while one good headline causes a risk-on mentality that accentuates the positives and eliminate the negatives\".\nThe thing to watch, he says, i"
