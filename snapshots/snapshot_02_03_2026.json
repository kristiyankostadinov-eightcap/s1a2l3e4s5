                "body": "Gold and silver prices are slumping after their meteoric rise. Here's why.\nThe shine is coming off gold and silver. Prices for the precious metals, which last week soared to record highs, are extending their slide after a sharp selloff on Friday.\nGold, which topped $5,500 last week, dipped below $4,500 per ounce in overnight trading. Friday's decline amounted to the biggest one-day drop in the shiny metal's price since 2013, noted Pepperstone senior research strategist Michael Brown. Silver also suffered its worst daily loss, tumbling more than 31%.\nAs of 10:30 a.m. EDT, gold and silver had rebounded to $4,779 and $81.\nWhat's behind the metals meltdown?\nInvestors have poured into the metals in the last year amid concerns about mounting global geopolitical uncertainty and government borrowing, as debt levels across the U.S. and other major economies continue to rise.\nThe sell-off on Friday came after President Trump announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee to succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. Although Warsh has over the last year argued in favor of lowering interest rates, he is generally viewed as \"hawkish\" on inflation.\nWith consumer prices still running above the Fed's annual 2% target, that could incline Warsh against the kind of aggressive rate-cutting that President Trump has demanded, according to Wall Street analysts. Gold prices often (though not always) fall as interest rates rise because holdings of the metal don't pay interest, leading investors to rotate into stocks and other risk assets in search of higher returns.\nThe plunge in precious metal prices was also fueled by a rebound in the dollar, which had fallen to its lowest level in four years before Warsh was nominated as Fed chair, according to JPMorgan analysts. The values of gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions.\n\"We get a catalyst of a rebound in the U.S. dollar, to some degree on the back of the nomination of Warsh, and from that perspective, that's really the trigger that leads to very swift, significant de-risking... and the real sharp rollover into Friday,\" Gregory Shearer, executive director of global commodities research at J.P. Morgan, in a call with clients on Monday.\nOther factors also fed into the sell-off. Investors had borrowed heavily capitalize on the run-up in gold over the last year. But once prices began to slide, many of those same investors faced rising margin requirements, the minimum amount set by brokerage firms to maintain their leveraged position, according to Nigel Green, CEO of financial consulting firm deVere Group.\n\"Many chose, or were forced, to sell,\" Green said in an email. \"This process pushes prices lower regardless of fundamentals.\"\nWhere are precious metal prices headed now?\nOn Wall Street, opinions are mixed on where gold and silver prices go from here.\n\"The recovery may not be immediate or dramatic, but we believe the mechanics favor a bounce rather than continued freefall once the forced phase ends,\" Green said.\nJPMorgan analysts also think the hard assets are likely to recover. In a research note, commodities analysts with the bank lifted their year-end target for gold to $6,300.\nBut Neil Shearing, group chief economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, said in a research note that he expects gold to end the year \"well below current levels.\"\n\"While some market participants may be buying gold due to genuine concerns about the global economic and political backdrop, our sense is that market exuberance and a dose of FOMO are inflating a bubble in gold,\" he added."

While recent depreciation has pushed the dollar closer to fair value, BCA says the greenback \"is still expensive,\" and faster earnings growth outside the U.S. has reduced the relative appeal of U.S. assets on a cyclical basis.\nPositioning and sentiment indicators continue to lean against the greenback, while the sharp rise in gold prices is also seen as an unfavorable signal for the dollar.\nAt the same time, MacroQuant has turned decisively constructive on commodities. Gold remains a core bullish call within the model, which \"has been very bullish on the yellow metal for most of the past two years,\u201d supported by central bank buying, strong long-term price momentum, positive sentiment and concerns over fiscal policy.\nAlthough overbought conditions are tempering the near-term score, the model continues to project positive returns.\nCopper has seen an even stronger shift in conviction. The firm highlights that the model \u201cis now extremely bullish on the red metal,\u201d reflecting an improved economic outlook in the U.S. alongside continued support from sentiment and price momentum indicators.\nThe oil score has \"increased meaningfully, moving into bullish territory,\u201d BCA stresses, driven by strong price momentum and heightened geopolitical tensions that have lifted crude prices. Beyond those risks, the model points to firm global growth signals, manufacturing data and the outperformance of cyclical equities as reinforcing a more positive oil outlook.\nOverall, \"the model has upgraded oil from extreme underweight to modest overweight, and copper from neutral to extreme overweight.

                "body": "By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. stocks rose on Monday following sharp swings that shook financial markets overnight, including tumbles for Asian stocks. Gold and silver prices sank further following their latest wild moves.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 added 0.5% and snapped a three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 515 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.\nStocks of companies that make computer storage helped lead the market, adding to gains from last week following several profit reports that topped analysts\u2019 expectations. Airlines and cruise-ship operators were also strong, benefiting from a sharp easing of oil prices.\nThe center of action in financial markets was again precious metals, where momentum has suddenly halted after gold\u2019s price roughly doubled in just 12 months.\nGold briefly dropped below $4,500 per ounce in the overnight hours, down more than $1,000 from its high point reached just last week. It then climbed back above $4,800 before settling at $4,652.60, down 1.9% from Friday.\nSilver\u2019s price has been on an even wilder ride recently, and it swung from a 9% loss overnight to a modest gain and back to a loss of 1.9%.\nGold and silver prices had surged as investors looked for safer things to own amid a wide range of worries, including a Federal Reserve that may be set to become less independent, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide.\nTheir prices cratered on Friday, including a 31.4% plunge for silver. Some on Wall Street saw it as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Fed. Warsh\u2019s reputation as a former Fed governor may have raised expectations that he may keep interest rates high to fight inflation, which would reduce the need to hide out in gold and silver for protection.\nBut many on Wall Street are also skeptical of that initial reading and say the expectation from Trump is likely that Warsh will cut interest rates, something the president has been demanding. That could give the economy a boost but also worsen inflation over the long term.\nThe Fed\u2019s chair has a big influence on the economy and markets worldwide by helping to dictate where the U.S. central bank moves interest rates. That affects prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the U.S. job market humming without letting inflation get out of control.\nThe recent swoons for gold and silver may also simply mark the return of gravity for two investments whose price shot very high, very fast. They\u2019re likely more about the washout for some traders who had borrowed money to bet on metals\u2019 prices continuing to soar, rather than about a wholesale change in expectations for demand for metals, according to Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo.\nOn Wall Street, Sandisk leaped 15.4% to lead the S&P 500. The data-storage company added to its 6.9% gain from Friday, after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It credited demand created by the artificial-intelligence boom, among other things.\nThat helped offset a 2.9% drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world\u2019s move into AI technology. The losses were worse in Asia, where AI winners plunged. South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 5.3% from its record for its worst day in almost 10 months after chip company SK Hynix lost nearly 9%.\nThe Walt Disney Co. fell 7.4% even though the entertainment giant reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned of challenges that are keeping international visitors away from its U.S. theme parks, among other things.\nOil prices dropped more than 4% after Trump told reporters that Iran is \u201cseriously talking to us.\u201d It\u2019s a potential signal of improving relations between the two countries, which could keep oil flowing easily around the world.\nThe drop in oil pr"

WTI prices remain under pressure as markets react to signs of easing tensions between the United States (US) and Iran, which could alter supply expectations in the global energy market.\nSentiment deteriorated after comments from US President Donald Trump, who said on Sunday that the United States hopes to reach a deal with Iran. These remarks come against a backdrop of regional tensions, after Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a US attack could trigger a broader conflict. For investors, the prospect of an agreement with Iran, one of the main producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), could pave the way for a relaxation of sanctions and, eventually, an increase in Crude Oil supply, weighing on WTI prices.\nAt the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+), confirmed on Sunday its decision to keep output unchanged for March. The group also announced that its next meeting will take place on March 1. This decision follows the earlier freeze of planned production increases, reflecting expectations of seasonally weaker demand in the coming months. While this supply discipline aims to support market stability, it has not been enough to offset the negative impact of recent geopolitical developments.\nTraders are now turning their attention to upcoming US Oil inventory data, with the American Petroleum Institute (API) report due on Tuesday.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC in"

The DXY, which measures the buck\u2019s performance against a basket of other currencies, is up 0.46% at 97.60.\nExpectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates continue to diminish following the release of solid US economic data.

Hence, the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) report justified the Fed\u2019s decision.\n- German Retail Sales increased less than expected in December, rose by 0.1% compared with the previous month, data showed on Monday.\n- Ahead of this week, the docket in Europe will feature the European Central Bank (ECB) Lending Survey, inflation for the bloc, Retail Sales and the monetary policy meeting of the ECB.\n- In the US, the schedule will feature the ADP Employment Change for January, S&P and ISM Services PMIs and speeches by Federal Reserve officials.\nTechnical outlook: Euro poised to challenge 1.1700\nIn the short-term the EUR/USD technical picture, depicts the pair is tilted to the downside after clearking a key support level at 1.1830 the July 1, which exacerbated the Euro\u2019s sell-off past the 1.1800 figure.

                "body": "GBP/USD outlook: Currency Pair of the Week | February 2, 2025\nThe GBP/USD outlook is in focus this week, with both sides of the pair offering meaningful catalysts. The US dollar stabilised on Friday after its wobble recent wobble, helped by a correction in precious metals and a reassessment of how far the recent US dollar sell-off can really stretch. At the same time, sterling faces a key test with the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision on Thursday. The cable has room to fall in the short-term outlook.\nDollar finds support as data takes centre stage\nThe dollar is looking a bit more stable after what had started to feel like an overextended sell-off in January. Part of the move lower seemed driven by the debasement trade, which was especially visible in the surge in gold and silver. But that narrative has cooled as precious metals corrected and as Kevin Warsh, who is not an outright dove or hawk, emerged as Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for Federal Reserve Chair.\nIn fact, the recent dollar selling looked increasingly detached from the macro backdrop, and a corrective move higher was long overdue. After all, US economic growth remains decent while financial conditions are not especially tight. While the labour market has cooled, it hasn\u2019t been alarming enough to warrant such a big slide in US dollar.\nWith the dollar rebounding slightly, traders will now want validation from incoming data. That brings this week\u2019s heavy US calendar into focus. ISM surveys, JOLTS, ADP and Friday\u2019s payrolls should give a fairly comprehensive read on whether the US slowdown remains orderly.\nFor the jobs report, the market is looking for a print of around 67-70K with unemployment rate seen steady at 4.4%. That\u2019s not strong, but it is consistent with a cooling economy rather than one slipping into recession \u2013 a backdrop that still argues for near-term dollar stabilisation rather than a renewed sell-off.\nGBP/USD outlook: Bank of England could signal March cut\nOn the UK side, the Bank of England is almost certain to keep rates on hold come Thursday. That won\u2019t shock anyone given December\u2019s relatively hawkish cut \u2013 where the Bank warned that the tempo of rate cuts could slow, and we haven\u2019t had much in the way of new information since. Therefore, BoE policymakers have little incentive to rush into further easing, especially with the internal split also being well established. With that in mind, markets shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the likes of Alan Taylor and Swati Dhingra were to vote for a cut again.\nSince the December meeting, the UK data has been mixed: weak jobs numbers, slightly better PMIs, and inflation a touch higher than expected at 3.4% y/y. None of that forces the Bank\u2019s hand.\nThat said, the direction of travel is clearly dovish for UK inflation and interest rates, and possibly the GBP/USD outlook. Wage growth is falling quickly, hiring surveys continue to weaken, and headline inflation is expected to drop sharply into the spring once the impact of base effects fall out of the y/y equation. That keeps a March rate cut firmly on the table. But will the Bank actively signal that this week? I am doubtful. But I do expect to hear is the typical message to signal options are wide open and that data will guide timing of the next rate move.\nSo, what does it all mean for the GBP/USD outlook?\nThe GBP/USD could be facing some resistance here amid a stabilising dollar, and ahead of the BoE rate decision where policymakers are likely to stick to a cautious, non-committal tone. Technically, the inverted hammer-like candle on the weekly chart of the cable is bearish-leaning \u2013 especially given the false breakout above last year\u2019s high of 1.3789. Last week\u2019s low of 1.3641 needs to be watched now for a potential breakdown. A clean move below this level could put the next zone of support between 1.3500-1.3568 into focus next.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general publ"

The Pound Sterling (GBP) gathers strength against the Greenback on the cautiously hawkish stance of the Bank of England (BoE). All eyes will be on the BoE interest rate decision later on Thursday.\nThe BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to cut the Bank Rate in December, the fourth quarter-point reduction of 2025. But most of its policymakers suggested the pace of rate cuts could slow. The UK central bank will announce its policy decision later this week, and most economists expect the UK central bank to keep the benchmark rate on hold at 3.75% due to persistent inflation.\nOn the other hand, the upbeat US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) could underpin the US Dollar (USD) and create a headwind for the major pair. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) report on Monday showed that the US Manufacturing PMI exceeded expectations, rising to 52.6 in January from 47.9 in December. This report suggested the US Federal Reserve (Fed) could remain on hold for an extended period.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "Key Moments\n- GBP/USD trades near 1.3670 in early European dealings, slipping below the 1.3700 area amid renewed US Dollar strength.\n- US Producer Price Index rose 3.0% YoY and 0.5% MoM in December, exceeding forecasts and supporting expectations for steady Fed policy.\n- The Bank of England is expected to hold its policy rate at 3.75%, after a narrow 5-4 vote to cut rates in December.\nDollar Demand Pressures GBP/USD\nThe GBP/USD pair is under pressure in early European trade on Monday, easing to around 1.3670 as demand for the US Dollar firms. The move comes as investors lean back toward the Greenback, weighing on the Pound Sterling below the 1.3700 level.\nSigns of political steadiness in the United States are seen lending support to the US currency against GBP. Market participants are now watching the release of the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index later on Monday for further direction.\nFed Chair Prospect Warsh Supports Stronger Dollar\nUS President Donald Trump stated on Friday that Kevin Warsh, who favors a smaller central bank balance sheet, would be his preferred choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. Market participants expect that Warsh could advocate maintaining a more restrained Fed balance sheet and keeping interest rates higher for an extended period. This perception is providing an additional tailwind for the US Dollar and acting as a drag on the GBP/USD pair.\nUS PPI Surprise Reinforces Steady-Rate Expectations\nStronger-than-anticipated US producer price data is also underpinning the Dollar, as it reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve may keep rates unchanged. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that the US Producer Price Index increased 3.0% year-on-year in December, above the projected 2.7%.\nOn a month-on-month basis, PPI advanced 0.5% in December, outpacing both market expectations and the prior 0.2% reading. The firmer inflation metrics are seen supporting the case for the Fed to refrain from near-term easing, adding to USD resilience.\nBoE Outlook: Policy Pause Expected After Narrow Vote\nFor the Pound, the latest signals from the Bank of England are also in focus. In December, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to reduce the bank rate, marking the fourth quarter-point cut of 2025. However, most policymakers indicated that the pace of further reductions could moderate.\nLooking ahead, the BoE is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.75% on Thursday. Governor Andrew Bailey and his colleagues are seen maintaining flexibility in their policy stance as they assess future developments.\nBackground on Pound Sterling and Key Drivers\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the official currency of the United Kingdom and, according to 2022 data, is the fourth most traded currency in the global foreign exchange market, accounting for 12% of all transactions, or an average of $630 billion per day. Its major trading pairs include GBP/USD \u2013 widely known as \u201cCable\u201d \u2013 which represents 11% of FX activity, GBP/JPY, commonly referred to as the \u201cDragon,\u201d at 3%, and EUR/GBP at 2%. The currency is issued by the Bank of England.\nMonetary Policy and Its Impact on GBP\nThe primary driver of the Pound\u2019s valuation is the monetary policy set by the Bank of England. The BoE targets \u201cprice stability,\u201d defined as maintaining inflation around 2%. Its main policy tool is the adjustment of interest rates.\nWhen inflation runs too high, the BoE seeks to curb it by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for households and businesses. Higher rates generally support GBP, as they can increase the attractiveness of UK assets to international investors.\nConversely, when inflation is too low and points to slowing economic momentum, the BoE may lower interest rates to reduce borrowing costs, encouraging businesses to invest and support growth.\nRole of Economic Data and Trade Balance\nEconomic indicators play a significant role in shaping expectations for the Pound.

Expectations are being underpinned by persistent inflation pressure, with core inflation \u2014 the RBA\u2019s preferred trimmed-mean measure \u2014 rising to 3.4% YoY in the fourth quarter, well above the central bank\u2019s 2-3% target band.\nMeanwhile, a tight labour market, with the unemployment rate hovering around 4%, is further supporting the case for tighter monetary policy.\nOn the data front, figures released earlier in the day showed that Australia\u2019s TD-MI Inflation Gauge rose to 3.6% YoY in January, up from 3.5%. Attention also turned to China, a key driver for the Australian Dollar, as it is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. China\u2019s RatingDog Manufacturing PMI came in at 50.3 in January, matching expectations and edging up from 50.1 previously.\nIn the United States (US), the US Dollar is drawing support after the nomination of former Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Chair of the Fed, prompting investors to reassess the US monetary policy outlook. Warsh is widely viewed as an inflation hawk, leading markets to dial back expectations for aggressive rate cuts driven by political pressure.\nFurther support comes from upbeat US manufacturing data, with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rising to 52.6 in January from 47.9 in December, beating market expectations of 48.5. The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI also edged higher to 52.4 from 51.9.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, is trading near 97.63, its highest level in about a week.\nHowever, the Greenback could face near-term headwinds after the US entered a partial government shutdown on Saturday, as a midnight funding deadline passed without approval from the US Congress for the 2026 budget. As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the January employment report due on Friday will be delayed.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for AUD.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Feb 03, 2026 03:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.85%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Reserve Bank of Australia\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

Technically, strong support has been established at 55 4H EMA, suggesting that the recent consolidation from the 0.7093 should remain shallow and temporary.\nDecisive break above 0.7093 would confirm continuation of the broader uptrend from 0.5913 (2025 low).

                "body": "Asia stocks rally amid AI cheer; India surges on US trade deal, RBA hikes rates\nUSD/JPY rose to 154.98 on Monday, with the yen continuing to fall. Pressure on the currency increased after statements by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Over the weekend, the politician noted that a weak yen could be a significant advantage for export industries, indicating that Takaichi continues to favour a softer exchange rate. She later clarified that her comments concerned the need to build an economy resistant to currency fluctuations.\nOn Friday, the yen lost about 1% against the dollar after US President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chairman. The market regarded this choice as more \"hawkish\", supporting the dollar and adding to the pressure on the yen.\nAn additional factor of uncertainty remains the upcoming extraordinary vote in the lower house of parliament on 8 February. Takaichi\u2019s ruling party is expected to strengthen its position and advance expansive fiscal policies, increasing the risk of higher borrowing. Against this background, both\nJapanese government bonds and the yen were under pressure last month.\nExpectations of fiscal stimulus and discussion of tax breaks increase the burden on public finances and restrain demand for the national currency.\nTechnical Analysis\nOn the H4 chart, a corrective rebound follows after a sharp drop from the 158.50\u2013159.00 area. The price recovered from a low in the 152.00 zone and is testing the 155.50 area, but remains below medium-term resistance. The structure still looks corrective inside the broader downward phase until the quotes settle above 156.50\u2013157.00.The H1 chart shows that after a sharp decline, the pair entered a recovery phase and has been sequentially updating local maxima. The price climbed above the 153.26\u2013153.88 zone and is trading along the upper end of the Bollinger Bands, indicating continued near-term momentum. A\nslowdown is observed near the 155.50\u2013155.60 level, with a possible pause or pullback within the ongoing correction.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the USD/JPY rebound is primarily a technical correction within a broader bearish context for the yen. The move is exacerbated by political commentary favouring a weaker currency and reinforced by a hawkish Fed appointment. While near-term momentum persists, the pair faces significant resistance ahead. The fundamental backdrop of anticipated expansive fiscal policy in Japan continues to apply structural pressure on the yen, suggesting the current recovery may be limited in scope before the larger downtrend potentially resumes.\nBy RoboForex Analytical Department\n***\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

                "body": "USD/JPY starts the week on a firmer footing, trading near the 155.60 area on Monday and gaining around 0.55% on the day. The pair\u2019s advance reflects renewed selling pressure on the Japanese Yen, driven by diminishing expectations for further monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), alongside a modest recovery in the US Dollar.\nThe Yen remains under strain after the release of weaker-than-expected inflation data from Tokyo. The latest Consumer Price Index figures showed a notable slowdown, signaling that underlying price pressures are easing more quickly than previously anticipated. This development has reduced the sense of urgency for the BoJ to deliver another interest rate hike in the near term, reinforcing expectations that policymakers will proceed cautiously following their recent steps toward policy normalization. As a result, market pricing has shifted, with the likelihood of the next BoJ rate increase now pushed further out toward the spring.\nPolitical uncertainty in Japan is also weighing on the currency. Expansionary policy proposals from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, combined with uncertainty ahead of a snap general election scheduled for Sunday, have reignited concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook. Investors worry that a stronger mandate could pave the way for additional stimulus measures or tax cuts, potentially undermining fiscal discipline and adding further pressure on the Yen.\nThat said, the downside in the Japanese currency is not entirely unchecked. Persistent speculation about possible official intervention continues to act as a deterrent for aggressive Yen selling. Reports of unusual rate checks and repeated warnings from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance have kept traders cautious, helping to slow the pace of depreciation for now.\nMoreover, broader global risks\u2014including geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade uncertainties\u2014continue to sustain underlying demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Should risk sentiment deteriorate, these factors could eventually provide some support to the Yen.\nOn the US side, the Dollar has found modest backing from encouraging economic signals. In particular, the stronger-than-expected rebound in the ISM Manufacturing PMI released earlier in the session has reinforced confidence in the resilience of the US economy. This has allowed the Greenback to stabilize after recent softness, further supporting gains in USD/JPY.\nTrade Idea:\nBuy USD/JPY on dips toward 155.00, targeting 156.50, with a stop below 154.20, as long as BoJ tightening expectations remain subdued and US data stay supportive."

On January 30, news of Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination for Fed Chair sparked a round of short dollar covering that saw the U.S. dollar index (DXY) recoup nearly 50% of its losses. The market narrative is confused, as some camps believe Warsh will follow Trump\u2019s lead, lower rates, and devalue the dollar. Other analysts believe that resilient U.S. job openings and stronger-than-expected GDP data support a more prolonged pause in rate cuts.\nWhile dollar momentum remains uneven across pairs, its earlier defensive tone is fading, and any renewed risk aversion tied to geopolitics or weaker equity sentiment could lend short-term support. Overall, the greenback looks poised for consolidation in February ahead of a probable softening in Q2 once global rate cut momentum begins to align more clearly with Fed expectations.\nThe Canadian Dollar and Bank of Canada\nThe loonie rallied alongside the other G-10 majors as Japanese politics and concerns about BoJ/Fed intervention to support the yen fuelled yen sales against the G-7 major currencies. That wasn\u2019t all. Geopolitical tensions rose, and Trump\u2019s administration increased its hostility toward Canada.\nPrime Minister Mark Carney met with China President Xi Jinping, and both leaders agreed to lower tariffs to 2019 levels, at least on EVs and agricultural products. Trump said Carney was smart to do so, and then a week later he, and his minions, threatened dire consequences if Canada and China signed a trade deal.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s January meeting confirmed no change in its 2.25% policy rate, though the accompanying statement stressed \u201cgrowing caution\u201d around household debt and slowing global trade. Governor Macklem reiterated that while inflation has moderated, structural tightness in the labour market remains a concern. The USDCAD technicals are bearish and suggest a 1.3475\u20131.3775 trading range in February.\nOil Prices\nWTI oil prices climbed steadily through January, rising from the high 50s into the mid-60s by month end as markets faded early-month growth worries and leaned back into the geopolitical risk premium linked to Venezuela and ongoing Middle East tensions.\nTrump\u2019s hijacking of oil tankers carrying Venezuelan crude and his threats of military action against Iran underpinned prices. Those actions shifted the narrative away from \u201c2026 surplus\u201d toward \u201ctight but manageable\u201d balances, even as U.S. inventories remained comfortable.\nLooking into February, the WTI bias is modestly higher. A sustained break above 66.00 targets 70, while a move below 60 puts 55 in play.\nSources: Bloomberg, Investing.com, Reuters\nBank 2026-USD/CAD Q1 2026-USD/CAD Q2\nScotiabank* 1.3800 1.3500\nBMO 1.3700 1.3600\nCIBC 1.3800 1.3700\nTD Bank* 1.3800 1.3700\nNational Bank 1.3900 1.3700\n*Forecast is based on last month.

                "body": "USD/CAD rises as strong US PMI and falling Oil prices weigh on the Loonie\n- USD/CAD climbs as broad US Dollar strength and a sharp drop in Oil prices weigh on the Canadian Dollar.\n- US factory activity rebounds sharply, reinforcing support for the US Dollar.\n- Attention turns to labour market data from both sides of the border, with US Nonfarm Payrolls and Canada\u2019s employment report in focus.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) extends its losses against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, as renewed Greenback strength and falling Oil prices weigh on the commodity-linked Loonie. At the time of writing, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3676, up about 0.44% on the day.\nTraders also digested the latest manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) releases from both the United States (US) and Canada. In the US, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.6 in January from 47.9 in December, beating market expectations of 48.5.\nThe Employment Index improved to 48.1 in January from 44.9 previously. The New Orders Index jumped to 57.1 from 47.7, expanding for the first time since August and marking its strongest reading since February 2022. The Prices Paid Index rose to 59.0 in January, coming in below the 60.5 forecast but above the prior 58.5 reading.\nAt the same time, the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI edged higher to 52.4 from 51.9.\nThe upbeat data helped the Greenback extend its recovery, with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, trading near 97.62, its highest level in about a week.\nFurther support comes from a more hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) outlook after US President Donald Trump nominated former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May.\nInvestors view Kevin Warsh as a more institutional and policy-oriented choice than other contenders, reducing fears that monetary policy could be shaped by political pressure following Trump\u2019s repeated demands for lower rates.\nOn the Canadian side, the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4 in January from 48.6 previously, signalling a return to modest expansion.\nCommenting on the release, Paul Smith, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said that \u201cfollowing a challenging 2025, PMI data suggested that Canada\u2019s manufacturing sector started the new year on a more positive footing. Output stabilised after nearly a full year of continuous contraction, while confidence in the outlook improved and marginal jobs growth was recorded for the first time in 12 months.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the downside in the CAD is being reinforced by softer Oil prices, as Canada is one of the world\u2019s largest crude exporters. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading around $61.78 per barrel, down more than 5.5% on the day.\nAttention now shifts to labour market releases due on Friday, with both the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report and Canada\u2019s employment figures set to steer near-term price action.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quant"

Canada still lagged after ending 2025 among the weakest G10 performers and then ranking last in January. A key headwind is energy: Nymex crude slid roughly 21% in 2025 and, despite a January bounce, MUFG expects global oversupply to cap oil prices this year, limiting a classic support for the loonie. Add lingering tariff uncertainty and a murky int..\nerest-rate outlook, and the bank sees only limited upside versus peers in 2026.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Oil and rate spreads still do the heavy lifting.\nA softer US dollar helps, but MUFG\u2019s point is that Canada usually needs firm oil prices and a clear yield edge to keep up. If crude stays pressured by excess supply, energy-linked support for CAD could fade. And if the Bank of Canada holds steady while the Fed cuts, shifting yield differentials could keep USD/CAD from falling as much as the broader dollar does.\nThe bigger picture: Trade uncertainty adds a persistent discount.\nCurrencies don\u2019t need tariffs to react to tariff talk. When investors can\u2019t price trade rules with confidence, they typically demand a risk premium, which can weigh on CAD. MUFG flagged renewed US tariff threats tied to Canada\u2019s trade posture toward China, and that kind of stop-start policy noise can leave the loonie looking less predictable than its G10 peers.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "GBP/JPY flat lines below 213.00 as intervention fears benefit JPY; bears seem hesitant\n- GBP/JPY enters a bullish consolidation phase on Tuesday amid mixed fundamental cues.\n- Intervention fears lend some support to the JPY and act as a headwind for spot prices.\n- Fiscal concerns and political uncertainty cap the JPY upside and favor bullish traders.\nThe GBP/JPY cross is seen oscillating in a narrow band near a one-and-a-half-week top, touched during the Asian session this Tuesday, and currently trading around the 212.70-212.75 region, nearly unchanged for the day.\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said earlier today that she will continue to closely coordinate with US authorities as needed, based on a joint Japan and US statement issued in September last year, and respond appropriately. This revives fears about a possible joint US-Japan intervention to stem weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY), which, in turn, acts as a headwind for the GBP/JPY cross.\nMeanwhile, the Summary of Opinions from the Bank of Japan's January meeting showed on Monday that policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak JPY. This, in turn, highlights a hawkish view among the central bank's board members and backs the case for further policy tightening by the BoJ, which turns out to be another factor lending support to the JPY and caps the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe JPY bulls, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets amid concerns about Japan's fiscal health on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's reflationary policies. Apart from this, domestic political uncertainty ahead of the February 8 snap election contributes to capping the JPY, which, in turn, should act as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross and warrants some caution for bearish traders.\nInvestors might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the crucial Bank of England (BoE) policy meeting on Thursday. Given that traders are pricing in one or possibly two quarter-point rate interest cuts by the BoE in 2026, the central bank's policy outlook will influence the British Pound (GBP) and provide a fresh impetus to the GBP/JPY cross.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

Some funds kept buying earlier and are holding positions that are underwater.\nAlex Thorn@intangiblecoinsFeb 02, 2026BTC is trading below the U.S. ETFs avg cost basis after the 2nd & 3rd biggest outflow weeks ever (last week and week before)\n(and last week\u2019s outflow will increase after IBIT reports friday\u2019s numbers tomorrow)\nthis means the average bitcoin ETF purchase is underwater pic.twitter.com/XowzrnBaSM\nOutflows Pick Up\nOver the last two weeks, investors pulled close to $3 billion from the 11 spot ETFs, with one week seeing $1.50 billion leave and the prior week $1.30 billion, according to CoinGlass.\nThose moves suggest some market participants are locking in gains or cutting exposure after the recent run-up.\nAt the same time, cumulative ETF inflows remain materially lower than earlier peaks; buying has not fully come back even as some holders remain steady. Technical Signals And Bear Fears\nReports note that spot BTC is down roughly 40% from its October peak while ETF AUM has fallen by about 31%. That divergence has analysts warning that sustained weak demand could push Bitcoin into a deeper downtrend.\nTechnical charts show longer-term sell pressure building in certain measures. If demand fails to reappear, momentum could carry prices lower and extend selling across crypto markets. Policy, Politics, And Market Mood\nMarket watchers point to extra uncertainty around monetary policy and geopolitics as fuel for the recent moves. Reports have disclosed that the proposed US Clarity Act stalled in Washington.\nAt the same time, headlines about tensions in the Middle East and trade friction added to a rush for traditional safe havens like gold and the dollar.\nEven a hint of policy change matters: US President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for the next Fed chair was discussed by investors as another factor shaping expectations.Liquidity And The Road Ahead\nInstitutional holders have not all capitulated. Many have been described as holding on, which can cushion sharp drops.\nBut when the average cost basis for major ETF holders is above the current market price, confidence can be fragile.\nLiquidity has thinned in certain windows, and that makes price swings larger. A recovery requires renewed buying from both retail and big investors, otherwise sellers may dictate direction for longer.\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

Its stated goal is to acquire 5% of the entire supply of Ethereum tokens \u2014 some 6 million \u2014 and stake them to earn yield.\nThe firm has some big institutional investors, including Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, crypto exchange Kraken, and Galaxy Digital, among others.\nYet Bitmine is in a tough spot. Much of the 4.3 million Ethereum the firm owns was bought at an average price of $3,800 to $3,900 per token.\nThe second-largest crypto has dropped 53% from its $4,946 all-time high achieved in August.\nThe asset now trades at around $2,300, its lowest price since June.\nThe decline puts Bitmine\u2019s Ethereum trade in the running for the five biggest financial losses ever \u2014 if the firm were to sell.\nA lack of leverage\nDigital asset treasury firms like Bitmine have soared in popularity over the past year.\nYet as crypto prices fall, many of these firms are facing large paper losses after buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other assets close to their all-time highs.\nCrypto exchange Coinbase has previously warned that such firms \u2014 especially those that took on debt to buy crypto \u2014 could pose a systemic risk to the crypto industry.\nIn a February 2 investor update, Lee said Bitmine had acquired an additional 41,788 Ethereum tokens, and blamed weakness in the crypto market on a lack of leverage following the October 10 market crash and the Friday plunge in the precious metals market.\nHe reiterated that Bitmine views the pullback as an attractive buying opportunity given Ethereum\u2019s strengthening fundamentals.\nThose strengthening fundamentals are debated, however.\nCrypto security experts previously told DL News that Ethereum\u2019s increased network activity can mostly be attributed to a type of crypto scam that\u2019s become cheaper to conduct since the network\u2019s last upgrade in December.\nIndestructible?\nBitmine isn\u2019t the only crypto treasury firm feeling the pressure.\nFor the first time since 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen below the average buying price of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy, the largest Bitcoin treasury company that pioneered the trend.\nUnlike Bitmine, Strategy uses leverage to increase the amount of Bitcoin it can buy, which means the company could be forced to sell some of its Bitcoin if the price drops too low.\nSaylor has previously addressed these concerns.\n\u201cThe company\u2019s engineered to take an 80 to 90% draw down and keep on ticking,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox Business in November.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty indestructible.\u201d\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": "Key Points\nEthereum is currently trading 45% below its all-time high from August 2025.\nNew crypto market legislation could provide a boost for Ethereum, by stimulating faster institutional adoption.\nRapid advances in asset tokenization are likely to benefit Ethereum, which is still the clear DeFi leader.\nPopular cryptocurrency Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) may be trading significantly below its all-time high from August 2025, but there's good reason to think that it could be headed for a major breakout this year.\nWithin the next six months, Ethereum could soar to a price of $4,000 or higher. That's a blistering gain of almost 50% based on today's prices. Here's a closer look at the two powerful catalysts leading the way.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nRegulatory clarity\nIt's impossible to overstate how important regulatory clarity is for the crypto market. It's what leads to faster institutional adoption of crypto, and it's what leads to greater transaction activity on popular blockchain networks. In other words, if market participants know the rules of the road (even if they don't agree with them), it's a huge positive for the crypto market.\nThat's why I'm keeping my eye on one key piece of crypto legislation that is likely going to be signed into law this summer: the aptly named Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity Act). This new piece of legislation attempts to establish a clear regulatory framework for the crypto market. It will close existing loopholes, outline the roles of different regulators, define key concepts, and specify how digital assets can be traded.\nIf there's one cryptocurrency that's poised to benefit the most from this new crypto legislation, it's Ethereum. As a Layer 1 blockchain network, it's exposed to every nook and cranny of the blockchain world. And it plays an especially important role in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is one of the key areas affected by the Clarity Act.\nIn theory, passage of the Clarity Act should open the floodgates for more activity on the Ethereum blockchain. And it should make it much easier for financial institutions and big institutional investors to get involved in the crypto market.\nOverall, this new regulatory framework should be very bullish for Ethereum. I expect it to get the same type of lift that it did last summer, when Congress passed the Genius Act for stablecoins. That kicked off a remarkable summer rally for Ethereum that ended with it hitting a new all-time high of $4,954 in August.\nThe rise of asset tokenization\nEthereum is also at the forefront of an important new trend in the financial world known as real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. That's a mouthful, but it simply refers to transforming traditional financial assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be managed and traded on a blockchain.\nRight now, Ethereum is the clear leader when it comes to asset tokenization. No other blockchain comes close. So when big Wall Street institutions look to tokenize assets, they turn to Ethereum first. Case in point: when BlackRock(NYSE: BLK) launched its first-ever tokenized fund back in 2024, it chose Ethereum.\nAsset tokenization could be a boon for Ethereum. According to top consulting firms, it could be a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity by 2030. If Ethereum maintains its dominant role in DeFi, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which it does not benefit from the meteoric rise of asset tokenization.\nAccording to Wall Street strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, asset tokenization is the type of once-in-a-lifetime event that can forever change the global financial system. He compares it to the U.S. decision back in 1971 to go off the gold standard. That's how big a seismic shift asset tokenization could be. In fact, says Lee, it could lead to Ethereum skyrocketing in price to $62,000 or higher.\nHow high can Ethereum soar in 2026?\n"

Financial terms beyond the $35 million investment were not disclosed.\nThe investment comes as Jupiter has processed more than $1 trillion in trading volume over the past year and expanded beyond swap routing into perpetuals, lending and stablecoins, according to the company.\nThe deal also included warrants allowing ParaFi Capital to acquire additional tokens at higher prices, a structure the companies said was intended to reflect long-term alignment.\nThe investment follows a recent expansion of Jupiter\u2019s product offerings. In October, Jupiter rolled out a beta version of its onchain prediction market developed with Kalshi, followed in January by the launch of JupUSD, a Solana-native, dollar-pegged stablecoin built in partnership with Ethena Labs.\nJupiter\u2019s native token (JUP) was up around 9% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.\nDecentralized protocols attract VC attention\nIn 2025 and early 2026, venture firms have continued to deploy capital into decentralized protocols through token-based deals.\nIn October, a16z Crypto invested $50 million in Jito, a Solana-based liquid staking protocol, through a token-based deal that granted the firm an undisclosed allocation of Jito\u2019s native tokens at a discount.\nIn January, Babylon, a decentralized protocol focused on Bitcoin-native staking and lending, raised $15 million from a16z Crypto through the sale of its BABY token, with the firm saying the funding would support development of the protocol\u2019s onchain infrastructure.\nBeyond decentralized finance, venture investors have also supported other categories of decentralized protocols in recent months.\nIn September, decentralized science platform Bio Protocol raised $6.9 million from investors including Maelstrom Fund and Animoca Brands to support the development of its AI-native, blockchain-based framework for biomedical research.\nLast year, Humanity Protocol, a decentralized identity platform, raised $20 million from Pantera Capital and Jump Crypto at a reported $1.1 billion valuation to develop its Proof of Humanity onchain identity system based on biometric data."

Smaller stocks outperformed, with the Russell 2000 climbing more than 5% over the month.\nThis week, attention will stay centered on the fourth-quarter earnings season, while investors also look ahead to the U.S. monthly jobs report scheduled for February 6.

Economic data releases are also returning to a more normal rhythm after delays caused by last year\u2019s 43-day government shutdown.\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s latest meeting, markets are now pricing in no additional rate cuts until June, though a sharper-than-expected slowdown in hiring could quickly shift those expectations.\nMore mega-cap earnings and jobs data set to steer markets this week\nAfter a weak report from heavyweight Microsoft pressured major indexes, another wave of high-profile earnings \u2014 including results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2014 will put U.S. equities to the test in the days ahead.\nWith stocks now in the fourth year of a bull market, concerns around stretched valuations have grown, particularly among companies benefiting from enthusiasm over AI-driven growth.\nRoughly a quarter of the S&P 500 is due to report results this week, with solid U.S. profit growth continuing to underpin optimistic views for equities into 2026.\nInvestors will be watching closely for earnings and capital spending signals from Alphabet and Amazon, two key AI-focused hyperscalers.\nOther major names on the calendar include weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\nWhat analysts are saying about U.S. stocks\nMorgan Stanley: \"The sharp reversal last week in the S&P/gold ratio gives an early indication that confidence may be restored. Near-term, further upside may come from falling gold amid tighter liquidity considerations, while longer- term upside is likely driven by productivity gains on the back of a capex cycle. Consistent with this view, markets are rewarding high capex-to-sales firms and improving earnings momentum. Amid these dynamics, we see a rotation from commodity cyclicals back to consumer cyclicals in the near/intermediate term.\"\nEvercore ISI: \"For stocks, the selloff in Parabolic Gold and Silver \u2013 after frantic, meme-like trading \u2013 is not a material headwind, instead putting to rest fear of building systemic risk and turning focus back to equities. 4 year into the Bull market, stocks \u201cshould\u201d be more volatile.

                "body": "In this live blog, Investment Week collates all the breaking market news, analysis and opinion on equity, bond and currencies, as well as the impact of regulation, economics and key market figures.\nGold prices have steeply fallen to $4,655 per ounce, at time of reporting, after breaking through the $5,500 barrier only last week.\nAccording to data from MarketWatch, the precious metal hit a high of $5,626, but has dropped by close to 2% already today (2 February).\nSilver has also nosedived in price, going from over $120 on Thursday (29 January) to under $80 today.\nThe price of platinum has also sunk, by over $700, going from $2,770 on Thursday to $2,002 today.\nSusannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club, said: \"The precious metal plunge has continued with silver and gold hastening their sharp decline. The volatility is unnerving and is dampening investors\u2019 appetite to take risks.\"\nShe added that the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair has \"sparked this big reversal of safe-haven positions\" considering he is \"not expected to be a pushover\".\nShop price inflation increased to 1.5% year-on-year in January, higher than the three-month average of 0.9%, as high energy costs and the National Insurance hike continue to feed through into costs.\nAccording to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), non-food inflation increased to 0.3% year on year, against a decline of 0.6% in December.\nMeanwhile, food inflation grew to 3.9% from 3.3% last month, with fresh food and ambient food inflation increasing to 4.4% and 3.1%, respectively.\nMeat, fish and fruit were particularly affected, according to BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, reflecting weak supply and stronger demand, while non-food categories including furniture, flooring and health and beauty all saw an inflation spike.\nThis comes after the UK Consumer Prices Index rose unexpectedly last week to 3.4%, marking the first time in five months that inflation had risen.\nDickinson said thin margins and the rising costs of government policy are making it harder for businesses to keep prices down.\n\u201cGovernment must double down on costs in order to support households,\" she continued.\n\"A good place to look is the spiralling energy charges, especially non commodity levies, which are raising operating costs, squeezing margins and flowing through into retail prices.\u201d\nThe US dollar has dropped to its weakest level in four months, as safe haven precious metals continue to surge amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.\nAccording to data from MarketWatch, the US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, fell to a low of 96.95 today (26 January), its weakest value since September 2025.\nJohn Wyn-Evans, head of market analysis at Rathbones, said: \u201cThe dollar\u2019s weakness is testing the bottom of its trading range, reviving questions about whether long-term depreciation is accelerating.\u201d\nHe added that the recent surge in precious metals has been \u201cfar beyond what dollar softness alone would justify\u201d.\nHaving raced past $5,000 earlier today for the first time in the asset\u2019s history, gold has continued to climb, smashing through the $5,100 mark before falling slightly to around $5,070, at the time of reporting.\nSilver has also shot up, climbing 8.4% today and 54.7% since the start of the year. Over the past 12 months, silver has skyrocketed by 259%.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, explained that geopolitical factors such as \u201ca falling dollar, central bank buying and a surge of speculative interest from retail investors\u201d have caused precious metals to surge.\nHe continued: \u201cApart from geopolitics, a second driver of interest in gold has been a surge in Japanese bond yields on the back of heightened concerns about government debts in one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries.\u201d\nAt the time of reporting, 10-Year Japanese government bonds were trading at just below 2.25%, down slightly from their 52-week peak of"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in one of those dangerous-looking but secretly exciting phases \u2013 not a screaming melt-up, not a panic crash, but a tense, nervous drift where every candle feels like a test of conviction. German blue chips are moving in a choppy range, with bulls trying to defend higher zones while bears keep fading every spike. It is classic late-cycle price action: no clear breakdown yet, but every rally is being interrogated by macro fear.\nWe are not talking about clean trend days \u2013 this is sideways chop with a slight upside tilt, the kind of structure where algorithms and pros scalp while retail traders get whipsawed. The DAX is hovering in a broad band under its upper resistance and above a crucial support shelf, with intraday swings that force traders to pick a side: either you fade extremes or you wait for a real breakout. For now, Germany\u2019s flagship index is showing resilience but not dominance \u2013 bullish structure, fragile confidence.\nThe Story: What is actually driving this indecisive, jittery DAX mood in early 2026?\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 The Macro Puppet Master\nThe European Central Bank remains the main narrative driver. After the aggressive hiking cycle to crush inflation, the ECB has shifted to a more cautious, data-dependent stance. Inflation in the euro area has cooled compared to the peak crisis phase, but it is not at a fully comfortable level. That keeps the ECB stuck in a balancing act:\n- Cut too fast ? risk a new inflation flare-up, especially if energy spikes again.\n- Stay too tight ? strangle already weak German and European growth.\nCNBC Europe coverage is circling around exactly this theme: when does the ECB pivot from restrictive to truly supportive? Every hint from ECB members, every line from Christine Lagarde, feeds algos and traders. The DAX reacts instantly to perceived shifts between \u201chigher for longer\u201d fears and \u201csoft landing with gentle cuts\u201d optimism.\n2. Germany\u2019s Industrial Engine \u2013 Not Dead, But Coughing\nGermany\u2019s trademark industrial backbone \u2013 autos, machinery, chemicals \u2013 is still under pressure. Manufacturing data and PMI readings continue to flash weakness or stagnation rather than a booming recovery. Export demand is patchy, with global growth mixed and China no longer acting as the unshakeable demand monster it once was.\nGerman automakers (think VW, BMW, Mercedes-Benz) are in the middle of an expensive transition war: combustion vs EV, Europe vs China, legacy costs vs tech disruption. Markets like clear winners; the German car giants are still in the ring, but investors are unsure if margins will survive the transformation without bruises. That uncertainty weighs on the DAX whenever macro sentiment dips.\n3. Recession Fears vs. Soft-Landing Hope\nEvery DAX move right now is basically a referendum on recession risk. Economic headlines from CNBC and other outlets keep toggling between \u201ctechnical recession risk\u201d and \u201cstabilisation hopes\u201d. Germany flirted with stagnation, and although the worst-case energy shock scenario did not fully materialise, growth is fragile. That gives us:\n- Negative narrative: high rates, weak industry, geopolitical risk, and energy uncertainty.\n- Positive counter-narrative: inflation falling, supply chains normalised, and global tech strength spilling over into European risk assets.\nThe DAX 40 is sitting right between these two stories. It has not given up and crashed into despair, but it also has not broken into a euphoric, no-brainer bull market. That is why this zone feels like a trap for emotional traders and a playground for disciplined ones.\n4. Euro"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is starting this new trading week with a confident, green rally mood, but not a euphoric melt-up. Think cautious optimism: German blue chips are grinding higher, testing important resistance zones rather than exploding to fresh highs. Every intraday pullback is getting bought, yet you can feel traders constantly looking over their shoulders for the next macro headline. It is not a blow-off top, it is more a slow-motion squeeze as bears are forced to cover while big money still refuses to fully commit.\nThe index action looks like a textbook tug-of-war between dip buyers and cautious profit takers. Volatility spikes on data releases and central-bank comments, then fades into sideways chop. In other words: the market is acting bullish, but not fearless. That mix can be explosive \u2013 in both directions.\nThe Story: To understand the DAX 40 right now, you cannot just look at one chart. You have to zoom out and connect three storylines: the ECB, the German real economy, and the global risk cycle.\n1. ECB & Euro dynamics:\nThe European Central Bank is stuck in a high-stakes balancing act. Inflation momentum in the euro area has cooled compared to the peak, but sticky services prices and wage pressures keep the ECB from declaring victory. Markets are constantly debating the timing and speed of the next rate-cut cycle. Each new speech from Frankfurt is being dissected line by line.\nWhen traders sense that the ECB is leaning a bit more dovish, European equities, including the DAX, usually get a tailwind: lower expected rates mean easier financial conditions and support for heavily industrial, export-driven names. At the same time, the euro tends to weaken against the dollar during those dovish shifts. A softer euro is actually good for German exporters because their products become more competitively priced in global markets.\nBut here is the twist: if the euro drops too far or too fast, you import inflation via energy and commodities, especially in an economy still sensitive to gas and power costs. That is the knife edge Germany is walking. The DAX loves the idea of a gentle rate-cut path with a moderately weak euro. It absolutely hates the prospects of a renewed inflation wave that would force the ECB to keep rates high for longer.\n2. German macro: industry on life support or stealth comeback?\nGermany has been the problem child of Europe for several quarters. Manufacturing data has looked fragile, with factory orders and industrial production showing phases of stagnation or contraction. The once legendary export engine has been under heavy pressure from weaker global demand, China\u2019s slowdown, and the structural hit from the energy shock.\nBut markets do not trade the present; they trade the future. Recently, there have been subtle signs that the worst of the industrial downturn might be behind us. Business confidence surveys are not euphoric, but the collapse scenario has been avoided for now. The auto sector \u2013 heavyweights like VW, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 is still under attack from global EV competition and regulatory costs, yet investors are starting to price in that these giants will not disappear. Instead, they are pivoting hard into software, EVs, and premium pricing.\nThis is crucial for the DAX: if investors move from \u201crecession panic\u201d to \u201cslow but stable growth,\u201d the whole index can re-rate higher, even if the macro data is only mediocre. All it takes is the perception that the worst-case has been taken off the table.\n3. Global risk-on vs risk-off:\nThe DAX is not an island. When Wall Street goes into risk-on mode, tech and"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is stuck in a tense, emotional zone where every headline feels like a make-or-break moment. German blue chips are trading in a choppy range, with sharp intraday swings that scream uncertainty rather than clear direction. Instead of a clean breakout or brutal meltdown, we\u2019re seeing nervous, indecisive price action: failed rallies, fast dips, and constant profit taking as soon as the market dares to look optimistic.\nThis is classic late-cycle psychology: investors are torn between fear of a deeper European slowdown and fear of missing a rebound if the macro picture stabilizes. The DAX is not in a euphoric melt-up, but it is also not in a full-on capitulation crash. Think grinding, confusing environment where smart money hunts selective opportunities while retail traders get chopped up by noise.\nThe Story: To understand what\u2019s really driving the DAX right now, you have to strip it down to three big forces: the ECB, Germany\u2019s real economy, and global risk sentiment.\n1. ECB & Rate Path \u2013 The Monetary Overhang\nThe European Central Bank is the invisible hand under every DAX candle. After the aggressive hiking cycle to fight inflation, the debate has shifted to timing and speed of rate cuts. Inflation in the Eurozone has cooled from its peak, but services inflation and wage dynamics keep the ECB cautious. Markets want a clear pivot and a smoother path lower for borrowing costs; policymakers want to avoid reigniting price pressures.\nFor the DAX, this tension is critical. High rates squeeze heavily indebted firms and pressure valuations of growth names, but falling rates too quickly might signal deeper recession risk. Every ECB press conference, every offhand comment from Frankfurt, is moving expectations for German exporters, banks, and industrials. Financials are torn between margin tailwinds from higher yields and credit-risk fears if the economy deteriorates. Growth and tech-like names are hypersensitive to any hint of a future easing cycle.\n2. Germany\u2019s Macro Reality \u2013 Industrial Champion Under Pressure\nGermany\u2019s economy is still wrestling with structural challenges that pre-date the latest market moves. Manufacturing surveys have been stuck in pessimistic territory, and order books in key sectors like machinery and chemicals remain under pressure. Energy is not in full-blown crisis mode like at the height of the gas shock, but elevated input costs and uncertainty about long-term energy policy keep corporate investment tentative.\nAuto & Industrial Giants: The traditional backbone of the DAX \u2013 autos, industrials, and chemicals \u2013 faces a triple challenge:\n- Weak global demand from some regions\n- Fierce competition from U.S. and Asian players, especially in EVs\n- Ongoing cost pressure from wages, energy, and regulation\nYet, this same sector mix is also the opportunity. If global growth stabilizes, if China avoids a hard landing, and if supply chains continue to normalize, German exporters could pivot from \"pain trade\" to \"re-rating story\" surprisingly fast. That is why the index doesn\u2019t fully collapse: every time the news flow turns slightly less negative, dip-buyers step in.\n3. Global Risk Mood \u2013 DAX as a Leveraged EU Sentiment Proxy\nThe DAX has become a highly visible proxy for Europe\u2019s risk mood. When Wall Street catches a cold or geopolitical headlines spike, the DAX often reacts with outsized moves relative to the underlying fundamentals. Global asset allocators treat it as a liquid, high-beta way to express views on Europe.\nRight now, there is no single dominant narrative. Instead, markets a"

Twenty-two thousand entrants sent videos answering one question: Who do you watch \u201cSurvivor\u201d with? Now, on the other side of the planet, the winners and their friends and family stood slack-jawed on the deck of a forty-foot-long boat, heading toward Mana, one of Fiji\u2019s hundreds of islands. Fifty yards from shore, where three neon flags flapped above the surf, the boat went quiet. One of the winners, Tegwyth Alderson-Taber, a \u201cSurvivor\u201d micro-influencer from Long Island City, clasped her boyfriend\u2019s arm. The night before, they\u2019d decided that, if Jeff Probst, the host of \u201cSurvivor,\u201d agreed to officiate, they\u2019d marry right there on the island. \u201cHe\u2019s ordained,\u201d Alderson-Taber said. \u201cWe checked.\u201d\nDean Zimmerman, a retired R. & D. guy from Ohio, grinned. He\u2019d long dreamed of being cast on \u201cSurvivor,\u201d going so far as to train for it using a Zoom \u201cSurvivor\u201d simulator. During one \u201cendurance challenge,\u201d his wife found him motionless at his laptop, a Jenga block clenched between his teeth. \u201cThere was drool on my desk,\u201d he recalled. Zimmerman hadn\u2019t won the CBS contest; he\u2019d done something more \u201cSurvivor\u201d-like; he\u2019d formed an alliance with Terrance Bacchus, a friend from church, who had won.\nBacchus, who runs a nonprofit in Cincinnati, looked at his wife and two daughters on deck. \u201cOur first vacation all together in fifteen years,\u201d he said, then deadpanned, \u201cAnd Dean.\u201d He\u2019d entered because, in 2017, his daughter Jasmine got a callback for the actual show, but the timing clashed with her freshman year at Brown. \u201cIt was painful as a father and fan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this makes it right.\u201d\nJesse Jensen, the show\u2019s longtime executive producer, an Australian, was waiting on the dock; he would function as a back-lot tour guide for the winners and their entourages, twenty-three people in all. Tall, with white stubble, he exuded the air of someone who ran away with the circus and found a stable career. That was essentially the original hiring philosophy of \u201cSurvivor.\u201d \u201cThe head of pyro is a guy I met at a Tokyo night club in the nineties,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cAnd he looks like the head of pyro.\u201d\nAn eager winner hit him with a question, right off the boat: \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the \u2018Survivor\u2019 font?\u201d\nJensen said,\u201cI\u2019ll have to get back to you.\u201d He led the group first to the art department, a tent sprawled across a dusty airstrip, containing two seasons\u2019 worth of ornate torture devices. Lettered blocks, spray-painted barges, and battered tribal flags evoked both a county fair and the Spanish Inquisition.\nA golf cart pulled up carrying another tall, stubbled Australian: Jensen\u2019s brother Zach, who co-leads the art department. \u201cHe got me a job as an extra in \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 so I got him a job on \u2018Survivor,\u2019 \u201d Jesse Jensen said. \u201cWe were Jedis in \u2018Attack of the Clones.\u2019 \u201d\nOn the ride to the next stop, in an open-topped truck, fans traded stories. \u201cWe watched all of \u2018Cagayan\u2019 in a day,\u201d Anna Veire, a twenty-three-year-old Iowa State grad, said, of her dorm floor.\n\u201cIt was like \u2018Survivor\u2019 school,\u201d Charlene Baes, the winner who\u2019d invited her, added.\nJake and Kaylee Ben-Ami, newlyweds from Brooklyn, met when they were remote colleagues at an H.R.-software company. They shared Wednesday nights watching \u201cSurvivor\u201d before they shared a Zip Code. \u201cI mailed Jake a \u2018Survivor\u2019 candle as a thank-you for being my onboarding buddy,\u201d Kaylee said.\nZimmerman listened, nodding. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you mark time by the show,\u201d he said. He explained how it had helped him when his wife was undergoing cancer treatments: \u201cThe weird thing about cancer is, people don\u2019t know what to say to you. But some knew I liked \u2018Survivor.\u2019 So they could ask about that.\u201d\nThe chatter thinned as the truck halted at Tribal Council, the show\u2019s main gathering spot. It was midday.

                "body": "Small changes are often the key to achieving greatness. The 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers already had a powerhouse lineup when they traded for Tommy Edman, known for his stellar glovework, to bolster their defense. Then Edman became a hitting machine in the playoffs, leading the team to a decisive series victory over the Mets en route to their World Series triumph.\nAston Martin took a similar approach with the new 2026 Vantage S, implementing subtle upgrades to elevate the already enthralling Vantage to a new level of driver engagement. The Vantage S isn't concerned with a stratospheric power output or setting blistering lap records, with Aston Martin's attention instead centered on precise changes to the chassis components to improve handling and provide more feedback. The winding mountain roads outside Los Angeles where we drove the Vantage S revealed a car that carves up corners with unwavering confidence and unbounded bravado.\nFor Sale Near You\nSee all results for new 2026 Aston Martin Vantage for sale near 23917\nAlthough Aston's focus was on handling improvements, the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 also got some attention. With a healthy 670 horsepower, the S variant produces 14 more ponies than the standard Vantage. The AMG-sourced engine's torque rating remains 590 pound-feet, all directed to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Aston Martin says the added muscle and adjustments to the launch control result in a 3.3-second sprint to 60 mph, a tenth better than before. But it should go even quicker, since a standard Vantage only needed 3.2 seconds to reach 60 mph in Car and Driver testing.\nBehind the wheel, the thumping eight-cylinder heart feels ferocious, ready to catapult the Vantage toward the next corner. Despite the presence of forced induction, the throttle response is immediate, and the power delivery feels surprisingly linear. The only thing better than the g-forces thrusting you back into the scalloped bucket seat is the thunderous engine note, an instant shot of auditory adrenaline.\nWhile the engine's plentiful power and fierce soundtrack are intoxicating, the engineers in Gaydon directed most of their attention to the chassis. The revised setup features new camber, toe, and caster settings, and the Bilstein adaptive dampers are retuned as well. Aston Martin also mounted the rear subframe directly to the body, replacing two rubber bushings found in the standard Vantage, for a stiffer overall structure. Still, Aston wanted balance, so it softened the transmission mounts by 10 percent to better manage powertrain movement by lessening the abruptness of vertical motions and reduced the rear spring rate for better low-speed ride quality.\nThe changes don't drastically alter the Vantage's personality, but they help this car feel incredibly responsive and agile. The steering is dialed in, with weight building progressively, clearly communicating how well the front end is gripping the pavement. The suspension glides over most bumps while minimizing body roll. As you throttle out of a corner, the rear end squats and loads up before rocketing forward, like Shohei Ohtani anticipating when to unleash his potent home-run swing.\nThe Vantage S flows through twisty sections with ease, but instead of dissecting the corners with clinical precision, it plays in them, romping around with boisterous delight. The Vantage seems to revel when you drive it hard, inviting you to carry more speed through the corner and get more aggressive with the accelerator as you exit. And while the Vantage is capable of heart-racing speeds, the carbon-ceramic brakes slow it down with authority and immediacy.\nThe visual changes are minimal but impactful. New carbon-fiber blades protrude from the hood vents, and not only do they look mean, but they also improve heat extraction from the engine bay. Aston Martin also fitted a decklid spoiler, and while it may look inconsequential, the automaker says it adds 97 pounds of downforce at"

                "body": "For nearly a decade, the unfinished Oceanwide Plaza complex in downtown Los Angeles has stood like a gargantuan, gleaming question mark: a three-tower, $1.2 billion project that stopped halfway to completion. Then it became something far worse.\nAfter construction halted in 2019 when the Beijing-based developer ran out of cash, the skeletal high-rises across from Crypto.com Arena became an open invitation to the streets. Taggers took on the challenge in 2024, covering the trio of skyscrapers from top to bottom in the colorful scrawl that gave it its current nickname: \u201cGraffiti Towers.\u201d They made their global debut at that year\u2019s Grammy Awards.\nRelated Stories\nTwo years later, the unsightly landmark has finally cleared a major legal blockade by reaching a bankruptcy exit deal with its creditors, opening the door for a sale.\nAccording to a Jan. 28 court filing, first reported by Bloomberg, lawyers for Oceanwide argue \u201ca prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\u201d\nIndeed, the Games offer a new sense of urgency and a potential hard timeline for a solution. With the world\u2019s attention heading to this city in just over two years, officials and civic boosters are suddenly wondering if the most glaring scar on the city skyline can actually be cleaned up before the Games.\nPart of the answer has spilled out into Los Angeles politics. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, billionaire developer Rick Caruso, whose development work and 2022 mayoral bid made him a familiar voice in local civic debates, publicly criticized city leadership for what he calls a failure to manage the Graffiti Tower situation.\nThat broadside put pressure on Mayor Karen Bass and the city, which in the days and weeks following the tagging orgy scrambled to respond.\nIn recent years, the Los Angeles City Council voted to strengthen fencing and increase police presence to deter trespassers, and at times pushed for private security and cleanup funds, though those efforts have often struggled to move from resolution to reality.\nThe XXXIV Olympiad looms large in these debates because the site\u2019s location \u2014 in the shadow of a major competition venue and expected visitor corridors \u2014 makes its derelict state especially conspicuous. Leaving a graffiti-covered complex dominating key sightlines through 2028 would be an embarrassment, not just for local residents but for the city\u2019s global brand.\nBut even with the bankruptcy deal clearing legal hurdles, the practical and financial obstacles to cleanup and completion are considerable. The graffiti itself is the easiest part of the problem to describe; removing it across dozens of floors without modern facades, while securing and repairing the underlying structure that has sat exposed and unfinished for years, is far harder.\nAny buyer willing to take on the site still faces millions in construction costs, ongoing maintenance, and the broader challenge of making it viable in a post-pandemic, high-cost market.\nCity leaders can leverage the Games to speed permitting, push for redevelopment incentives, or even help underwrite cosmetic improvements, yet all those steps depend on finding a developer capable of rehabilitating the project on a tight schedule.\nBass and her administration have responded intermittently over the past two years, largely framing the situation as a public safety and trespassing issue. When videos circulated showing people paragliding off the graffiti-tagged towers, the mayor warned publicly that \u201ctragedy will take place\u2026if that place is not boarded up quickly\u201d and said the city would erect new fencing \u2014 though noting it would take time and that the property owner should reimburse the city for costs.\nThere were also moves through the City Council to step into the cleanup process. In early 2024 the council approved roughly $4 million to beef up barriers, bolster security, and remov"

A weaker yen boosts Japanese exporters by making overseas profits worth more when translated back home. And election optimism signals policy continuity, which investors often interpret as ongoing fiscal support for growth. The flip side is that the same easy-policy vibe can weigh on the yen and Japanese government bonds, since looser conditions can keep real yields low and stoke concerns about larg..\ner deficits.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Stocks can cheer while the yen struggles.\nIf investors expect steady leadership and supportive policy, equities \u2013 especially exporters and other yen-sensitive firms \u2013 can benefit even as the currency slides. That split matters because it can reshape sector winners and losers, and it can also keep pressure on government bonds if markets demand more compensation for fiscal expansion.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s playbook is still support growth first.\nJapan has leaned on accommodative policy for decades, and the latest election backdrop reinforces that approach. It can help sustain risk-taking at home, but it also leaves Japan more exposed if global rates stay high \u2013 a weak yen raises import costs, and bond investors may push back if deficits look set to widen.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
