Gold buyers retain control at the start of a new month amid growing calls for another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) as early as next week.\nGold capitalizes on broad US Dollar weakness\nMarkets are now pricing in an 87% chance the Fed will cut by 25 basis points (bps) at its December monetary policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nWith a December Fed rate cut almost a done deal, the US Dollar (USD) keeps its bearish undertone intact, after having registered its worst week in four months, favoring the Gold price upside.\nConcerns over the Fed\u2019s leadership also remain a drag on the USD, as Gold optimists aim for the $4,300 threshold.\nLast week, Reuters reported that White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett emerged as the frontrunner to be the next Fed chair.\nMeanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was a good chance President Donald Trump would announce his pick before Christmas.\nIn the day ahead, all eyes will be on the US ISM Manufacturing PMI for November, which could provide fresh hints on the health of the economy, following a spate of dated economic releases. The headline Manufacturing PMI is set to edge lower to 48.6 last month after October\u2019s 48.7.\nDeepening contraction in the American manufacturing sector will likely cement a December Fed rate cut, exacerbating the Greenback\u2019s pain, while providing a fresh leg higher in the bright metal.\nLater this week, a host of US statistics, including the ADP Employment Change, ISM Services PMI, Unemployment Claims and the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, will fill in the recent data void and offer fresh directives on trading the USD and Gold heading into the Fed showdown next week.\nGold price technical analysis: Daily chart\nIn the daily chart, the 21-, 50-, 100- and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) all rise in bullish alignment with price above them, while the 21-day SMA at $4,095.07 offers nearby dynamic support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) prints at 65.97, reflecting firm upside momentum without venturing into overbought territory. Measured from the $4,381.17 high to the $3,885.84 low, the 78.6% retracement at $4,275.16 caps the immediate advance. A decisive close above it could extend the run.\nBias stays positive as the metal holds above its rising averages, with the 50-day SMA at $4,040.77 underpinning the trend. Holding above the 61.8% retracement at $4,191.95 indicates the prior bearish phase is losing strength. A failure to maintain that level would risk a deeper pullback, while a break higher would keep bulls in control toward the recent high.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country\u2019s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold "

                "body": "Japan\u2019s capital spending in the third quarter was 2.9% lower than expected, with forecasts pegging it at 5.9%. This divergence marks a performance shortfall against analysts\u2019 projections for the quarter.\nIn the world of foreign exchange, the EUR/USD pair surged to a five-day winning streak beyond 1.1600. On the other hand, GBP/USD experienced fluctuating movements, ending the week with notable gains, influenced by the weakening US Dollar.\nGold Prices Influence\nGold prices continue an upward trend, driven by dovish expectations about future Fed actions impacting the USD. Despite a slight decrease to start the week, gold\u2019s appeal stays supported as the dollar remains subdued.\nGlobally significant US data, such as ISM PMIs, ADP employment, and PCE inflation figures, are pending this week. These releases could potentially influence expectations for upcoming rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, with possible ramifications on market dynamics.\nRipple has been trading within a tight range between $2.15 and $2.30, over four days. This consistent trading range suggests a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish market sentiments for the cryptocurrency.\nThe US Dollar is under significant pressure, fueling moves in other currencies and gold. We are seeing growing market conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. For traders, this suggests that continuing to bet against the dollar using options on pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD could remain profitable.\nJapan\u2019s Economic Outlook\nJapan\u2019s weak capital spending figures, coming in at 2.9% against a 5.9% forecast, signal trouble for its economy. This makes it highly unlikely the Bank of Japan will consider raising interest rates in the near future. This backdrop supports derivative strategies that involve shorting the Japanese Yen, especially against currencies with central banks that are not as dovish.\nGold has broken above $4,200 an ounce, a direct result of the market anticipating lower interest rates. This trend is strong, and buying call options on gold futures or related ETFs offers a way to participate in further gains. The market sentiment from November, which rewarded those who followed the trend, seems to be continuing.\nThe main risk to these positions is this week\u2019s US economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures. We have to remember how markets reacted in late 2023 and 2024 when strong data forced a rapid repricing of Fed expectations. We should consider buying cheap put options as a hedge against a sudden reversal if the data comes in hotter than expected.\nTo put this in perspective, the market is betting on cuts even though the latest core PCE inflation reading for October 2025 was 2.8%, still well above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal. However, job growth has slowed to a 150,000 monthly pace from an average of over 250,000 earlier in the year, which is what gives the rate-cut narrative its strength. The coming data will either confirm this slowdown or force a painful unwind of current positions."

Human rights advocates have decried the attacks as extrajudicial killings that violate international law.\nThe US has also deployed a considerable military presence to the Caribbean region, including the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, other warships, thousands of troops and F-35 fighter jets.\n\u2018Drill, baby drill\u2019\nAs president, Trump has promised to significantly ramp up oil production, fulfilling a promise from his 2023 re-election campaign to \u201cdrill, baby drill\u201d.\nIn late November, the Trump administration announced new plans to drill for oil off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades.\nBy contrast, many of the island countries in the Caribbean region are calling on fossil-fuel dependent countries to transition to other sources of energy, as they struggle to respond to tropical storms and other disasters, which are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change."

Ministers have started a series of online meetings, two sources said.\nIf the peace deal fails, Russia could see its supply curbed further by sanctions.

Angola quit the group in 2024 over a disagreement about its production quotas."

                "body": "Ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied nations (OPEC+) are unlikely to make changes to their oil output strategy when they discuss production at an online ministerial meeting on Sunday.\nAfter years of slashing output to prop up prices, key members of the OPEC+ group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, surprised markets earlier this year by hiking production to levels very few had anticipated.\nAFP takes a look at OPEC+'s output policy in 2025 and what factors influenced the cartel's decisions:\n- How did OPEC+'s output policy fare this year? -\nSince April, eight OPEC+ key members (V8) -- comprising Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman -- have boosted production by around 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in total.\nFaced with growing competition, particularly from producers in the United States, but also Canada, Brazil and Guyana, the group has focused on hiking production in a bid to regain a larger share of the oil market.\nWhile OPEC+'s strategy has contributed to a supply glut that weighed on crude prices and effectively eroded some of the group's profits, experts say a mix of other factors offset them.\nIn recent months, the 12-day Iran-Israel war, the US sanctions on Russia's oil sector and China's build-up of strategic oil reserves have driven up demand for oil, stemming a sharp fall in prices.\nAccording to Kim Fustier, an analyst at HSBC, \"none of these (factors) could have been forecast on (the) 1st of January\", but thanks to them the OPEC+ output strategy \"has generally worked\".\n\"You could argue OPEC+ got slightly lucky,\" she told AFP.\n- Did Trump's return to the White House influence the group's decisions? -\nAccording to Francis Perrin, who heads research at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations (IRIS), Donald Trump's return as US president also influenced OPEC+'s series of output hikes this year.\n\"The Trump factor is absolutely essential\" in explaining the OPEC+ output increases, Perrin told AFP.\nShortly after taking office in January, Trump called on Riyadh to boost production to bring down oil prices.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter and the most influential member of OPEC+, has made the accommodation of US interests \"an important asset\" in its diplomacy with Washington, said Perrin.\nTrump, in turn, has also agreed to several requests from Riyadh during a recent visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the United States.\nFor example, the two countries ratified a joint declaration on civil nuclear energy and signed an agreement providing Saudi Arabia access to advanced American-made AI systems, according to Washington.\nThe price of a barrel of Brent, the global benchmark for crude, is hovering around $60-$65, which suits Trump, Perrin said.\nWhile the price is relatively low, it is high enough for US producers to be profitable and maintain current production levels.\n- Why is there no further production hike in Q1? -\nAfter a final increase in quotas in December, the V8 already warned last month that there would be a pause in production adjustments in the first quarter of 2026, citing weaker seasonal demand.\nFor that reason, \"we don't expect much to come out of this meeting\" this time, said Fustier.\n\"OPEC+ is not going to want to get ahead of\" any outcome of the ongoing negotiations on the war in Ukraine.\nAn easing of tensions in the war between Russia and Ukraine would reduce the geopolitical risk premium that is driving up crude prices, while a deadlock in the negotiations would shift the focus of producers back to US sanctions against Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft.\npml-kym/rl/kjm"

                "body": "EUR/USD flirts with 200-day SMA hurdle, above 1.1600 amid a broadly weaker USD\n- EUR/USD kicks off the new week on a positive note amid the prevalent USD selling.\n- Bets for another Fed rate cut move in December continue to undermine the buck.\n- Relatively hawkish ECB expectations benefit the EUR and also support spot prices.\nThe EUR/USD pair regains positive traction at the start of a new week and climbs back above the 1.1600 round figure during the Asian session. Bulls now await a move beyond a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) before placing fresh bets and positioning for an extension of a one-week-old uptrend amid the prevalent US Dollar (USD) selling bias.\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near a two-week low on the back of dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, traders ramped up their bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs again in December in the wake of the recent comments from several Fed officials. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment around the financial markets, is seen undermining the safe-haven buck and acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair.\nThe shared currency, on the other hand, continues to draw support from the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates. In fact, the latest ECB meeting minutes released on Friday showed unanimous backing for leaving all three key policy rates unchanged in October. Moreover, the Governing Council described the policy stance as being in a good place. Traders have now almost fully priced out any additional rate cut in 2025and see around a 40% chance of a move by the end of 2026.\nThis, in turn, lends additional support to the EUR/USD pair and backs the case for a further appreciating move in the near term. A sustained break through the very important 200-day SMA will reaffirm the constructive outlook and pave the way for further gains. Traders now look forward to this week's important US macro data, scheduled at the beginning of a new month, starting with the ISM Manufacturing PMI later today. In the meantime, the final Eurozone PMIs might provide some impetus to the EUR/USD pair.\nUS Dollar Price Last 7 Days\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies last 7 days. US Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - EURUSD=X Consolidates Near 1.1600 as Fed Cut Bets Strengthen and ECB Holds Rates Steady\nWith the Fed tilting dovish and the ECB maintaining a cautious hold, narrowing yield spreads, falling DXY, and stable euro inflation position EUR/USD for a potential breakout toward 1.18\u20131.20 in early 2026 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Consolidates at 1.1600 as Market Awaits December Fed and ECB Decisions Amid Diverging Policy Paths\nThe EUR/USD pair ended the week near 1.1600, extending its consolidation phase for the fourth consecutive week. Despite volatility across risk assets, the pair has remained confined between 1.1400 and 1.1720, reflecting a tactical balance between a dovish Federal Reserve and a cautious European Central Bank. The euro strengthened modestly early in the week as Eurostat\u2019s flash CPI came in slightly above expectations at 2.2% year-on-year, up from 2.1% in October, while core inflation ticked up to 2.5%. However, with headline inflation hovering close to the ECB\u2019s 2% target, policymakers signaled no urgency for further tightening, anchoring the EUR/USD around its medium-term equilibrium zone.\nMonetary Divergence: Fed\u2019s Dovish Tilt Versus ECB\u2019s Steady Hand\nThe central dynamic driving EUR/USD (EUR/USD=X) remains the divergence in monetary expectations. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is now widely expected to cut rates in December, with market-implied odds at 87%, up from 61% two weeks earlier. Comments by New York Fed President John Williams and Governor Christopher Waller have reinforced this sentiment, both emphasizing that the Fed can ease policy without jeopardizing its inflation goals. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield has slipped to 4.02%, and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) retreated toward 99.70, its lowest level since July, creating short-term downside pressure on the greenback.\nConversely, the ECB is signaling a policy hold. Chief Economist Philip Lane and Executive Board member Cipollone reiterated that the eurozone economy, though stabilizing, remains too fragile for premature easing. The bloc\u2019s latest PMI composite remained below expansionary territory at 49.8, indicating stagnation, while GDP growth for Q3 stood flat at 0.0% quarter-on-quarter. Retail activity, however, showed modest resilience, up 0.3% month-over-month, suggesting consumer spending is stabilizing as real wages recover.\nTechnical Configuration: Bullish Flag and Critical Price Barriers for EUR/USD\nThe technical structure of EUR/USD shows a well-formed bullish flag pattern, with a base near 1.1500 and upper resistance around 1.1720. The pair remains above both its 50-week EMA (1.1475) and 100-week EMA (1.1380), maintaining a long-term uptrend bias. Momentum indicators, including RSI near 55 and MACD trending flat, suggest consolidation before the next directional impulse. A breakout above 1.1720 would target 1.1800, while a close below 1.1400 would expose 1.1100, where the 200-week moving average provides historical support.\nThis chart configuration reflects a market preparing for a policy-driven breakout in December. Should the Fed confirm its rate cut, EUR/USD could pierce 1.1750\u20131.1800, establishing a new 6-month high. Conversely, a hawkish hold by the Fed could trigger profit-taking, pushing the pair back toward 1.1350\u20131.1400.\nMacro Drivers: Inflation Stability, Energy Disinflation, and Trade Flows\nEurope\u2019s inflation narrative is stabilizing as energy prices decline. Brent crude (BZ=F) has slipped from $81.40 to $77.30 per barrel, reducing imported inflationary pressure. In parallel, natural gas prices in Europe have fallen 14% since October, lowering industrial costs and easing headline CPI. The eurozone trade surplus widened to \u20ac18.6 billion, supported by recovering exports to Asia and weaker import volumes. Meanwhile, the U.S. reported a 2.7% PPI, suggesting producer prices are no longer accelerating \u2014 another reason for markets to anticipate a dovish Fed shift.\nThe interest-rate differential between 2-year"

On the one hand, it is largely expected that the European Central Bank (ECB) will maintain interest rates unchanged as inflation remains near the 2% target.\nAt the same time, it is unclear what the Federal Reserve will do in the next meeting. While odds of a cut have soared on Polymarket, whether the bank cuts or holds steady will depend on just two officials, including Jerome Powell.\nThe EUR/USD pair will react to several important catalysts this week. The first one will come out on Monday, when Eurostat publishes the flash inflation report for November. Estimates are that the headline CPI rose from 2.1% in October to 2.2% in November.\nCore inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is expected to come in at 2.5% from the previous 2.4%. These numbers, while higher than ECB\u2019s 2.0%, will likely not change it mind to pause.\nThe other top numbers to watch from Europe will be the manufacturing and services PMIs, GDP, and retail sales data. A few ECB officials like Philip Lane and Cipollone will talk.\nOn the other hand, the US will publish some notable numbers, including the September PCE inflation data and initial jobless.\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis\nThe weekly chart shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate has been in a tight range in the past few months. It has remained above the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool.\nThe pair has slowly formed a bullish flag pattern, which is a common continuation sign. This pattern is made up of a vertical line and a descending channel. It is also slightly above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages.\nTherefore, the pair will likely have a bullish breakout in the near term. Such a move will push it to the ultimate resistance level of the Murrey Math Lines tool at 1.1720. A drop below the lower side of the flag will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nReady to trade our weekly forecast? We\u2019ve shortlisted the best European brokers in the industry for you"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Sterling Rallies to 1.33 Against Dollar as Rate Cut Bets Dominate Pairs Outlook\nGBP/USD strengthens above 1.32 for the first time in months as traders price dual rate cuts from the Fed and BoE | That's TradingNEWS\nGbp/Usd Price Surges As Dollar Weakens And Uk Policy Boosts Market Confidence\nThe GBP/USD pair climbed toward 1.33, marking its strongest weekly close in several months. The advance was driven by a softer U.S. dollar, falling Treasury yields, and stronger sentiment following the UK Autumn Budget. Investors remain alert to the coming policy decisions from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE), which could reshape the currency landscape as the year ends.\nU.S. Dollar Decline Pushes Gbp/Usd Higher\nThe U.S. dollar (USD) continued to weaken after lackluster macroeconomic data and dovish comments from the Federal Reserve. Futures markets now price an 87% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, up from 40% the previous week. As the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4.1%, investors reduced dollar exposure, allowing GBP/USD (FX:GBPUSD) to break decisively above 1.3200, a level that previously limited gains. The move reflected a broader global rotation into risk assets as traders anticipate multiple Fed cuts through 2026, eroding the dollar\u2019s rate advantage.\nUk Fiscal Policy Provides Short-Term Support For The Pound\nThe UK Autumn Budget presented by Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave the pound a significant short-term lift. The government introduced a fiscal buffer worth \u00a322 billion, calming gilt markets and easing concerns over fiscal discipline. 10-year gilt yields fell by around 15 basis points, supporting GBP/USD as traders welcomed the absence of new tax hikes. However, analysts caution that the benefits could fade since most tax revenue gains are backloaded until after 2029, leaving structural weaknesses in productivity and investment unresolved.\nBank Of England Signals Dovish Turn Amid Cooling Inflation\nThe BoE faces growing pressure to ease policy as inflation slows and household demand weakens. Markets now price a 70% probability of a rate cut in December, following a steady decline in inflation toward 3.8%. Governor Andrew Bailey stated that disinflation progress remains on track, with wage growth moderating and consumer data pointing to weaker momentum. The narrowing rate differential between the GBP and USD is now a key factor supporting GBP/USD, though stagnant UK GDP growth of around 0.2% quarterly continues to weigh on confidence.\nTechnical Structure: Cable Approaches Resistance At 1.33\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD remains in an uptrend but is approaching major resistance near 1.3330. The pair trades comfortably above the 50-day (1.3140) and 100-day (1.3080) moving averages, confirming bullish control. A breakout above 1.3330 would expose the next resistance at 1.3370, while strong support lies around 1.3080. The RSI reading near 59 shows slight overextension, suggesting possible consolidation before another move higher.\nU.S. Economic Data Will Drive Near-Term Volatility\nKey U.S. reports including the ISM Manufacturing and Services PMIs, ADP Employment, and JOLTS Job Openings will shape short-term direction. Weak readings could extend dollar losses and push GBP/USD toward 1.3350, while stronger data could prompt a correction toward 1.3120. In the UK, the Financial Stability Report and final Services PMI will influence market expectations for the BoE\u2019s December meeting.\nInstitutional Outlook: Split Projections On Gbp/Usd Trajectory\nMajor institutions remain divided on the pair\u2019s next move.\n-\nStandard Chartered projects GBP/USD rising to 1.34, supported by a December Fed rate cut.\n-\nRabobank expects a decline toward 1.30, citing slowing growth and weak productivity.\n-\nFX Empire highlights resistance near 1.337, aligning with Fibonacci retracement levels, but warns of exhaustion if price fails to close above 1.3330.\nSentiment And Positioning: Pound Short"

Spot prices currently trade just below mid-0.6500s, near a two-week top touched on Friday, and seem poised to build on the recent strong move up witnessed over the past week or so.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics' survey showed on Sunday that China's official Manufacturing PMI remained below the 50.0 mark, in the contraction territory, for the eighth month in November. Adding to this, China's Non-Manufacturing PMI fell from 50.1 in the previous month to 49.5, marking the lowest reading since December 2022 and the first contraction in nearly three years.\nThe immediate market reaction, however, turns out to be short-lived amid easing trade tensions and the recent government measures announced to boost consumption in the world's second-largest economy. This, along with diminishing odds for more policy easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), acts as a tailwind for the Aussie amid a weaker US Dollar (USD).\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near a two-week low amid the growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs again this month. Apart from this, the underlying bullish sentiment in the financial markets undermines the safe-haven buck and should benefit the riskier AUD/USD pair.\nEven from a technical perspective, Friday's breakout through the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) backs the case for a further near-term appreciating move. Traders, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and opt to wait for this week's important US macro releases, scheduled at the start of a new month, starting with the ISM Manufacturing PMI later today.\nEconomic Indicator\nNBS Non-Manufacturing PMI\nThe NBS Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP) and China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), is a leading indicator gauging business activity in China\u2019s non-manufacturing sector, namely services and construction.The data is derived from surveys of senior executives at services and construction companies. Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month and can anticipate changing trends in official data series such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), industrial production, employment and inflation. The index varies between 0 and 100, with levels of 50.0 signaling no change over the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates that the non-manufacturing economy is generally expanding, a bullish sign for the Renminbi (CNY). Meanwhile, a reading below 50 signals that activity among service providers and real-estate is generally declining, which is seen as bearish for CNY.\nRead more.Last release: Sun Nov 30, 2025 01:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nActual: 49.5\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 50.1\nChina Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) publishes the non-manufacturing PMI on a monthly basis.

                "body": "Ueda\u2019s hawkish shift weighs on USD/JPY\n- BOJ Governor Ueda says tariff risks fading\n- FX moves cited as more influential for inflation expectations\n- Swaps price 73% chance of December hike, two hikes by October 2026\n- JGB curve bear-flattens as short-dated yields surge\nSummary\nSpeaking in Nagoya, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda struck a hawkish tone, citing fading tariff risks, rising wages and FX sensitivity as reasons policy normalisation is warranted. Markets reacted sharply: swaps now price a 73% chance of a December hike, JGB yields bear-flattened and USD/JPY slid to multi-week lows, breaking its October uptrend. Technical signals point to weakening bullish momentum, making selling into strength and downside breaks more appealing.\nUeda Hawks Up (By His Standards)\nUeda\u2019s latest remarks carry a distinctly hawkish undertone, marking a shift from the caution that dominated earlier this year. One of the clearest signals is his acknowledgment that tariff-related risks, which were a major reason the BOJ paused its tightening cycle, are now receding. He noted that the feared impact of U.S. tariffs on global growth and corporate profits has not materialised, reducing a key external headwind that previously justified patience.\nEqually important is the emphasis on wages and their pass-through to prices. Ueda highlighted that the minimum wage rose more than 5% year-on-year for fiscal 2025, a development he believes will encourage broader wage hikes. This matters because the BOJ now sees wage-driven inflation filtering through to goods and services, reinforcing the case for normalisation. His comment that another rate hike would still leave policy \u201caccommodative\u201d underscores that the central bank views tightening as a gradual process, not a brake on growth.\nPerhaps most telling is the shift in how the BOJ frames exchange rate dynamics. Ueda warned that FX fluctuations are now more likely to affect prices than in the past, given the emerging cycle between wages and inflation. This linkage, combined with his reference to inflation expectations and continued increases in food prices, suggests the BOJ is increasingly sensitive to imported inflation risks. In short, the rhetoric points to a central bank that is preparing markets for further hikes while signalling that the era of ultra-dovish policy is fading.\nYet, despite laying out a raft of reasons why another move may be warranted, Ueda stopped short of explicitly endorsing a hike at the December meeting. Instead, he said the BOJ will examine economic activity, prices and market developments, and weigh the pros and cons of raising rates. That caveat leaves room for flexibility, but the overall tone suggests the bar for action is lower than it was just a few months ago.\nDecember BOJ Hike Gains Momentum\nMarkets have responded decisively to Ueda\u2019s remarks. Based on swaps pricing, traders now assign a 73% probability of a 25 basis point hike at the 19 December meeting, up from 57% late last week. By October next year, two hikes are priced in, with overnight rates expected to top 1%.\nSource: Bloomberg\nThat shift in expectations has driven a bear flattening of the JGB curve, with shorter-dated yields rising faster than longer tenors as higher policy rates dim the outlook for nominal growth further out. Two and five-year yields, in particular, have seen sizeable moves today.\nSource: TradingView\nThe adjustment in rate expectations has helped strengthen the yen, adding to the shifting directional risks outlined in my week-ahead analysis released over the weekend. With the BOJ now openly weighing the pros and cons of another hike and markets leaning heavily towards action, the balance of risks for USD/JPY continues to tilt lower, especially if U.S. yields fail to keep pace.\nWhile Ueda stopped short of explicitly endorsing a December hike, the question is why paint such a clear picture that policy normalisation is warranted. His speech came only days after another upside surprise in Tokyo\u2019s November infl"

Traders raise bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates again at the December policy meeting, which weighs on the US Dollar (USD) against the Japanese Yen (JPY). Later on Monday, the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda is set to speak. Also, the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report for November will be published.\nUS softer labor market data and dovish remarks from the Fed officials fueled expectations of a December rate cut. Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in nearly an 87% chance of a reduction at the conclusion of the Fed's December 9-10 meeting, up from 71% odds a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Fed officials will enter a quiet period ahead of the Fed meeting. Traders await the upcoming US economic data for fresh impetus.\nReuters reported on Thursday that the Japanese government plans to issue more new bonds to fund Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s economic package. Concerns over the supply of new government debt had pushed longer-dated government bond yields to their highest in more than two decades earlier this month. This, in turn, could undermine the Japanese Yen and create a tailwind for the pair.\nHawkish comments from some BoJ policymakers, including Junko Koeda and Kazuyuki Masu, increase expectations of a BoJ rate hike in December, which might help limit the JPY\u2019s losses. However, BoJ\u2019s Ueda speech will be closely monitored on Monday, as it might offer some hints about a rate hike at the BoJ's December meeting.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

Strong Japanese retail sales and sticky Tokyo inflation numbers fueled speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike, boosting demand for the yen.\nRising expectations of a BoJ rate hike have clashed with bets on a December Fed rate cut, increasing the risk of a yen carry trade unwind, potentially sending USD/JPY sharply lower. In my view, the prospect of a narrowing US-Japan rate differential sets the stage for a drop toward 140 through December.\nOn Monday, December 1, Japanese economic indicators and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda will set the tone for another pivotal week as the BoJ\u2019s December interest rate decision fast approaches.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nJapanese capital spending rose 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, down from 7.6% in the previous quarter. Capital spending trends provide insights into business sentiment, the economic outlook, and labor market trends.\nTypically, softer spending would suggest a weaker economic outlook, job cuts, and falling wages. These scenarios favor a more dovish BoJ policy stance. However, last week\u2019s data, including October\u2019s retail sales and November inflation numbers for Tokyo, signaled a pickup in demand and sticky national inflation.\nStrong domestic consumption and sticky inflation support a more hawkish BoJ rate path, discounting Q3 data. The USD/JPY reaction to last week\u2019s data and the capital spending figures aligned with my view that markets are focused more on the Q4 numbers, key for the BoJ\u2019s upcoming policy decision.\nLooking at the USD/JPY pair\u2019s five-minute chart, USD/JPY briefly climbed to a post-data release high of 156.584 before sliding to a low of 156.094 on Friday, November 28. Price action aligned with increasing speculation about a December BoJ rate hike. Meanwhile, USD/JPY dropped from 156.128 to 155.808 in morning trading on December 1.\nLater this morning, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda could greenlight a December hike, potentially kick-starting a USD/JPY bearish-trend reversal.\nUSD/JPY has soared 5.63% in the fourth quarter, fueled by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus policies. Previously fading bets on a December rate cut contributed to the fourth quarter rally.\nHowever, growing concerns about the weaker yen pushing import prices higher and eroding Japanese households\u2019 purchasing power have added to the chances of a BoJ hike.\nI expect USD/JPY to drop sharply if Governor Ueda focuses on elevated import prices while talking optimistically about wage growth. Markets would likely view such comments as a green light for a rate hike at the December meeting.\nEconomists continue to flag the weaker yen as a BoJ focal point, aligning with my bearish stance on USD/JPY.\nEast Asia Econ commented on October\u2019s national inflation figures, stating:\n\u201cHeadline SPPI inflation was stable in October, but weak for high labor-intensive sectors, while part-time wages were strong, likely on the back of the minimum wage hike. That\u2019s an unclear picture. But right now, with JPY so weak, the BoJ will focus more on headline CPI than these messy details.\u201d\nWhile BoJ Governor Ueda will take center stage in the Asian session, US data and Fed speakers are in focus later on Monday.\nEconomists forecast the ISM Manufacturing PMI to fall from 48.7 in October to 48.6 in November. A more marked contraction across the manufacturing sector and softer prices would raise expectations of a December Fed rate cut.\nNovember\u2019s data will come ahead of a Fed Chair Powell speech after the market close on Monday, December 1.\nPowell\u2019s support for a December rate cut, coupled with a hawkish BoJ Governor, would likely send USD/JPY toward 150, setting up a sharper fall to 140 later in the month.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December cut jumped from 39.1% "

At the same time, pricing for Fed easing over the next year continues to build, with traders now favouring four 25-point reductions, up from three just a few weeks ago. As we\u2019ve seen with other currencies like the New Zealand dollar recently, when markets sense a central bank has reached a turning point for policy, it can trigger immediate and often powerful moves. We may have seen the start of one last week, with a strong Canadian GDP report helping complete a notable bearish reversal pattern on the weekly timeframe, pointing to the potential for further downside as we enter December.\nCanadian Data Perks Up\nFor the first time in quite a while, Canadian economic data is starting to impress relative to expectations, deviating from the trend seen over much of the second half of the year. That can be seen in the graphic below tracking Citi\u2019s economic surprise index for Canada (red line) and the United States (blue line) over 2025. For those unfamiliar, the index measures how economic data prints relative to consensus forecasts, with greater weight on recent releases to help identify trends. Readings above zero suggest more data is beating expectations than missing, with the distance from zero indicating the scale of aggregate beats.\nSource: LSEG\nIn Canada\u2019s case, at 30.7, the beat rate is now the highest level since late August, recovering after a prolonged period of disappointment earlier in the year. While the U.S. also continues to see net beats, the signal is clouded by the timing of the government shutdown, which has limited hard data flow in recent weeks, with what\u2019s been released often severely dated.\nBoC Rate Cut Pricing Dwindles\nThe shifts in data have influenced market pricing for what the Fed and BoC are expected to do with interest rates over the next year. As shown in the graphic on the left, implied pricing from swaps markets favours four 25-point reductions to the Fed funds rate by the end of next year. In contrast, while a residual risk of another cut remains priced in Canada, the collective market expects the BoC has likely concluded its easing cycle with an overnight rate of 2.25%.\nSource: Bloomberg\nWith inflation in Canada well above the BoC\u2019s 2% annual target and activity data starting to pick up, it has sown the seeds for the BoC to potentially call time on the easing cycle when it announces its final monetary policy decision of the year on December 10. When it last met in late October, the bank\u2019s guidance was ultra-cautious, suggesting the Canadian economy faced a \u201cdifficult transition\u201d due to trade tensions with the United States.\n\u201cIf inflation and economic activity evolve broadly in line with the October projection, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIf the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond.

It feels very similar to the setup before the Reserve Bank of New Zealand effectively called time on its easing cycle last week, resulting in a bullish breakout in NZD/USD.\nWhile a similar response from the BoC looks likely, the rate decision is still more than a week away, leaving a window for other data to alter that "

                "body": "Tracking Forex pairs: what GBP/JPY can tell us about the global economy\nImage: Supplied\nEven in South Africa, GBP/JPY is a common choice among active traders, largely because of its strong price movements and liquidity. Yes, there are other, perhaps safer options like gold and USD/ZAR, but GBP/JPY stands out for those looking for faster-paced opportunities.\nNot only this, but GBP/JPY can actually inform trading strategies across multiple markets, mainly because of what it tells us about the global economy. So what does it tell us, and how can you use that information to your advantage?\nWhat GBP/JPY Can Tell Us About the Global Economy\nPut simply, GBP/JPY tells us exactly how global investors are feeling about risk at any given moment. Looking at the GBPJPY live price on Exness right now, for instance, you can see whether traders are leaning towards risk-on or risk-off sentiment.\nIf the pair is climbing steadily, it indicates growing confidence in riskier assets \u2013 often reflecting optimism about the UK economy or broader global growth \u2013 and if there\u2019s a sharp decline, that indicates investors are moving into safer havens like the Japanese yen \u2013 often reflecting uncertainty or caution in global markets.\nThe reason this is the case is because of the unique economic roles and investors\u2019 perceptions attached to both currencies in the pair. The British pound is widely considered a risk-sensitive currency: it tends to appreciate when investors feel confident about economic growth or higher interest rates.\nThe Japanese yen, on the other hand, has earned a reputation as a safe-haven currency: it tends to remain stable or even strengthen during periods of global uncertainty or market stress.\nEssentially, when investors are optimistic, they move capital into riskier assets, including the pound, seeking higher returns, which ultimately push GBP/JPY higher. On the other hand, during periods of global uncertainty, investors flock to safety, buying yen and selling pounds, which drives the pair down.\nIn this way, upward movements reflect risk-on sentiment and global confidence, while downward movements signal risk-off and a flight to safety.\nHow to Use This Information Across Markets\nAs we mentioned before, tracking GBP/JPY isn\u2019t just useful for forex traders \u2013 it can provide meaningful insight for your entire portfolio across multiple asset classes.\nThe reason for this is simple: the currency pair acts as a real-time benchmark of global investor sentiment and economic health, and sentiment is a primary driver of asset prices worldwide. By knowing whether investors are risk-on or risk-off, then, you can make your decisions far more informed across equities, commodities, bonds, or any other currencies.\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, you\u2019re applying a 5 minute scalping strategy in crude oil on a platform such as Exness. Even though oil isn\u2019t a currency, its price is going to react strongly to shifts in global risk sentiment. If GBP/JPY is climbing steadily \u2013 signalling a risk-on environment \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easier to anticipate short-term bullish momentum in crude oil as traders move into riskier assets.\nConversely, if GBP/JPY suddenly drops sharply, it could indicate an imminent risk-off move, meaning crude oil prices might experience a rapid decline. By monitoring the forex pair alongside your scalping charts, you effectively gain an early warning system.\nBecause the pair reacts almost instantly to changes in global sentiment \u2013 often before other markets fully price in these shifts \u2013 you can adjust your entries and exits quickly, confirming the strength of trends and avoiding false signals without having to rely solely on price action in the commodity itself.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the only indicator. On the contrary, if you\u2019re only relying on GBP/JPY sentiment to make your scalping decisions, you risk being caught off guard by short-term noise or reversals. But if you use it alongside solid technical analysis and the best indicators \u2013 such as mo"

                "body": "BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Becomes Company\u2019s Most Profitable Product\nBlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has surprised everyone by becoming the world's largest asset manager's most profitable product line.\nThis achievement is remarkable given that BlackRock manages over 1,400 ETFs globally and controls more than $13.4 trillion in total assets.\nCristiano Castro, BlackRock\u2019s director of business development in Brazil, made this announcement at the Blockchain Conference in S\u00e3o Paulo. Castro called the development \u201ca big surprise\u201d and admitted they were optimistic when launching but \u201cdidn\u2019t expect this scale.\u201d\nRecord-Breaking Performance Numbers\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launched in January 2024 and quickly broke industry records. The fund reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 days, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history. Currently, IBIT holds $70.7 billion in net assets and has generated an estimated $245 million in annual fees by October 2025.\nThese numbers are impressive when compared to BlackRock\u2019s flagship products. By July 2025, the Bitcoin ETF was generating more revenue than BlackRock\u2019s S&P 500 tracker, despite being much smaller in total assets. This happens because IBIT charges a 0.25% annual fee, while traditional index funds charge much lower fees.\nSource: @BitcoinArchive\nThe fund attracted over $52 billion in net inflows during its first year, far outpacing all other ETFs launched in the last decade. IBIT now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply, making it a significant player in the cryptocurrency market.\nMajor Institutional Investors Join In\nHarvard University made headlines by investing heavily in BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. The prestigious university\u2019s endowment fund held $443 million worth of IBIT shares as of September 30, 2025, representing over 20% of its U.S. public equity holdings.\nHarvard\u2019s investment is particularly noteworthy because university endowments typically avoid ETFs, preferring private equity and real estate investments instead. The university tripled its Bitcoin ETF position in the third quarter of 2025, showing growing confidence in the product.\nEven BlackRock itself is betting on its Bitcoin ETF\u2019s success. The company\u2019s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT stake by 14%, demonstrating internal confidence in the fund\u2019s future growth.\nRevenue Comparison With Traditional Products\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF success shows how fee structures can create profitable products even with smaller asset bases. While the company\u2019s S&P 500 ETF manages about $624 billion in assets, it charges only 0.03% in fees. IBIT\u2019s higher 0.25% fee rate on its growing asset base generates more total revenue.\nThis pricing power reflects the unique costs of managing cryptocurrency products, including custody, insurance, and regulatory requirements. Investors have accepted these higher fees for convenient, regulated access to Bitcoin exposure.\nThe success also highlights how specialized ETF products can command premium pricing in new market categories, unlike traditional index funds that compete mainly on low costs.\nRecent Market Challenges and Recovery\nNovember 2025 brought significant challenges for IBIT, with the fund experiencing $2.34 billion in outflows during the month \u2013 the largest monthly outflows since the fund\u2019s January 2024 launch. The largest single-day withdrawals occurred on November 18 ($523 million) and November 14 ($463 million), coinciding with Bitcoin price volatility.\nHowever, Castro emphasized that these outflows represent normal market behavior for liquid ETF products. He explained that when assets experience price compression, retail investors typically adjust their positions, especially in volatile instruments like cryptocurrency funds.\nThe fund has since recovered as Bitcoin climbed back above $90,000. Investors now sit on cumulative gains of approximately $3.2 billion, reversing earlier losses when profits had dropped to just $630 million.\nMarket Impact an"

                "body": "NASDAQ proposes a major increase in position limits for Bitcoin ETF options, signalling maturing crypto markets and growing institutional participation.\nRegulatory clarity and updated SEC rules in 2025 are enabling exchanges to expand crypto-linked derivatives while maintaining investor protection.\nLarger position and exercise limits on IBIT options can boost liquidity, improve hedging, and accelerate institutional adoption.\nA major shift is taking place in the digital assets sector as NASDAQ steps forward with a proposal connected to Bitcoin exchange-traded products. The latest development involves a move by the NASDAQ International Securities Exchange to raise position and exercise limits for options linked to one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs. This action reflects growing demand, rising trading activity, and the increasing acceptance of crypto investment products within traditional financial markets.\nNASDAQ\u2019s proposal focuses on increasing position limits for options on iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The exchange has proposed raising the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. This is a very large jump and places Bitcoin ETF options in the same category as the biggest and most liquid equity ETFs.\nPosition limits are important because they prevent market manipulation and control excessive concentration. When these limits are raised, it signals that the underlying asset has matured enough to support larger trading volumes safely. If regulators approve this proposal, it may allow traders and institutions to hold much larger option positions linked to the Bitcoin ETF.\nThere are several reasons why this development stands out. The first is the strong growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs since they were approved. Trading volumes have been rising sharply, and investor interest has been far higher than early expectations. Exchanges are now trying to update their rules and systems to match this new level of activity.\nAnother important point is the recent regulatory changes by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has introduced clearer guidelines that make it easier for spot crypto ETFs to be listed under general standards. This has increased industry confidence and encouraged more issuers to enter the market. NASDAQ\u2019s proposal fits squarely into this changing environment, showing how exchanges are preparing for a more active and competitive crypto ETF space.\nExpanding position limits can have a strong effect on how smoothly a market operates. When traders and institutions are allowed to take larger positions, more market-makers and professional desks may step in. Their involvement can help tighten spreads, improve price discovery, and create deeper liquidity.\nFor Bitcoin ETF options, larger position limits could make the market more attractive to big institutional players who need the flexibility to hedge large portfolios. More efficient hedging and larger trading volumes usually make a market more stable over time. However, higher limits also require more careful monitoring because bigger positions can create higher risks during periods of extreme price swings. For this reason, NASDAQ\u2019s proposal also includes adjustments to exercise limits and trading rules to ensure proper oversight.\nAlso Read - Is Options Trading Behind Bitcoin\u2019s Volatility Spike?\nThe development comes at a time when regulatory supervision of crypto-linked financial products is undergoing significant changes. The SEC\u2019s updated rules have simplified the process for launching spot commodity ETFs, which include digital assets like Bitcoin. This has transferred more responsibility to exchanges to ensure investor protection, strong surveillance systems, and proper custody arrangements.\nNASDAQ\u2019s request to expand options limits falls under this new regulatory structure. Before it can move forward, the proposal will go through a public comment period and then be reviewed by regulators. The final approval will depend on whether the exchange can prove that "

The WFE contends that relaxing these rules could weaken investor protections and undermine the stability of financial markets by letting unregulated players sidestep established safeguards. In a letter addressed to the SEC's Crypto Task Force, the federation expressed concern that tokenized stocks\u2014digital representations of traditional equities\u2014are often promoted as equivalent to actual shares, despite lacking comparable legal rights and regulatory oversight, as highlighted by LookOnChain data.\nTokenized stocks, which use blockchain technology to mirror the value of publicly traded company shares, have become increasingly popular due to their promise of round-the-clock trading and quicker settlement times. Nevertheless, the WFE warns that these digital assets frequently do not provide essential investor rights, such as access to dividends, voting privileges, or robust custody arrangements. \"These imitation products fall short of the high standards investors expect,\" said WFE CEO Nandini Sukumar in a letter dated August 26 to the SEC. The federation stressed that regulatory exemptions should only be considered if they foster fair competition and serve the public interest, in line with the WFE\u2019s principles.\nThe SEC is currently considering a regulatory sandbox that would allow crypto companies to experiment with tokenized stocks under temporary exemptions, a strategy supported by SEC Chair Paul Atkins as a way to encourage innovation while retaining regulatory oversight. However, the WFE warns that this approach could create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, enabling crypto platforms to operate under less stringent rules than traditional exchanges. \"Both traditional exchanges and crypto platforms should compete under equal conditions,\" stated James Auliffe, who leads the WFE\u2019s Technology Working Group.\nThis debate comes as tokenized assets experience rapid expansion, with their global market value recently surpassing $2 billion. Critics, including securities law specialist Tim Fries, caution that without robust regulations, tokenized stocks could leave investors vulnerable to fraud, flaws in smart contracts, and limited avenues for resolving disputes. The WFE\u2019s concerns are echoed by global organizations such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which warned in November 2025 that tokenization can heighten risks related to data reliability and asset custody.\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing discussions are part of a larger international trend to find the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring effective oversight. While regions like the European Union, Hong Kong, and Singapore have introduced comprehensive digital asset regulations, the U.S. continues to rely on case-by-case exemptions. The WFE is calling for a harmonized global regulatory framework, urging the SEC to require clear disclosures, enforce redemption rights, and ensure that tokenized products specify whether they represent actual ownership or synthetic exposure, in accordance with the federation\u2019s recommendations.\nAs the SEC deliberates its next steps, the outcome could mark a turning point for capital markets. Supporters of tokenization believe it can broaden access and lower transaction costs, but emphasize that these benefits should not come at the expense of established investor protections. With growing consensus among major financial institutions and regulators against unregulated experimentation, the future of tokenized stocks may depend on carefully monitored pilot programs that integrate blockchain technology while preserving market confidence."

But when you strip out the hype and zoom into the fundamentals, three ecosystems stand out for very different reasons: Solana, Chainlink, and a newer entrant built around private-market access \u2013 IPO Genie.\nThis is a clash between three categories: A high-performance L1, a data-routing powerhouse, and a private-equity access layer for Web3.\nLet\u2019s break it down like an investor looking for asymmetric upside, not another speculative narrative.\nSolana: Speed Wins the Retail Crowd \u2013 But Does It Scale Into 2025?\nSolana is exactly what its fans say it is; a high-performance blockchain built for fast, affordable, globally accessible applications.\nIts pitch is simple:\n- Speed: 50,000+ TPS on-chain\n- Cost: Fractions of a cent per transaction\n- Global Access: Supports payments, gaming, DeFi, NFTs, social apps\nSolana\u2019s engineering is tight \u2013 a unique combination of Proof of History + high-throughput design that lets developers build consumer-grade apps without the clunkiness of older chains.\nBut Solana\u2019s real growth engine? A thriving culture of builders shipping quickly.\nSolana\u2019s 2025 Upside\n- Technology: Strong; continues leading the \u201cconsumer crypto\u201d category\n- Market Cap Potential: Still room to expand, but major upside already priced in\n- Future Catalyst: More mainstream apps adopting Solana rails\nSolana wins the \u201cbest crypto for user-facing apps,\u201d but its growth now behaves more like a large-cap tech stock than a breakout play.\nChainlink: The Invisible Giant Connecting Capital Markets to Blockchains\nIf Solana is the loud extrovert, Chainlink is the quiet operator running the global plumbing.\nChainlink is the industry-standard oracle network \u2013 the one that financial institutions actually use. It delivers the data that DeFi relies on, and it connects blockchains to legacy financial systems in a way no competitor has matched.\nWhy It Matters\nChainlink isn\u2019t just providing prices. It\u2019s enabling tokenization, automation, risk management, compliance workflows, and cross-chain interoperability \u2013 all through verifiable data and secure decentralized computation.\nIts network is trusted by major institutions like Swift, Euroclear, Mastercard, Fidelity International, UBS, ANZ, Aave, GMX, and Lido.\nThis is the infrastructure layer for on-chain capital markets.\nChainlink\u2019s 2025 Upside\n- Technology: Best-in-class oracle and interoperability stack\n- Market Cap Potential: Strong institutional backing supports multi-year growth\n- Future Catalyst: The full institutional tokenization wave\nChainlink is the \u201cbest crypto\u201d for investors who believe traditional finance is shifting on-chain \u2013 slowly but inevitably.\nIPO Genie: The New Category \u2013 Tokenized Private Equity for Everyday Investors\nNow for the wild card \u2013 and the one with the clearest asymmetric upside.\nIf Solana represents users, and Chainlink represents infrastructure\u2026\nIPO Genie represents access \u2013 Access to a world that\u2019s historically been locked behind closed doors.\nWhat It Is\nIPO Genie is positioning itself as Web3\u2019s Wall Street \u2013 a tokenized private-equity gateway that gives qualified investors early exposure to private deals before their public rounds, listings, or exits.\nIn simpler terms: It opens the door to the kind of deals that were once reserved for Sequoia, Berkshire Hathaway, and BlackRock.\nWhy IPO Genie Exists\nBecause the world runs on private deals.\nOver $3 trillion moves through private equity, pre-IPO startups, and high-yield private assets every year. But until now, retail and emerging investors had almost zero access.\nIPO Genie is changing that by sourcing and pre-vetting institutional-grade opportunities \u2013 complete with due diligence, risk controls, and AI specialist oversight.\nIt\u2019s not a casino token. It\u2019s a way to participate in deal flow that shapes global markets.\nGrowth Potential Breakdown: Technology + "

                "body": "Luke Judges, Ripple's Global Partner Success Lead and Director, recently addressed misconceptions about his past involvement with Solana. The executive clarified that joining Ripple does not mean abandoning respect for other blockchain ecosystems.\nJudges revealed his extensive history with Solana before his current role. He founded two startups within the Solana ecosystem. He also operated a validator node that managed over $30 million in staked assets. His experience spans the full market cycle, witnessing Solana's price collapse from $200 to $8 before its subsequent recovery.\nSolana's Strengths and Weaknesses\nJudges acknowledged that Solana faces ongoing challenges. The network currently experiences a declining validator count. This presents concerns about decentralization and network security.\nDespite these issues, Judges maintains that Solana offers valuable lessons. He specifically highlighted the network's pragmatic approach and execution speed. These qualities have enabled Solana to rapidly gain market share.\nThe executive suggested that XRP and other Layer 1 blockchains should study Solana's strategies. Learning from competitors strengthens the entire blockchain industry.\nJudges also noted Ethereum's response to competitive pressure. The Ethereum Foundation has sharpened its market strategy after losing ground to Solana. This demonstrates how competition drives innovation across blockchain platforms.\nThe Ripple lead stressed that XRP does not operate in isolation. The blockchain can adopt successful strategies from other networks while maintaining its unique advantages.\nXRP's Smart Contract Evolution\nThe timing of Judges' comments aligns with significant developments in the XRP ecosystem. XRP is actively exploring smart contract functionality and native staking capabilities.\nThese initiatives reflect changing market demands. The recent approval of XRP exchange-traded funds in the United States has intensified focus on the blockchain's technical capabilities.\nDavid Schwartz, Ripple's Chief Technology Officer and original XRP Ledger architect, confirmed evolving perspectives on network governance. His thinking about consensus models has shifted over time.\nSchwartz revealed ongoing considerations about XRP's role in decentralized finance. He examines both organic DeFi applications through platforms like Flare, MoreMarkets, Axelar, and Doppler, as well as native on-chain possibilities.\nThe CTO indicated that current market conditions favor discussions about enhanced DeFi features. Programmability initiatives are already underway within the XRP development community.\nSchwartz suggested the timing is appropriate to explore additional native DeFi capabilities for XRP Ledger. These conversations could reshape the blockchain's technical roadmap.\nRecent milestones support this direction. XRP Ledger Smart Contracts launched on AlphaNet, a dedicated development network. This marks a significant step toward programmable functionality.\nThe AlphaNet deployment allows developers to test smart contract features before mainnet implementation. This phased approach reduces risk while building developer confidence.\nAt the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.19, suggesting a 0.25% increase in the last 24 hours.\nXRP price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap"

                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI +0.61%) isn't doing quite as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite year to date, but it's still having a great year -- up 12.2% at the time of this writing. However, there are some key Dow components that have been drastically underperforming the index, including Salesforce (CRM +1.05%), which is down 31.0% in 2025. The only Dow stock to have a worse year so far is UnitedHealth Group.\nSalesforce has tumbled 14.9% since being added to the Dow on Aug. 31, 2020. During that same period, the Dow is up 66.5%, and the S&P 500 has nearly doubled.\nHere's why Salesforce has likely reached its bottom, and why investors should take a closer look at the software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for 2026.\nSalesforce's growth is slowing despite its push into agentic AI\nSalesforce is a textbook example of why even the most seemingly impenetrable moats are susceptible to disruption.\nSalesforce specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software, which is used by sales teams worldwide to manage customer accounts, maximize the conversion of prospects into actual sales, and more. Salesforce also owns cloud-based messaging platform, Slack, and data visualization giant, Tableau.\nThe company's suite of tools is embedded with many large enterprise clients, but SaaS companies like Salesforce have experienced mixed reactions from investors as a result of artificial intelligence (AI).\nWhile AI is leading to a surge in compute, networking, and infrastructure demand, the benefits aren't as clear-cut for software. The simplest reason for the dichotomy is that AI tools are really good at enhancing the capabilities of established ecosystems, which benefits companies that combine application software with infrastructure software.\nFor example, Microsoft's Dynamics 365 is a CRM platform that is arguably inferior to what Salesforce offers. However, when paired with Microsoft 365, Outlook, Teams, and Azure, the system becomes a well-oiled machine, avoiding the complications that come with integrating third-party solutions like Salesforce.\nSalesforce's approach to AI has been purposeful and logical. The company has been deploying AI agents through its autonomous AI platform, Agentforce. Data-powered agents can help Salesforce users sort through information, manage the sales funnel, and act on data to maximize conversions. Agentforce appears to be a catalyst for growth on paper, but the pricing model is based partially on add-ons per user. Here's where things get tricky.\nAt its core, the AI value proposition centers around doing more with less. Salesforce's business model is still based heavily on user quantity. A greater number of total users paired with Agentforce equals massive growth potential. However, agentic AI tools like Agentforce can also be a victim of their own success as an organization may not need to purchase as many licenses if they can accomplish more with Agentforce-powered solutions.\nUltimately, the numbers don't lie -- Salesforce's growth has been slowing over the past several years. The company is only guiding for about 9% revenue growth for fiscal 2026, which ends next January. If you tune into a Salesforce earnings call, like the fiscal third-quarter call that will occur on Dec. 3, you'll likely hear a lot of confident rhetoric on Salesforce being a leader in AI, but that hasn't borne out consistently in the company's financial results, at least not yet.\nTo be fair, Salesforce isn't alone. Adobe is another SaaS heavyweight that has seen its stock plunge despite gains for the broad market indexes. The SaaS business model thrives when user counts are growing and clients are willing to pay higher prices per subscription. AI is challenging that model by empowering users to do more with less, and so far, Salesforce doesn't have a clear solution to offset slowing growth.\nNYSE: CRM\nKey Data Points\nSalesforce is still an excellent business\nSalesforce faces an uphill climb, but it's a mistake to complet"

[6]\nAt the same time, the pullback over the month is a reminder that UK stocks are still trading just below record highs \u2013 the FTSE 100 hit an all\u2011time high above 9,930 earlier in November \u2013 and are sensitive to any wobble in global risk sentiment or domestic politics. [7]\nGlobal risk tone: Wall Street\u2019s holiday bounce\nOn Friday 28 November, US markets ended a shortened Black Friday session in the green:\n- S&P 500 up about 0.5%,\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average up roughly 0.6%,\n- Nasdaq Composite up around 0.7%. [8]\nFor the week, all three major US indices posted some of their strongest gains since June, even though the Nasdaq ended November down about 1.5%, weighed by renewed concerns over stretched tech valuations. [9]\nThe global picture from late Friday showed:\n- S&P 500: 6,849.09 (+0.54% on the day)\n- FTSE 100: 9,720.51 (+0.27%)\n- DAX: 23,836.79 (+0.29%)\n- Nikkei 225: 50,253.91 (+0.17%) [10]\nThat leaves risk assets heading into December with positive momentum, but also high expectations that central banks will soon deliver rate cuts \u2013 a key theme for UK investors on Monday.\n2. Budget 2025: Markets calm, politics anything but\nWhat markets liked\nThe Autumn Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in late November remains the single biggest domestic story for UK assets going into Monday\u2019s open.\nKey market takeaways from the week: [11]\n- The Budget raised taxes to a post\u2011war high, hitting workers, savers and investors but boosting the government\u2019s fiscal \u201cheadroom\u201d \u2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now estimates nearly \u00a322bn of space in five years\u2019 time.\n- Gilt yields fell sharply in the immediate aftermath. Long\u2011dated yields saw one of their biggest single\u2011day drops since April, signalling that bond investors were reassured by tighter long\u2011term fiscal plans. [12]\n- The pound strengthened and the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both jumped about 0.9\u20131.2% on Budget day, led by banks and miners. [13]\n- Banks rallied after the sector escaped a new windfall levy, making financials one of the best\u2011performing European sectors in November. [14]\nSector moves around the Budget:\n- Banks climbed more than 2% on Budget day as investors cheered the absence of new targeted taxes. [15]\n- Precious metal miners surged over 5% as gold prices rallied on growing expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut. [16]\n- Homebuilders fell roughly 1% amid higher property taxes on high\u2011value real estate. [17]\n- Whitbread, the Premier Inn owner, slumped by around 11\u201312% over the week, after analysts warned that changes to business rates could wipe tens of millions from annual profits.

                "body": "The U.S. New York stock market closed higher across the board on the 28th, the last trading day of November. However, volatility centered around tech stocks had shaken the market since mid-November, and conflicting predictions over whether the benchmark interest rate would be cut in December heightened instability more than ever. On Wall Street, expectations are growing that December\u2019s market, with lower volatility than November, could see a \u201cSanta rally\u201d around Christmas.\nNovember\u2019s New York stock market was marked by turmoil. The likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut, as predicted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) FedWatch Tool, hovered around 60% at the start of the month but dropped to 30%, only to rise to the 80% range in the final week of November. The U.S. federal government shutdown, which delayed the release of economic data, played a significant role. Additionally, the AI bubble theory spread across the market, leading to sharp fluctuations in tech stocks. However, as the month progressed, the labor market showed rigidity, with the U.S. Department of Labor reporting an unemployment rate of 4.4% in September\u2014higher than expected\u2014while inflation remained at a non-alarming level. This bolstered expectations of a rate cut next month, and the market gradually stabilized. Consequently, the New York stock market ended November with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.3%, the large-cap-focused S&P 500 Index up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 1.5%. The Nasdaq\u2019s decline marked its first monthly loss since March.\nWall Street sources predict that December could have fewer market-moving factors than November. Key corporate earnings-related factors have already been mostly reflected in stock prices, and expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut have recovered. CNBC, a U.S. economic media outlet, stated, \u201cAs the holiday season approaches, the flow of economic news will decrease,\u201d adding, \u201cmarket participants are gauging how much buying power investors still have.\u201d The FedWatch Tool currently assigns an 86.4% probability to a December rate cut, with a 0.25 percentage point reduction aligning with the Fed\u2019s October projection. The Wall Street Journal noted, \u201cEven a modest rate cut could demonstrate the Fed\u2019s recognition of the labor market\u2019s slowdown and its readiness to respond.\u201d There is also potential for a Santa rally, a seasonal phenomenon where stock prices rise around year-end and early January. The rally typically occurs due to year-end bonuses and heightened consumer sentiment.\nHowever, market observers caution that the recent contraction in consumer sentiment and the lingering risk of the AI bubble theory require close monitoring. In November, Nvidia, a leading AI stock, fell 12.5%, while Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, which launched \u201cGemini 3,\u201d surged, threatening a market capitalization of $4 trillion. CNBC remarked, \u201cAs recent weeks have shown, sentiment can easily become overheated and unsettle investors.\u201d The Santa rally is not guaranteed annually; last year, the market declined for four consecutive trading days from just after Christmas to year-end. Additionally, the Conference Board, a U.S. non-profit economic research organization, reported that the consumer confidence index for November fell by 6.8 percentage points to 88.7, continuing signals of frozen consumer sentiment."

                "body": "The 2025-26 season began, more or less, a few minutes into the last game of the 2024-25 season, during Game Seven of the N.B.A. Finals, when Tyrese Haliburton, the Indiana Pacers star, stood above the arc with the ball, planted his right foot as he began to drive, and then sprawled to the ground. As the Oklahoma City Thunder scooped up the ball and raced past Haliburton, who lay face down, he pounded the ground. Haliburton, already dealing with a calf strain, had torn his Achilles tendon. Without him, the Pacers didn\u2019t stand a chance. The game\u2014and the season\u2014was effectively over.\nAt the time he was injured, in June, Haliburton was playing in his ninety-sixth game since the season began. After the injury, it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll play in any games this season at all. The impact of his injury has been devastating to the Pacers\u2019 prospects, and he\u2019s hardly the only key player on the team to miss significant time so far, with disastrous results. The Pacers went from winning the Eastern Conference this past summer to starting this season with a dismal 4\u201316 record.\nOther teams can tell similar, if less dramatic, stories. Jayson Tatum, of the defending-champion Boston Celtics, tore his Achilles in the final minutes of an intense playoff game against the New York Knicks last season, ruining his team\u2019s hopes of a repeat. There\u2019s a small chance that he\u2019ll return this spring, but in the off-season the Celtics blew up its core of expensive veteran players anyway, acknowledging that their hopes of winning this season were wrecked. The Houston Rockets made a splashy trade for Kevin Durant in July, hoping to contend for a championship this go-around, before their starting point guard, Fred VanVleet, went down with a torn A.C.L. in September. LeBron James did not play in the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 opening game while suffering from sciatica, his first time missing the start of the season in twenty-three years, and was off the court until mid-November. The Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo rampaged through the first few weeks before injuring his groin. The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 miraculously long and skilled young Frenchman, Victor Wembanyama, who electrified the league at the start of the season, is now missing time with a calf strain. Several other star players, including Anthony Davis and Ja Morant, have also been out with strained calves. On Wednesday, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry hobbled to the locker room after a series of collisions and is expected to miss at least a week with a bruised quad. And so on.\nInjuries happen, especially when one player crashes into another at high speeds, as Curry did. But injuries right now are happening at an alarming rate\u2014particularly those that involve trauma to muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Last season was one of the most injury-marred seasons in N.B.A. history. According to the athletic trainer Jeff Stotts, who tracks injury data, players missed around sixty-five hundred games with injuries\u2014the highest in nearly twenty years, not counting the COVID seasons. The first month and a half of this season has been just as bad. The difference is that such a high proportion of stars\u2014defined in this case as a player who has made an All-Star or All-N.B.A. team at least once in the past three seasons\u2014have been affected by soft-tissue injuries. Stars have already missed more than two hundred games between them. It is the story of the season so far: on any given night, nearly half the league\u2019s best and most well-known players are sitting on the bench, in street clothes.\nAnd yet the games so far this season have been thrilling: dramatic, high-quality, fun, fast. Really fast. According to ESPN Research, the average pace of play is the fastest it has been in nearly forty years. And players are running farther and faster, on average, than at any point since player tracking began, in 2013-14. It\u2019s easy to see, and to understand why. For years, teams across the league developed better and better offenses. Shot s"

Bloomberg\u2019s sources said the conversations will revolve around Su-57 fighter aircraft and a newer version of the S-500 defence system, although no agreement is expected during the visit.\nRead more: Putin's visit sparks $100bln trade ambitions amidst global tensions\nBalancing Moscow and Washington\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently preserved the country\u2019s decades-old defence relationship with Russia while also strengthening strategic ties with the US in recent years. India has reduced its heavy dependence on Russian weapons by increasing acquisitions from the US and Europe, but Moscow remains its biggest arms supplier.According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia was still India\u2019s largest source of military hardware over the four-year period ending 2024, even though total purchases fell notably during that time.\nIndia needs more fighter jets, Air Force backs Russian upgrade\nIndia currently operates more than 200 Russian fighter jets and already possesses several S-400 air defence batteries, which were deployed during the brief conflict with Pakistan in May. With the Air Force short of combat aircraft, service chiefs have pushed the government to consider acquiring next-generation fighters from Moscow.Officials quoted by Bloomberg said pilots would find the transition to the Su-57 smooth because of familiarity with Russian combat systems, while state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is capable of maintaining and servicing the expanded fleet. The Su-57\u2019s long-range missiles would also give India added beyond-visual-range capability.\nFocus on delivery delays during Putin visit\nSources told ANI that India will prioritise deeper defence cooperation and seek clarity on the delayed delivery of the remaining S-400 batteries during the Putin-Modi talks. Speaking at ANI\u2019s National Security Summit, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said the dialogue will focus on the \u201cbroader elements of defence cooperation\u201d rather than headline-grabbing announcements.\u201cAdditional S-400 systems are not off the table, but this meeting is not meant for major declarations,\u201d Singh said. He added that Russia has now assured India that pending S-400 deliveries will be completed in the 2026\u201327 financial year.\nIndia is also expected to push Moscow to accelerate other delayed programmes, including the Su-30 upgrade and several ongoing joint projects.\nDefence partnership continues, but trade also in focus\nWhile talks on fresh Russian military equipment are unlikely to conclude during this week\u2019s visit, defence ties are set to remain a core pillar of the relationship. Singh reiterated that India does not intend to stop defence cooperation with Russia and will continue procuring from both Moscow and Washington.Beyond security, economic ties will share space on the agenda. New Delhi will host a mega India-Russia Business Forum on 4 and 5 December, coinciding with Putin\u2019s visit, as both nations target $100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030.\nInputs from agencies"

                "body": "By Ankur Banerjee\nSINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) \u2013 Stocks turned lower on Monday after a strong end to November as a bout of risk aversion gripped markets even as U.S. rate-cut optimism remained intact while the yen firmed, with investors weighing the prospect of a rate hike as soon as this month. The spotlight in the currency market has been on the Japanese yen, which strengthened to 155.47 per U.S. dollar as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda took the stage in Nagoya with investors looking for cues on the timing of the next hike. Ueda said in a speech to business leaders that the central bank would consider the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of raising rates at its next policy meeting, providing the strongest signal yet on whether a hike was on the cards later this month. Ueda is due to speak again later in the day.\nHis comments strengthened the yen, pushed the Nikkei down more than 1.5% and Japanese government bond yields to 17-year highs. [JP/] [.T]\nThe two-year JGB yield, the most sensitive to the BOJ\u2019s policy rate, rose 2 basis points to 1.01%, its highest since June 2008.\nThe market has been focusing on the yen for the last few weeks, uncertain over the timing of the next interest rate hike and concerned about fiscal policies under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said traders had taken Ueda\u2019s comments to mean he was \u201calmost on board with a rate hike this month\u201d but that any move was unlikely to end the yen\u2019s weakness.\n\u201cLet\u2019s remember that Japan is edging away from ultra-easy policy, not sprinting.\u201d \u201cThat means the yen can claw back some ground on BOJ hints and lower global yields, yet it\u2019s hard to call the end of yen weakness while U.S.\u2013Japan rate gaps remain this wide,\u201d Chanana said.\nSTOCKS SURRENDER AFTER STRONG NOVEMBER\nAfter a strong end to November, where investors shrugged off worries of an AI bubble, traders were looking for catalysts to continue any upward momentum, with the focus this week on economic data. U.S. stock futures slid in Asian hours, with S&P 500 futures down 0.57% and Nasdaq futures 0.8% lower. Cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether both slumped more than 5%, highlighting the cooling risk appetite. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, though, rose more than 1%, pushing Asian stocks higher. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1%, having gained more than 23% this year and on course for its best annual gain since 2017. \u201cThere\u2019s no single headline driving today\u2019s risk-off tone,\u201d said Saxo\u2019s Chanana, who pointed to several pressure points, including rising JGB yields and sliding cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cAt the same time, weak China PMIs have revived stimulus hopes, which is why Hong Kong stocks are bucking the regional decline.\u201d Investor focus this week will be on U.S. economic releases that cover manufacturing and services activity as well as consumer sentiment. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane, said if the incoming data signalled a slowdown without tipping into recession then sentiment would probably remain upbeat while the U.S. dollar weakens as it typically does at this time of year. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six other rivals, was at 99.414, little changed on the day. The index has dropped 8% this year with much of the losses coming in the first half of the year.\nCONSUMER SPENDING IN FOCUS\nInvestors will watch out for comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later in the day as they look for clues on what the Fed will do when it meets next week.\nTraders are pricing in an 87% chance of a cut after a slew of dovish comments from policymakers in the last few days. Attention will also be on holiday consumer spending as data from Black Friday and Cyber Monday retail sales events trickle in. U.S. shoppers spent a record $11.8 billion online on Black Friday, up 9.1% from 2024, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks visits shoppers make to online retail websites.
