                "body": "Gold, the perennial safe-haven asset, is currently experiencing a historic rally, with its price firmly set on a trajectory towards the $3,800 per ounce mark. This unprecedented surge, unfolding against a backdrop of persistent US inflation and the Federal Reserve's pivot towards interest rate cuts, is reshaping financial market expectations and influencing investment strategies globally. As of September 26, 2025, the precious metal is not just reflecting market anxieties but actively signaling a significant shift in the global economic landscape.\nThe immediate implications of this gold surge are profound. Investors are increasingly flocking to gold as a hedge against currency debasement and economic uncertainty, driving robust demand from both institutional and retail segments. The rally underscores a growing skepticism about the long-term stability of fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar, and highlights gold's enduring appeal as a store of value in turbulent times. This movement is not merely speculative; it is rooted in fundamental economic shifts and a re-evaluation of risk by major financial players.\nThe Unfolding Gold Rush: Inflation, Rate Cuts, and Geopolitical Undercurrents\nGold's journey towards $3,800 has been marked by a series of pivotal events and reactions. Spot gold has consistently traded above $3,750 per ounce, reaching an all-time record of $3,791 per ounce on September 23, 2025. This remarkable ascent represents an 11.25% increase over the past month and an astounding 42.20% gain year-over-year.\nThe rally gained significant momentum throughout 2025, breaking past the $3,500 threshold earlier in the year. A key moment occurred on September 18, 2025, when the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. Gold initially surged to a new high of $3,707.40 per ounce immediately after the announcement. However, a less dovish-than-expected outlook from Fed Chair Jerome Powell led to a swift, albeit temporary, pullback of nearly $50. The broader bullish trend quickly reasserted itself, culminating in the new historic peak just days later.\nThe persistent upward pressure on US inflation, particularly the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, has been a critical catalyst. The core PCE index, excluding volatile food and energy components, reported a 2.9% year-over-year increase in August 2025. This marks the 19th consecutive month that core PCE inflation has remained above the Fed's 2% target, firmly entrenching gold's role as an inflation hedge. Historical data shows gold performing exceptionally well when US inflation exceeds 3%, delivering average annual returns of 14.9% during such periods.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) itself is a central player in this drama. On September 17, 2025, the Fed cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.00%-4.25%. This \"risk-management cut,\" as described by Chair Powell, was in response to a weakening labor market. Crucially, the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (the \"dot plot\"), released in September 2025, indicated that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members anticipate two additional 25-basis-point rate cuts before the end of 2025, likely in October and December. These projections, coupled with elevated PCE inflation forecasts (3% for PCE and 3.1% for core PCE in 2025), signal an environment of negative real interest rates, a highly favorable condition for gold.\nBeyond monetary policy, global central banks have emerged as formidable drivers of gold demand. Over the past three years (2022-2024), central banks engaged in an unprecedented gold-buying spree, acquiring over 1,000 metric tons annually, a trend that continued into 2025. This vigorous accumulation, particularly by emerging market central banks like the People's Bank of China and the National Bank of Poland, is motivated by a desire to diversify reserves away from the US dollar, hedge against geopolitical risks, and protect against inflation.

This should keep the loonie on the back foot for now,\u201d the report said.\nLooking ahead, commodity prices may become a stronger support for the loonie in 2026, the report suggested.\n\u201cA more broad-based rise in Canada\u2019s terms of trade, including higher energy prices, may help revive the loonie\u2019s \u2018commodity currency\u2019 status,\u201d it said. \u201cThat outcome would also depend on whether higher prices and shifts in government policy stimulate domestic production \u2014 either through new capital investment or the activation of idle capacity.\u201d"

Over the last few weeks, a tsunami of reports has been published about a possible oil glut in the coming months or years, supported by OPEC-8 decisions to increase the export ceiling. However, reality in the market shows a different picture. Until now, no real crude oil price crash is showing; global prices are even very stable, while fundamentals in the markets are increasingly influenced by external geopolitical threats, not only Russian aggression towards NATO, or a heating up of the East Med (Turkey, Israel, Gaza Flotilla), but also increasingly Ukraine\u2019s effective strikes on Russia\u2019s infrastructure.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nAlmost daily, reports are showcasing the strategic success of Ukraine's campaign, which, in addition to its battlefield tactics, has effectively executed precision strikes and drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, fuel depots, and related logistics. These intentional strikes have targeted the Kremlin\u2019s economic lifelines, leading some to assert that the most effective sanctions currently hitting Russia\u2019s war chest or Putin\u2019s lifeline are the Ukrainian drones.\nWhile most energy analysts are still obsessed with OPEC, US shale, or Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza, Russia, not only a pivotal player inside the so-called OPEC+ group, but also one of the world\u2019s leading oil and gas exporters, is looking at a very dire situation. Ukrainian drones are not only degrading Moscow\u2019s ability to turn Russian crude into exportable petroleum products (diesel, gasoline, kerosene) but also forcing Russian refineries to go offline. Both issues are hitting Putin\u2019s war economy very hard, as they decrease options to monetize its hydrocarbon potential (exports) and also force higher domestic price settings for Russian citizens and external parties. Lately, in a move to squeeze Russia really, Ukraine has increased its attacks on Russian oil ports, in a move to hit export potential, while in the end forcing Russian crude oil production to be shut in.\nThe current situation, combined with increased geopolitical risks and strong global demand, suggests a potential shift towards a bullish environment. Even OPEC+'s theoretical production and export increases may not be enough to mitigate this shift, or in some cases, may not be sufficient at all. This potential for a bullish market should prompt all market participants to adopt preparedness and strategic planning.\nThe latest reports from Russia indicate that Ukrainian drones have hit dozens of Russian fuel facilities, while at the same time, maritime drones and missiles are being used. The potential of Ukraine\u2019s latest military addition, the Flamingo Missile, could be a watershed development. This missile can reach much further into Russian territory with a larger payload, potentially causing significant damage to key oil and gas infrastructure. Western and Russian outlets have also indicated that over a million barrels per day of refining throughput is being hit or removed from the market, as major refineries and pipeline centers are being shut down or taken offline. For global oil markets, Russia\u2019s exports are significant, as it is a leading exporter of diesel, fuel oil, and kerosene. The potential impact of the Flamingo Missile, combined with the ongoing drone attacks, underscores the evolving nature of the geopolitical risks in the oil market.\nWhile global markets are being hit increasingly, even if additional Russian crude is exported, the situation has become very dire. Independent reports from Russia indicate severe fuel shortages in several regions of the country, not only impacting the war economy sectors (manufacturing, defense) but also increasing the potential for inter"

This rebound puts the market on track for its steepest weekly advance since the Israel\u2013Iran war began, with traders pricing in heightened geopolitical risks and supply chain uncertainty. Louisiana Light jumped 2.50% to $67.78, while Bonny Light from Nigeria slumped nearly 3% to $78.62, highlighting fragmentation across benchmarks as disruptions in refining and shipping routes continue to ripple through global trade flows.\nMiddle East Conflict and Tariff Fallout Reshape Supply Outlook\nThe Israel\u2013Iran tensions are not only escalating security risks across vital shipping lanes but also injecting fear premiums into Brent, the seaborne benchmark. On top of that, U.S. tariffs announced by President Trump\u2014ranging from 25% on heavy trucks to 100% on pharmaceuticals\u2014have intensified concerns over global trade demand. These moves affect energy consumption patterns in transport and manufacturing, potentially softening medium-term demand even as near-term risk premiums lift prices. The geopolitical layer keeps Brent above $70 despite weaker macro indicators, while WTI has lagged as domestic supply remains heavy at the Cushing hub.\nOPEC+ Policy, Russia\u2019s Strains, and Iraq\u2019s Export Restart\nOPEC+ output management remains a decisive factor. Fresh reports suggest the cartel\u2019s production hikes may not be as aggressive as feared, giving the market some support. At the same time, Russia is wrestling with refinery disruptions after drone strikes, forcing it to redirect flows and driving diesel shortages across Europe. Iraq is expected to restart Kurdistan exports on September 27, which could add pressure back onto Brent if volumes normalize. The OPEC basket sits at $71.50, advancing 1%, reflecting controlled supply discipline but leaving traders alert to fresh volatility.\nInventory Draws and Arbitrage Pressure in U.S. Oil Flows\nRecent U.S. data showed declining crude and gasoline inventories, adding a bullish element to the supply picture. Gasoline futures rose 1.62% to $2.035, underlining tightness at the consumer level. At the same time, the arbitrage window for American crude shipments into Asia is narrowing, limiting U.S. export competitiveness. Mars U.S. crude fell 1.33% to $71.01, showing how regional grades are diverging. This arbitrage closing makes Brent relatively firmer, even as WTI consolidates around the $65 mark, underscoring how global logistics are shaping spreads.\nRead More\n-\nKBWB ETF Climbs to $79.84 With 39.8% Annual Return, Banks Drive Rally Toward $93 Target\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Flows Whipsaw $241M In and $258M Out as BTC-USD Stalls at $109K\u2014 Bulls Target $146K in October\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Drop to $2.83, Storage Surplus and AECO Crash Weigh as LNG Flows Steady\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Powers Toward \u00a5150.00 After Strong U.S. Data and BoJ Inflation Miss\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Pressure: WTI Stalls at $65 While Brent Tests the 200-Day EMA\nFrom a charting perspective, WTI crude (CL=F) faces stiff resistance at the $65\u201366.50 corridor, a range that has acted as both support and resistance repeatedly.

Four sources familiar with the matter said the refinery could operate for two months and provide refined products to cover demand for slightly longer.\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom Neft owns a 44.9% stake in NIS, an investment unit of Russia\u2019s Gazprom has around 11.3%, and the Serbian government 29.9%.\nLONG-TERM ENERGY SECURITY UNCERTAIN\nNIS operates Serbia\u2019s only oil refinery and supplies around 80% of Serbia\u2019s diesel and gasoline demand, and 90% or more of jet fuel and heavy fuel oil, a trader told Reuters.\nThe U.S. sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s oil sector were announced on January 10 but had been repeatedly postponed.\nOnce they are enforced, foreign banks may halt transactions with NIS, leaving domestic banks, which lack sufficient capacity.\n\"Authorities need to immediately ensure NIS has access to domestic financial markets, and then within the next month or two, do whatever it takes to keep the Pancevo refinery running,\" said one Serbian fuel industry source who asked not to be named.\n\"There\u2019s no alternative for market supply without the refinery operating.\"\nNIS is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) and Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and as such is one of Russia\u2019s last remaining oil assets in Europe.\nEarlier this year, Reuters reported that NIS was struggling to buy oil from traders abroad, while at home its former clients were seeking alternative fuel suppliers due to the pending sanctions.\nJANAF PIPELINE IMPACT\nNIS\u2019 4.8 million ton/year capacity Pancevo refinery gets all of its crude oil via Croatia\u2019s JANAF pipeline.\nJANAF confirmed on Friday it would have to cease supplies to NIS when the sanctions take effect, but will appeal to the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to extend its licence.\n\"It is now for NIS to provide evidence to explain why the licence should be extended,\" Vladislav Veselica, a JANAF board member, told Reuters.\nHe said the company\u2019s lawyers in the U.S. would file for the extension on Friday. NIS accounts for more than 30% of JANAF revenues.\nShould you invest $2,000 in GAZP right now?\nMost investors will find it hard to answer that question with total confidence.

Four sources familiar with the matter said the refinery could operate for two months and provide refined products to cover demand for slightly longer.\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom Neft owns a 44.9% stake in NIS, an investment unit of Russia\u2019s Gazprom has around 11.3%, and the Serbian government 29.9%.\nLONG-TERM ENERGY SECURITY UNCERTAIN\nNIS operates Serbia\u2019s only oil refinery and supplies around 80% of Serbia\u2019s diesel and gasoline demand, and 90% or more of jet fuel and heavy fuel oil, a trader told Reuters.\nThe U.S. sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s oil sector were announced on January 10 but had been repeatedly postponed.\nOnce they are enforced, foreign banks may halt transactions with NIS, leaving domestic banks, which lack sufficient capacity.\n\"Authorities need to immediately ensure NIS has access to domestic financial markets, and then within the next month or two, do whatever it takes to keep the Pancevo refinery running,\" said one Serbian fuel industry source who asked not to be named.\n\"There\u2019s no alternative for market supply without the refinery operating.\"\nNIS is majority-owned by Russia\u2019s Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) and Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and as such is one of Russia\u2019s last remaining oil assets in Europe.\nEarlier this year, Reuters reported that NIS was struggling to buy oil from traders abroad, while at home its former clients were seeking alternative fuel suppliers due to the pending sanctions.\nJANAF PIPELINE IMPACT\nNIS\u2019 4.8 million ton/year capacity Pancevo refinery gets all of its crude oil via Croatia\u2019s JANAF pipeline.\nJANAF confirmed on Friday it would have to cease supplies to NIS when the sanctions take effect, but will appeal to the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to extend its licence.\n\"It is now for NIS to provide evidence to explain why the licence should be extended,\" Vladislav Veselica, a JANAF board member, told Reuters.\nHe said the company\u2019s lawyers in the U.S. would file for the extension on Friday. NIS accounts for more than 30% of JANAF revenues.\nShould you invest $2,000 in GAZP right now?\nWith GAZP making headlines, savvy investors are asking: Is it truly valued fairly?

                "body": "Shale Oil Decline Raises Concerns as Firms Look Overseas\nA new Dallas Federal Reserve report warns of a slowdown in oil production across Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana, sparking industry debate over whether shale oil production is entering its twilight.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also projects a potential drop in U.S. oil output in 2026. If it happens, it would mark the first decline since 2021. Analysts attribute the expected decrease to falling oil prices and reduced drilling activity, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nShale oil decline shifts focus overseas\nThe Dallas Fed survey revealed many U.S. oil and gas executives now believe international projects will become more commercially viable. With capital spending expected to fall, 43% of exploration and production (E&P) firms anticipate a decline in third-quarter investments. Oilfield service companies also forecast a 42% drop in spending.\nSome executives told the Fed that overseas opportunities may provide the best growth prospects as U.S. shale drilling slows.\nContinental Resources invests in Turkey\nOne notable move is from Oklahoma City-based Continental Resources. Earlier this year, the company signed a joint venture with Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) to develop shale fields in the Diyarbakir Basin.\nFounded in 1954, TPAO has long been a cornerstone of Turkey\u2019s energy industry, spearheading hydrocarbon exploration and refining projects. The venture highlights the growing global shift as U.S. firms diversify beyond domestic shale plays.\nUncertainty ahead for U.S. shale oil production\nThe industry remains cautious as it awaits upcoming third-quarter earnings reports from major producers. The financial disclosures will confirm whether the predicted capital expenditure slowdown is materializing.\nExecutives stress that without stronger oil prices, U.S. production growth may stagnate, accelerating the shift toward international ventures.\nSource: Reuters | Edited by Oklahoma Energy Today for clarity"

                "body": "EUR/USD recovers on Friday as traders\u2019 confidence rises that the Federal Reserve would reduce interest rates after the release of the latest inflation report in the United States (US). At the time of writing, the pair trades at 1.1697 up 0.27%.\nThe week ended in a recovery mode for the shared currency after the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revealed that the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index was aligned with estimates, but shy of the 3% threshold.\nAfter the announcement, bets that the Fed would reduce borrowing costs increased from 84% a day ago to 88%m revealed the Prime Market Terminal interest rate probability tool.\nFederal Reserve officials crossed the wires. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman was dovish as she said that the labor market is fragile and should the conditions deteriorate, they would need to adjust policy at a faster pace. Earlier Richmond\u2019s Fed Thomas Barkin said both inflation and unemployment are moving in the wrong direction, but the downside is limited.\nIn Europe, a scarce economic docket left traders adrift to geopolitics. Tensions in Europe seem to weigh on the Euro as NATO warned Russia that it is prepared to intercept Russian aircraft. According to Bloomberg, European officials privately told Russia they are ready to shoot down jets and view Russia\u2019s Estonia incursion as deliberate.\nNext week, the US schedule will feature a flurry of Fed speakers, US ADP National Employment Change, the ISM Manufacturing PMI, Initial Jobless Claims and Nonfarm Payrolls for September.\nAcross the pond, the European schedule will feature Business Climate, Consumer Confidence, the Economic Sentiment Indicator, September inflation figures and a flurry of ECB speakers. Also, traders should be wary of Flash PMIs and German inflation and Retail Sales.\nEUR/USD ended the week on a lower note, yet it seems to have found its foot, at around 1.1650. After reaching the latter, the pair edged back towards 1.1700 but failed to end the day/week above that price level.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bearish. This, and EUR/USD failure at 1.1700, could clear the path for further downside.\nThe first support would be 1.1650, followed by 1.1600. If cleared, the next support would be the 100-day SMA At 1.1588. Conversely, if buyers reclaim 1.1700, the next resistance would be 1.1750 ahead of the 1.1800 mark.\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global"

                "body": "EUR/USD Forecast: Forex Friday September 26, 2025\n- EUR/USD forecast partly hinges on today\u2019s US core PCE print\n- Geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard for the euro\n- US labour market in sharp focus in week ahead as traders reassess Fed easing bets\nThe US dollar extended its post-FOMC bounce this week on the back of surprisingly strong economic data, forcing markets to trim expectations for additional Fed rate cuts. That resilience has \u2013 for now \u2013 pushed the EUR/USD lower, but the pair could be setting up for a reversal if inflation numbers fail to justify the recent hawkish repricing. Today\u2019s release of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, is crucial\u2014 a tame 0.2% m/m print or lower could be all it takes for the dollar to give back some of its gains, allowing EUR/USD to rebound. Next week, we will have plenty of US employment data that could impact the EUR/USD forecast, while from the Eurozone CPI and German retail sales are among the highlights.\nDollar finds support from data surprises\nThe dollar\u2019s move higher this week has been underpinned by a rare run of upbeat data. GDP for Q2 was revised up sharply from 3.3% to 3.8%, boosted by personal consumption. Weekly jobless claims have also steadied, suggesting that the spike to 264k earlier this month was an anomaly rather than the start of a worrying trend. Meanwhile, durable goods orders jumped 2.9% in August and housing figures also surprised to the upside.\nWhile this string of data is dollar-positive, the move feels stretched. The Fed is still in easing mode, and markets remain sensitive to any disappointment in upcoming numbers. If today\u2019s PCE inflation data confirms a cooling trend, rate-cut expectations for December could shift back higher.\nEUR/USD forecast: Limited euro weakness\nGeopolitics has also played a role in determining the EUR/USD forecast. Tensions in Europe have pressured the euro, lending the greenback a temporary bid. NATO has warned this week that it is prepared to intercept Russian aircraft. Any escalation could keep the dollar bid, but a de-escalation would likely flip the script.\nDespite the dollar\u2019s recent dominance, EUR/USD hasn\u2019t collapsed. The single currency has held its own relatively well against other currencies. That suggests the euro still has a cushion, particularly if markets begin to question whether the dollar\u2019s rally has gone too far, too fast.\nOn the eurozone data front, this week\u2019s signals were mixed. French PMI numbers disappointed, slipping below the 50.0 expansion line, while Germany\u2019s services PMI printed a healthier 52.5, lifting the overall eurozone services index to 51.4. Eurozone manufacturing, however, remains stuck in contraction territory, and sentiment surveys such as Germany\u2019s Ifo and GfK continue to highlight a subdued outlook.\nWhat\u2019s next: busy US data week could define the trend\nLooking ahead, eurozone CPI estimates and German retail sales will set the tone next week. Weak consumption data could weigh on sentiment, but if inflation holds firm, it may temper dovish ECB expectations\u2014giving EUR/USD some support. But the EUR/USD forecast is likely be impacted more from the US side of things. Beyond today\u2019s PCE release, the US calendar is stacked with key employment data. JOLTS job openings, ADP private payrolls, ISM surveys, and Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls will all feed into the Fed narrative. With the dollar feeling a little overextended, it may take another strong set of prints to maintain the bullish momentum. Otherwise, profit-taking could see EUR/USD bounce back in the near term.\nAmong the abovementioned employment pointers, JOLTS Job Openings (Tuesday) and non-farm payrolls (Friday) are likely to be the most important ones to watch.\nWith much of the focus being on a softening US labour market, while inflation concerns linger, any indications of further weakening here should boost expectations of two more rate cuts for 2025. The JOLTS job openings data is forward-looking and will be taken together with the week"

PCE inflation at 2.7% leaves Fed cautious, while technicals show 1.1650 support in play and downside risk to 1.1610\u20131.1575 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Struggles Near 1.1675 as U.S. Data Boosts Dollar Strength\nThe EUR/USD pair is pinned close to three-week lows, trading around 1.1675 after bouncing from intraday lows of 1.1645. The euro has lost about 0.55% this week, pressured by a run of upbeat U.S. economic releases that have reinforced the dollar\u2019s dominance. Revised second-quarter U.S. GDP showed a 3.8% annualized expansion, stronger than the 3.3% previously reported, driven largely by resilient consumer spending. At the same time, durable goods orders jumped 2.9% in August following two months of declines, while initial jobless claims fell to 218,000, their lowest since July, signaling ongoing labor market strength. These figures prompted markets to trim bets on deep Federal Reserve easing and lifted the dollar index back above 98.20, the highest in three weeks.\nTrump\u2019s Tariff Announcements Deepen Euro Weakness Against USD\nAlongside strong U.S. data, fresh trade measures from President Trump have added to euro selling pressure. Washington announced new tariffs of 100% on branded medicines, 25% on heavy trucks, and 50% on kitchen cabinets, reigniting concerns of a broader trade war. The move spurred risk aversion during Asian trading hours and supported flows into the U.S. dollar, leaving EUR/USD struggling to regain ground above 1.1690. Markets remain cautious that tariff escalation could weigh on global growth while reinforcing dollar demand as a safe-haven play.\nInflation Data Shapes Fed Policy Expectations\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the PCE Price Index, rose 0.3% MoM in August, pushing the yearly pace to 2.7% from 2.6%. The core PCE held steady at 2.9% YoY, matching consensus. These readings confirm inflation progress is slowing but not collapsing, giving the Fed little room to ease aggressively. Market pricing via the CME FedWatch tool now implies an 87% probability of an October cut, down from above 90% earlier this week, with odds for a 50-bp move shrinking to 62% from nearly 80%.\nTechnical Landscape: EUR/USD Faces Key Support at 1.1650\nChart structure shows EUR/USD validated a bearish shift after breaking below its short-term uptrend line. Momentum indicators remain in negative territory, with RSI hovering near 31, close to oversold but still allowing further downside. Key support sits at 1.1650, which held both on Thursday and earlier in September. A decisive break beneath this zone would expose 1.1610 and the late-August low at 1.1575. On the topside, resistance is lined up near 1.1725, followed by 1.1755 and the September highs at 1.1820. Unless the euro reclaims the 200-day EMA around 1.1710, the bias remains tilted lower.\nConsumer Sentiment and Fed Commentary Awaited\nBeyond PCE, traders are watching the University of Michigan sentiment index and remarks from Fed Governor Bowman for further guidance. Earlier Fed speeches showed mixed views: some officials like Kansas City\u2019s Jeffrey Schmid pushed for more cuts to protect jobs, while Chicago\u2019s Austan Goolsbee warned against premature easing given persistent inflation. This divergence has left EUR/USD vulnerable to every data point, with sentiment swings exaggerated by thin positioning.\nRead More\n-\nKBWB ETF Climbs to $79.84 With 39.8% Annual Return, Banks Drive Rally Toward $93 Target\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Flows Whipsaw $241M In and $258M Out as BTC-USD Stalls at $109K\u2014 Bulls Target $146K in October\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Drop to $2.83, Storage Surplus and AECO Crash Weigh as LNG Flows Steady\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar t"

The move reflects a sharp 3% decline from the September high at 1.3725 as U.S. economic strength has undercut the case for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, while the Bank of England remains caught between sticky inflation and weakening domestic growth.\nImpact of U.S. Growth and Inflation Data on GBP/USD\nThe second-quarter U.S. GDP revision to 3.8% year-on-year, coupled with weekly jobless claims falling to 218,000 and durable goods orders surging 2.9%, has provided the dollar with renewed momentum. These numbers highlight U.S. economic resilience and have reduced expectations for back-to-back Fed cuts in 2025. Meanwhile, markets await the Core PCE inflation print at 2.9% year-on-year, a figure that could cement the Fed\u2019s cautious stance and extend downside pressure on GBP/USD if it overshoots consensus.\nBank of England Uncertainty Weighs on Sterling\nGovernor Andrew Bailey has acknowledged that U.K. inflation is on a downward path but linked future easing directly to progress in consumer prices. This hesitancy is complicated by other MPC members, such as Megan Greene, warning against premature cuts amid lingering upside risks. Political noise in London\u2014calls for re-nationalization of utilities and large-scale borrowing schemes\u2014has rattled gilt markets already strained by fragile demand. With households sitting on unusually high savings and labor conditions softening, the pound has struggled to find a solid base against the dollar.\nTechnical Breakdown of GBP/USD Levels\nTechnically, GBP/USD\u2019s inability to reclaim 1.3390, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the January\u2013July rally, leaves bears in control. A sustained break under 1.3330 risks a slide toward 1.3255, followed by deeper targets at 1.3145 and the 200-day SMA near 1.3130. On the flip side, only a decisive recovery above 1.3470\u20131.3500, where the 20- and 50-day SMAs converge, would ease bearish momentum and allow a rebound toward 1.3600. Until then, the bias remains skewed to the downside with 1.3300\u20131.3260 acting as the next key pivot zone.\nRead More\n-\nKBWB ETF Climbs to $79.84 With 39.8% Annual Return, Banks Drive Rally Toward $93 Target\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Flows Whipsaw $241M In and $258M Out as BTC-USD Stalls at $109K\u2014 Bulls Target $146K in October\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Drop to $2.83, Storage Surplus and AECO Crash Weigh as LNG Flows Steady\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Powers Toward \u00a5150.00 After Strong U.S. Data and BoJ Inflation Miss\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nShort-Term Pound Sterling Outlook Against the Dollar\nThe stochastic oscillator sitting below 20 suggests the pair is oversold, and price action beneath the lower Bollinger band signals the potential for a short-lived bounce.

Yet, the price has not closed below September\u2019s floor of 1.3332, creating speculation that the plunge could soon take a breather.

                "body": "- The British Pound steadies after a two-day slide, with GBP/USD staging a modest recovery.\n- The US PCE inflation report came broadly in line with forecasts, keeping the Fed\u2019s outlook steady.\n- The core PCE Price Index rose 0.2% MoM, matching expectations, and headline PCE rose 0.3% MoM in August, up from 0.2% in July.\nThe British Pound (GBP) gains traction against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with GBP/USD snapping a two-day losing streak. At the time of writing, the pair is hovering near 1.3393, staging a modest recovery after dropping to its weakest level in about seven weeks on Thursday.\nFresh momentum in Sterling came after the release of the August US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, which broadly met market forecasts and offered no new hawkish cues for the Federal Reserve (Fed). The data kept the Greenback on the defensive, with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the Greenback\u2019s value against six major peers, easing slightly from three-week highs to trade around 98.35.\nThe core PCE Price Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of underlying inflation, rose 0.2% MoM in August, matching forecasts and below July\u2019s originally reported 0.3%, which was revised down to 0.2%. On an annual basis, core PCE held steady at 2.9%, still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nThe headline PCE Price Index rose 0.3% on the month, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in July, while the annual rate ticked up to 2.7% in August from 2.6% a month earlier. The report also showed that personal income rose 0.4% in August, slightly above expectations, and personal spending climbed 0.6%, up from 0.5% in July, signaling that US consumer demand remains resilient.\nThe latest University of Michigan (UoM) survey showed that both consumer sentiment and expectations softened slightly in September, while short and long-term inflation expectations also eased modestly.\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that while the labor market appears to be softening, the supply of workers is also growing more slowly, which reduces the risk of a sharp spike in unemployment. He stressed that the Fed is now focused on balancing its dual mandate.\nBarkin emphasized that future policy moves will hinge on incoming data, saying the Fed may need to tilt a bit more toward its employment mandate following the recent rate cut, which he argued should support the labor market while keeping pressure on inflation.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has eased from recent highs, trading near the 98.00 mark, as traders reassess the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) monetary policy path.\nThe latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report showed price pressure largely in line with expectations, reinforcing the view that disinflation remains slow. The core PCE rose 0.2% MoM in August, matching forecasts, while the annual rate held steady at 2.9%. The headline PCE rose 0.3% MoM, ticking up to 2.7% YoY, as personal income and spending also posted steady gains, highlighting resilient household demand.\nAdding to the softer tone of the Dollar, the University of Michigan (UoM) survey showed that both consumer sentiment and expectations dipped slightly in September, while short- and long-term inflation expectations also edged lower. The softer household outlook, combined with the in-line PCE data, offered no fresh hawkish cues for the Fed, prompting some profit-taking in the Greenback and allowing the Aussie to rebound from recent lows.\nFocus now shifts to the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) interest rate decision on Tuesday. A recent Reuters poll of 39 economists showed all respondents expect the RBA to keep the cash rate steady at 3.60%. Market pricing via ASX futures also implies a very low probability of a rate cut, with most investors betting that the central bank will hold fire until it gets the Q3 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report in late October.\nMajor Australian banks remain divided on the timing of easing. ANZ, CBA and Westpac continue to forecast a 25-basis-point cut before year-end, most likely in November, assuming inflation resumes its downward trend. By contrast, NAB has pushed back its expected first cut to May 2026, citing persistent price pressures in the services sector and robust household spending.\nIn the US, the spotlight now shifts to the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report due on Friday, with the labor market expected to show a modest rebound. Economists forecast a gain of 39K jobs in September, up from just 22K in August.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for AUD.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Sep 30, 2025 04:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.6%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Reserve Bank of Australia\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This significant move signals a cautious approach by one of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions, driven primarily by a shifting outlook from the Federal Reserve. For anyone engaged in the dynamic Forex market, understanding such shifts is crucial, as they often foreshadow broader trends and present both opportunities and challenges.\nWhat Prompted Bank of America\u2019s AUD/USD Exit?\nBank of America\u2019s decision to exit its long AUD/USD trade wasn\u2019t made in a vacuum. It reflects a recalculation of risk and reward based on evolving macroeconomic signals. A \u2018long\u2019 position implies a belief that the Australian Dollar would strengthen against the US Dollar. Closing this position suggests that the bank no longer holds that conviction, or at least sees increased downside risk. The primary catalyst for this change is the anticipated trajectory of the Federal Reserve policy.\nDecoding the Federal Reserve Policy Shift: Why Does it Matter?\nThe Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, holds immense sway over global financial markets. Its monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates, directly influence the strength of the US Dollar. A hawkish Fed, one that signals higher interest rates or a longer period of tight policy, typically strengthens the dollar. Conversely, a dovish stance can weaken it. Recent communications and economic data points have suggested a subtle but significant shift in the Fed\u2019s outlook. Here\u2019s why this matters for the Forex market:\n- Interest Rate Differentials: Higher US interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive, drawing capital away from other currencies like the AUD.\n- Economic Outlook: The Fed\u2019s assessment of US economic strength provides a benchmark for global economic health. A robust US economy, often supported by higher rates, tends to strengthen the dollar.\n- Risk Sentiment: Changes in Fed policy can alter global risk appetite. A tighter Fed can sometimes lead to a \u2018risk-off\u2019 environment, where investors flock to safe-haven assets like the US Dollar.\nNavigating the Forex Market: Understanding AUD/USD Dynamics\nThe AUD/USD pair is a popular choice among currency traders, often influenced by commodity prices (Australia is a major commodity exporter) and interest rate differentials between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Federal Reserve. When the Fed\u2019s stance shifts, it directly impacts this differential. Historically, a strong US dollar tends to put pressure on the AUD. Factors that typically support the AUD include:\n- Rising commodity prices (especially iron ore, coal).\n- Strong economic data from China (Australia\u2019s largest trading partner).\n- A relatively higher interest rate from the RBA compared to the Fed.\nBank of America\u2019s decision indicates that the balance of these factors has tilted against the AUD, primarily due to the US side of the equation.\nWhat Does This Mean for Currency Trading Strategies?\nFor individual and institutional traders alike, Bank of America\u2019s move offers a crucial lesson in adaptability and risk management. It underscores the importance of constantly re-evaluating currency trading strategies in light of new information, especially from influential central banks. Key takeaways for refining your strategies:\n- Stay Informed: Closely monitor official statements and speeches from the Federal Reserve and other major central bank decisions.\n- Analyze Economic Data: Pay attention to inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP data from both the US and Australia.\n- Technical vs. Fundamental: While technical analysis provides entry and exit points, fundamental analysis (like ce"

The move was powered by a sharp reduction in expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts after a combination of stronger-than-expected U.S. macroeconomic releases. Second-quarter GDP was revised up to 3.8% from 3.2%, while weekly jobless claims fell to 218,000, the lowest since July, countering fears of a softening labor market. The dollar index simultaneously climbed to 97.85 before easing back to 97.50, underlining broad greenback strength that lifted USD/JPY from its early-September lows of 146.90.\nTokyo CPI Miss Adds Pressure on the Yen\nThe Japanese yen\u2019s weakness was exacerbated by softer-than-expected inflation data in Tokyo, where September headline CPI slowed to 2.5% year-on-year from 2.6% in August. The core measure held at 2.5% rather than accelerating to 2.6% as economists had forecast. Markets immediately trimmed the probability of an October Bank of Japan rate hike from 50% to just 35%. The moderation in Japan\u2019s inflation gives policymakers at the BoJ further cover to maintain ultra-accommodative policy, reinforcing the divergence between U.S. and Japanese yields. The move has pushed the yen to its weakest level in eight weeks, with USD/JPY now retesting levels last seen on August 1, when the pair briefly reached 150.00.\nFed Cut Repricing Tightens Link Between Rates and USD/JPY\nCorrelation studies show USD/JPY tracking short-end U.S. yields and Fed funds futures with a coefficient near -0.94 over the past two weeks, a near-lockstep relationship. Futures markets now discount fewer than 50 basis points of additional easing in 2025, compared to nearly 100 basis points just a month earlier. This repricing, tied closely to resilient consumer spending and income growth in the U.S., has made USD/JPY extremely sensitive to U.S. data surprises. Traders note that while the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure\u2014the PCE deflator\u2014rarely shocks, today\u2019s release of spending and income details could prove more consequential for expectations and price action in USD/JPY.\nTechnical Levels: Resistance at 151.00, Support Near 149.00\nUSD/JPY\u2019s technical picture has turned decisively bullish. The pair has broken above its 200-day moving average for the first time since June, now holding support near the \u00a5149.00 level. Momentum gauges confirm the strength of the move: the 14-day RSI is trending higher, and MACD remains firmly in positive territory. Bulls are eyeing resistance at \u00a5151.00, the October 2022 swing high, and further at \u00a5152.40, a level tested in late 2023. On the downside, any slip below \u00a5149.00 could expose the 20-day moving average near \u00a5148.25, while deeper pullbacks might target \u00a5147.50 where demand has previously emerged. Still, with Japan\u2019s inflation losing steam and U.S. data consistently surprising to the upside, the bias remains skewed to the upside for now.\nRead More\n-\nKBWB ETF Climbs to $79.84 With 39.8% Annual Return, Banks Drive Rally Toward $93 Target\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Flows Whipsaw $241M In and $258M Out as BTC-USD Stalls at $109K\u2014 Bulls Target $146K in October\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Drop to $2.83, Storage Surplus and AECO Crash Weigh as LNG Flows Steady\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound to Dollar Slides to 1.3322 as U.S. Growth Outpaces U.K. Outlook and BoE Caution Adds Pressure\n26.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMarket Sentiment and Trading Flows\nInstitutional accounts in Tokyo and New York have bee"

                "body": "During the New York session on Friday (September 26), the US dollar fell 0.13% against the Japanese yen, pressured by stronger-than-expected US PCE data which weighed on the dollar\u2019s performance. It is currently trading near 149.46. We explore the underlying reasons below. Reviewing today's movements, during the early Asian session, following the release of weaker-than-expected Tokyo CPI data from Japan, the exchange rate dropped nearly 30 points from 149.93 to 149.65.\nJapan's September Tokyo CPI data showed that core inflation in Tokyo came in at 2.5%, lower than the expected 2.8%. However, analysts noted that this result was influenced by non-recurring factors. At the same time, the data remains well above the central bank's 2% target, and pricing pressures continue to fuel market expectations for a potential rate hike in the near term. Later during the New York session, following the release of stronger-than-expected US PCE data, the US dollar fell by 40 points against the yen. Below is an analysis of these developments.\nNon-recurring factors may be the main cause of the decline in Tokyo's CPI data.\nThis data will become one of the key pieces of information studied by the Bank of Japan during its policy meeting on October 29-30, when the board will release updated quarterly growth and price forecasts. These forecasts will play a crucial role in their interest rate decisions.\nSpecifically, Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes fuel costs, rose 2.5% year-on-year in September, below the market consensus forecast of a 2.8% increase.\nTokyo's core CPI, a leading indicator of nationwide inflation trends, also saw a year-on-year rise of 2.5% in August.\nThe data shows that the September inflation rate fell short of expectations, mainly due to measures taken by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to ease the pressure of rising living costs, such as reducing childcare fees and water charges.\nDespite some non-recurring factors influencing the figures, Japan's inflation rate is actually slowing down.\nNotably, Japan's Tokyo CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food and fuel costs, is closely monitored by the Bank of Japan as a preferred indicator of underlying inflation. In September, it rose 2.5% year-on-year, compared with a 3.0% increase in August.\nThe food inflation rate, excluding fresh food items such as vegetables, slowed to 6.9% in September from 7.4% in August.\nKoya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, stated: 'The overall trend of slowing food inflation, after excluding one-off factors, remains unchanged.' However, I believe the inflation data itself is still far from the Bank of Japan\u2019s target.\nInflation data supports the Bank of Japan's decision to maintain interest rates unchanged.\nMiyamae expects the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates in December or January next year, pointing out: 'When deciding on the timing of rate hikes, the Bank of Japan must not only focus on price trends but also consider the impact of exports, corporate profits, and U.S. tariffs on the economy.'\nThe Bank of Japan ended a decade-long large-scale stimulus program last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January this year, when the central bank believed Japan was close to sustainably achieving its 2% inflation target.\nHowever, the data shows that the inflation issue remains unresolved.\nAlthough Japan's nationwide core inflation has remained above 2% for more than three consecutive years, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda emphasized that further interest rate hikes should be approached cautiously to ensure that price increases are driven by wage growth and strong domestic demand.\nThe Bank of Japan maintained interest rates unchanged last week. However, there are signs that attention within the central bank's board to increasing price pressures is rising \u2014 two members dissented, proposing to raise interest rates to 0.75%, though the proposal was not adopted.\nRecent rapid ri"

Next resistance sits at \u00a5150.90, a previous top-turned-sell wall.\n\ud83d\udcaa Dollar Gets Lift to 2-Month Top\n- The USDJPY pair climbed to a two-month high of 149.80 on Friday as currency traders were juggling rate-cut expectations and economic news releases.\n- The US dollar has been pushing higher in the past few days, adding pips against a weaker yen in what appears to be an exit of a mid-term consolidation.\n- Between early August and current market prices, the dollar-yen has been range-bound and trading sideways, hugging all three big simple moving averages (SMAs). But that\u2019s not the case anymore.\n\ud83d\udc49 PCE Inflation Points to More Cuts\n- The dollar\u2019s fresh jump got the pair out of the range and above the 200-day moving average, which had been sitting at \u00a5148.50. Next up, if the bulls continue plowing ahead, is the \u00a5150.90 level as a mid-term resistance.\n- But on the flip side, yen bulls and dollar bears might have more in common than they suspect. And the recent inflation data indicated that the outlook for the dollar will likely remain uncertain and even gloomy.\n- PCE inflation was released earlier today, showing that prices increased in line with expectations at 2.9% annual growth in August. In other words, the Fed\u2019s rate-cut plans remain intact and traders still eyeball two trims by the end of the year.\n\ud83e\udd71 Boring Pair Is Boring\n- Technically, that should take away some of the dollar\u2019s appeal. Lower interest rates bring lower yields on fixed-income assets. That threatens to undermine investor confidence in the underlying currency.\n- But on the other end is the Bank of Japan, which is still reluctant to raise rates due to economic worries and growth headaches. All while inflation in Japan stays well above the bank\u2019s 2% target. That stubbornness keeps a lid on yen appreciation.\n- The back-and-forth has been going on for a while now and that\u2019s why this pair hasn\u2019t been a very good bet for the long-term swing traders. Year to date, the dollar-yen is lower by less than 5%. The EURUSD is up 13% over the same time span and the GBPUSD is up 8%."

The jump stems from a resilient US economy and a strong greenback, with investors bracing for next week\u2019s labor report. But RBC still views these moves as short-lived. The bank expects that the Federal Reserve\u2019s eventual interest rate cuts\u2014paired with a Bank of Canada cycle that's mostly in the rearview mirror\u2014will put pressure on USD-CAD in the coming months. Technically, a close above the August peak of 1.3925 points to further upside, with resistance at 1.3977 and 1.4081. Meanwhile, support zones at 1.3925, 1.3862, and 1.3839 are holding up for now, though a drop below 1.3722 could change the story.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Interest rates steer the currency ship.\nWith the US dollar flexing its muscles, currency pairs like USD-CAD are moving in sync with every central bank signal. As traders scrutinize potential Fed and Bank of Canada moves, shifting expectations about rate cuts are fueling volatility in North American currencies. Right now, markets are glued to whether resistance levels will hold\u2014or if USD-CAD\u2019s range is about to crack.\nThe bigger picture: Policy gaps widen the divide.\nAt the heart of USD-CAD\u2019s journey are monetary policy differences. The Fed may be eyeing future cuts as US data holds up, while the Bank of Canada seems nearly done with its own cycle. These decisions ripple out to influence investment flows, Canadian exports, and even commodity prices. As policies evolve, they\u2019ll shape where the Canadian dollar heads next\u2014and how global investors play their cross-border bets.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nAlex Smith \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 9 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 9 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

This should keep the loonie on the back foot for now,\u201d the report said.\nLooking ahead, commodity prices may become a stronger support for the loonie in 2026, the report suggested.\n\u201cA more broad-based rise in Canada\u2019s terms of trade, including higher energy prices, may help revive the loonie\u2019s \u2018commodity currency\u2019 status,\u201d it said. \u201cThat outcome would also depend on whether higher prices and shifts in government policy stimulate domestic production \u2014 either through new capital investment or the activation of idle capacity.\u201d"

                "body": "Written by Joey Frenette at The Motley Fool Canada\nThe Canadian dollar has been in a bit of a slump over the past few weeks, recently sinking to around US$0.71 or so. Undoubtedly, as the Bank of Canada continues to reduce interest rates alongside the Fed, the loonie might not have a chance to strengthen versus the U.S. dollar. And with the Canadian economy facing challenges at the hands of tariffs and pressures on the price of oil, there\u2019s certainly potential for more pain in the loonie before the next big bounce.\nEither way, various pundits think that the loonie might actually be in for a bit of a break as it looks to gain a couple of cents going into the new year. And while the Canadian economy seems to be facing more than its fair share of headwinds, I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see the loonie rise to the US$0.73\u20130.75 range by next summer. Indeed, a gain of a few cents to nearly a nickel might not seem like much, but it could mean a great deal for the firms that make most, if not all, of their money on this side of the border.\nWho knows? If the Bank of Canada started its rate-cutting cycle first, it might also be the first to hit the pause button. Of course, there\u2019s also a chance that the Fed takes on a slightly more hawkish tilt before the Bank of Canada does. And if that happens, there is the risk of more pain for the Canadian dollar. Either way, here are two stocks I\u2019d check out as the U.S. dollar looks to weaken a bit versus the loonie over the next year.\nMagna International\nMagna International (TSX:MG) is a Canadian auto-part maker that\u2019s starting to pick up speed, now up over 26% in the past three months. Undoubtedly, the tariff fears were likely overdone, and with so much damage already done to the stock, investors have more reason to be constructive, especially as the auto scene looks to start picking up again.\nWith a decent past quarter and enough management confidence to hike its guidance, I\u2019m inclined to start viewing MG shares as less of a value trap and more like a deep-value play. The stock trades at 11.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) or about an 8 times forward P/E. With a nice 4.2% dividend yield and the means to benefit greatly from a stronger Canadian dollar, I do think the path of least resistance might be higher in 2026.\nIndeed, a stronger Canadian dollar would help reduce input costs and add to the company\u2019s margins, which also stand to benefit from ongoing operating efficiency efforts.\nFortis\nFortis (TSX:FTS) is another Canadian stock that wouldn\u2019t mind a stronger loonie. Of course, the utility does business on both sides of the border. However, a stronger loonie would allow the firm a bit more purchasing power as it continues to embark on its capital expenditure plan. Not to mention a stronger loonie would make the U.S. dollar debt load seem even less hefty."

The pair has reached prices above the 200.00 level after bouncing at 199.55, but remains below a key resistance area ahead of 200.50\nData released on Thursday revealed that the advanced Tokyo CPI grew at a 2.5% yearly rate in September, down from 2.6% in August. The Core CPI remained steady at 2.5% against market expectations of an uptick to 2.6%. These figures give some more leeway to the BoJ to maintain its \u201cwait-and-see\u201d stance at its next monetary policy meeting, and have increased bearish pressure on the Yen.\nTechnical analysis: Looking for direction around 200.00\nThe technical picture is mixed. The pair broke below an ascending trendline support, yet bears have been unable to pull the pair below 199.20. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index is wavering around the 50 level, indicating a lack of a clear bias.\nBulls will find significant resistance in the area between Thursday\u2019s high, at 200.35, and the reverse trendline, now around 200.50. A confirmation above here would open the way towards the year-to-date high, at 201.27.\nA reversal from current levels, on the contrary, would face support at the mentioned 199.20 (September 19 and 23 lows). Further down, the 78.6% retracement of the September rally, which meets the September 5 low at 198.65, and the September 2 low at 198.35, would be the next bearish targets.\n(This story was corrected on September 26 at 10:10 GMT to say that the September 5 low is at 198.65 and the September 2 at 198.35, not at 168.65 and 1.1830 as previously reported.)\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

On September 24, BTC spot ETFs recorded $241 million in net inflows, led by BlackRock\u2019s iBIT with $129 million, pushing optimism back into the market. Just 24 hours later, however, sentiment flipped as ETFs bled $258.4 million in outflows, the sharpest reversal since August.

In parallel, lawmakers are lobbying the SEC to approve Trump\u2019s executive order allowing 401(k) retirement accounts \u2014 worth over $9 trillion \u2014 to allocate into Bitcoin.

                "body": "Cryptocurrency headlines can be tiresome. Who cares if Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) is worth $100,000 or $120,000 per coin, right? Both figures are enough to cover four years of college tuition, or buy a luxury car will all the bells and whistles (yes, even that one!). Sure, you can buy just a small fraction of a Bitcoin at a time, but it can be difficult to wrap your head around these large numbers.\nBut what if you could get exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside without dealing with those intimidating five- and six-figure price tags? Enter the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKB), trading at $37.75 per share on September 24, 2025.\nThat's enough for a nice dinner, not a tricked-out SUV. Let's use the lower stakes of ARKB shares to consider the value and risks of Bitcoin investments.\nSame Bitcoin exposure, friendlier price tag\nFor all intents and purposes, buying shares of ARKB is the same thing as buying Bitcoin directly. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest team is actually buying and selling Bitcoin to reflect the cash being invested in this fund. As an exchange-traded fund (ETF), ARKB brings a couple of small quirks to your Bitcoin investment:\nThere's a modest management fee with an annual expense ratio of 0.21%. It's a bit higher than the 0.01% expense ratios you see in Vanguard ETFs, but it's actually one of the lowest fees in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena.\nWhen Bitcoin prices go up, ARKB's chart will follow. The direct effect remains when the crypto chart is pointing down, too.\nBitcoin is the only holding in the single-asset ARKB fund's portfolio.\nWith $4.86 billion of (pure Bitcoin) assets under management, ARKB is one of the most popular and most liquid spot Bitcoin funds. Investors should have no problem completing trades in this fund at a fair price.\nThe fund currently holds roughly 42,744 Bitcoins in its portfolio, and offers investor access to these assets through 50.3 million ARKB shares. That's how ARKB can provide Bitcoin exposure at such modest share prices -- by dividing a large pie in lots and lots of smaller slices. ARKB will be worth $40 right after Bitcoin passes the $120,000 mark.\nWhy Bitcoin believers are still buying\nNow that you know what the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is, it's time for a more direct investing question. Is ARKB a buy below $40 per share, based on what's going on with the underlying Bitcoin market?\nWell, Bitcoin and related investments have been strong performers lately. These Bitcoin bets have approximately quintupled the 15.7% gains of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index over the last year:\nThat chart includes last November's election results, which brought a more crypto-friendly administration to Capitol Hill. Excluding that surge, Bitcoin's results have been comparable to the stock market in 2025. Generally speaking, the cryptocurrency tends to jump when the economy looks strong and fall when investors feel more pressure. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and many bulls make leveraged crypto investments with borrowed money. That's harder to do when interest rates are high, so macroeconomic moves have a direct impact on this sector.\nThe risks don't shrink with the share price, though\nIn a longer perspective, you have to weigh Bitcoin's potential gains against a plethora of unique risks. Bitcoin maximalists expect the \"digital gold\" to replace the U.S. dollar and physical gold as the preferred methods for storing and transferring money around the world. If that happens, the sky just might be the limit.\nARK Invest founder Cathie Wood and Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) chairman Michael Saylor both see million-dollar price tags for Bitcoin as early as the year 2030. That would translate into ARKB prices in the $850 range per share -- a massive return on your investment of less than $40. ARK Invest would probably split those shares several times before then, keeping the share price at a more digestible level.\nIf you agree with their ultra-optimistic views, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF certainly looks li"

If large holders continue to selectively take profits, it may point to a maturing market where strategic capital management takes precedence over pure speculation. On the other hand, the persistence of significant unrealized gains suggests that many whales remain optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, especially as regulatory clarity and institutional involvement increase. As Ethereum approaches important resistance levels, the balance between realized and unrealized gains is likely to remain a key focus for market watchers."

                "body": "Here we are in 2025, and guess what? Ethereum has snatched the crown back from Tron, becoming the top dog in USDT transfers. After two years of Tron's reign, this isn't just a number game; it's a whole paradigm shift in the crypto world. With institutional investors flocking to Ethereum, fintech startups need to catch up with the changing tides of stablecoin transactions. Let\u2019s dive into what this all means.\nEthereum Back on Top\nEthereum has pulled ahead with a whopping $23.7 billion in weekly USDT transfers, leaving Tron's $22 billion in the dust. This marks a significant shift in the stablecoin transfer landscape, which has been under Tron's thumb for a long while. The resurgence of Ethereum is largely thanks to new life in decentralized finance (DeFi). Protocols like Plasma, Morpho, and Maple have been luring in big bucks from institutional investors, and that\u2019s giving Ethereum a much-needed boost.\nSure, the stablecoin market thrives on low-cost and fast networks, and Ethereum has these, but its depth of ecosystem is proving to be a compelling factor. Institutions are engaging more with Ethereum, which is strengthening its transaction volume and hinting at a return of capital to Ethereum-based lending and borrowing. This all points to how crucial institutional confidence and regulatory clarity are for the future of stablecoin transactions.\nTron's Game Plan\nTron has long claimed the title of the go-to network for USDT movement because of its low fees and speedy transactions. This strategy has been a lifesaver, especially when Ethereum\u2019s gas fees were sky-high. But now with Ethereum back in the spotlight, Tron has had to pivot to stay relevant.\nJustin Sun, the man behind Tron, announced a 60% fee cut across the entire network to keep its user base intact. This is aimed at retaining both retail and institutional stablecoin users, especially during market swings. Tron has always banked on fee efficiency for its stablecoin circulation dominance, and this adjustment shows how it\u2019s trying to keep pace with competition while managing transaction scalability.\nThe Role of Institutions\nInstitutional investors are key players in Ethereum's resurgence in USDT transfers. Their adoption through large-scale, compliant investments, and preference for infrastructure is a stark contrast to Tron's low-fee, high-throughput focus. Ethereum's allure for institutional players is reinforced by its regulatory clarity and robust DeFi ecosystem, which are essential for large-scale asset management and treasury operations.\nAs more fintech startups embrace crypto payroll solutions, understanding how institutions play into this is vital. Ethereum's pull among these investors emphasizes compliance and security in the evolving crypto payments landscape. Startups need to adapt to these trends to fully utilize crypto payroll platforms and maintain their growth trajectory.\nThe DeFi Effect\nDeFi protocols are shaking up the stablecoin transfers landscape beyond just Ethereum and Tron. They\u2019re allowing cross-chain interoperability, liquidity aggregation, and multi-chain stablecoin swapping, broadening the scope for stablecoin transactions. With so many blockchain ecosystems, platforms are emerging to pool liquidity and trading options from various chains, enhancing stablecoin transfers in cost, speed, and security.\nAs DeFi continues to flourish, stablecoins are becoming essential in lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols across different chains. This surge in demand for efficient stablecoin transfers is pushing innovation in cross-chain bridges and multi-chain DeFi apps, ramping up the competition in this space.\nBest Practices for Crypto Treasury Management\nFor those fintech startups and SMEs looking to integrate crypto solutions, solid treasury management is a must. With the stablecoin payments landscape changing, businesses have to adopt strong compliance frameworks to navigate regulatory complexities. This includes understanding liquidity access, ope"

Also, the demand for Bitcoin DeFi is increasing in tandem with its price, and it is well known that developing within the Bitcoin network is challenging.\nDevelopers face significant limitations, including complex UTXO management, scaling bottlenecks, and a lack of practical DeFi products. According to the team at Zeus Network, the solution provides routes for integrating BTC trading pairs through tokenized assets, such as zBTC, allowing users to participate in borrowing, lending, and yield strategies via familiar Solana interfaces.\nThe kit addresses specific issues cited by developers: missing users, infrastructure gaps, and liquidity constraints. BitcoinKit interfaces range from single-line widgets for instant wallet support to comprehensive SDKs for enterprise adoption, removing technical hurdles for projects seeking to bridge Bitcoin and Solana environments.\nModular Architecture Expands Developer Options\nWith BitcoinKit, decentralized exchanges, wallets, and BTC-native experiences can gain modular integration paths. Developers can launch BTC-native DeFi protocols, add tokenized BTC balances, facilitate cross-chain routes using Zeus Reserve, and distribute BTC-based rewards. This flexible architecture aims to replace broken and limited legacy solutions, simplifying the onboarding of both new and existing users onto Solana-powered Bitcoin applications.\nZeus Network positions BitcoinKit as a catalyst for building a self-sustaining DeFi ecosystem around Bitcoin, offering infrastructure that matches project scope and user needs. By supporting plug-and-play integration modules, the kit helps developers reach broader audiences and unlock the liquidity traditionally trapped in siloed Bitcoin wallets.\nWorth mentioning that this launch doesn\u2019t generate a lot of movement in the price of the ZEUS token, according to our price aggregator. Even though the cost of the token is following the crypto market, with a 10.14% drop in its prices over the last week.\nGrowing Bitcoin DeFi Demand Outpaces Mixed Token Performance\nThe launch underscores Zeus Network\u2019s commitment to driving the adoption of programmable Bitcoin on Solana, aiming to deliver scalable, secure, and user-friendly tools for a new wave of cross-chain DeFi applications."

He wrote at top outlets like CriptoNoticias, BeInCrypto, and CoinDesk. Specializing in Bitcoin, blockchain, and Web3, he creates news, analysis, and educational content for global audiences in both Spanish and English.\nKey Notes\n- BitcoinKit provides comprehensive solutions for Bitcoin's DeFi integration challenges including UTXO management and scaling issues.\n- The modular architecture enables developers to build BTC-native protocols with tokenized assets like zBTC for lending and trading.\n- Bitcoin DeFi demand surged 2,000% in 2024 while ZEUS token dropped 10.14% despite the product launch announcement.\nZeus Network has launched BitcoinKit, a developer kit designed to connect Bitcoin with the Solana ecosystem, addressing several persistent barriers to Bitcoin\u2019s use in decentralized finance (DeFi). The initiative introduces modular tools that enable projects to unlock programmable Bitcoin features on Solana, aiming to boost accessibility and utility for DeFi platforms.\nDeveloper Kit Solves Bitcoin DeFi\u2019s Biggest Roadblocks\nBitcoinKit\u2019s release comes at a time when Bitcoin infrastructure is fragmented, and available tooling is outdated. Also, the demand for Bitcoin DeFi is increasing in tandem with its price, and it is well known that developing within the Bitcoin network is challenging.\nDevelopers face significant limitations, including complex UTXO management, scaling bottlenecks, and a lack of practical DeFi products. According to the team at Zeus Network, the solution provides routes for integrating BTC trading pairs through tokenized assets, such as zBTC, allowing users to participate in borrowing, lending, and yield strategies via familiar Solana interfaces.\nIntroducing BitcoinKit \u2013 Powered by @ZeusNetworkHQ\nTurn Bitcoin into programmable money and tap directly into $2T of BTC liquidity, no corporate gatekeepers required.\nLearn more \u2193 pic.twitter.com/ZdRKSIi52G\n\u2014 BitcoinKit \u2013 Powered by Zeus (@BitcoinKitDev) September 26, 2025\nThe kit addresses specific issues cited by developers: missing users, infrastructure gaps, and liquidity constraints. BitcoinKit interfaces range from single-line widgets for instant wallet support to comprehensive SDKs for enterprise adoption, removing technical hurdles for projects seeking to bridge Bitcoin and Solana environments.\nModular Architecture Expands Developer Options\nWith BitcoinKit, decentralized exchanges, wallets, and BTC-native experiences can gain modular integration paths. Developers can launch BTC-native DeFi protocols, add tokenized BTC balances, facilitate cross-chain routes using Zeus Reserve, and distribute BTC-based rewards. This flexible architecture aims to replace broken and limited legacy solutions, simplifying the onboarding of both new and existing users onto Solana-powered Bitcoin applications.\nZeus Network positions BitcoinKit as a catalyst for building a self-sustaining DeFi ecosystem around Bitcoin, offering infrastructure that matches project scope and user needs. By supporting plug-and-play integration modules, the kit helps developers reach broader audiences and unlock the liquidity traditionally trapped in siloed Bitcoin wallets.\nWorth mentioning that this launch doesn\u2019t generate a lot of movement in the price of the ZEUS token, according to our price aggregator. Even though the cost of the token is following the crypto market, with a 10.14% drop in its prices over the last week.\nGrowing Bitcoin DeFi Demand Outpaces Mixed Token Performance\nThe launch underscores Zeus Network\u2019s commitment to driving the adoption of programmable Bitcoin on Solana, aiming to deliver scalable, secure, and user-friendly tools for a new wave of cross-chain DeFi applications.\nMeanwhile, the price of Bitcoin BTC $109 527 24h volatility: 0.1% Market cap: $2.18 T Vol. 24h: $59.38 B continues to rise, and as a result, demand for a DeFi ecosystem is also increasing.

                "body": "Stock Market Today: Dow Gains +0.33%; S&P 500 and Nasdaq Fall\nIn the latest market update, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a modest gain of 0.33%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite saw declines. This mixed performance illustrates the volatility and complexity of the current economic landscape, influenced by various factors including corporate earnings reports, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions.\nOverview of Major Index Performance\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, a price-weighted index that includes 30 significant publicly traded companies in the United States, rose by 0.33%. This increase reflects gains in several key sectors, particularly in industrials and consumer staples. Companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and UnitedHealth Group contributed to this upward movement, showcasing resilience in consumer demand despite broader economic uncertainties. Investors in the Dow may find comfort in the index\u2019s relative stability compared to its peers, especially as it comprises established companies with a history of steady performance.\nS&P 500\nThe S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S., fell during the trading session. This decline highlights the challenges faced by technology and healthcare sectors, which are often influential in determining the index\u2019s overall performance. Notably, stocks from major tech firms like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. weighed heavily on the index, as they continue to grapple with rising costs and the potential for slower growth due to tightening monetary policy. Investors are particularly cautious as companies navigate a challenging economic environment, leading to increased volatility in stock prices.\nNasdaq Composite\nThe Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy weighting in technology stocks, also experienced a downturn. The fall in the Nasdaq can be attributed to a combination of rising interest rates, which tend to impact tech stocks more severely, and ongoing concerns regarding inflation. As the Federal Reserve continues its monetary policy tightening, technology shares remain under pressure, with many investors reassessing their growth forecasts. The combination of external economic pressures and internal corporate performance has created a challenging climate for the tech-heavy index.\nFactors Influencing Market Movements\nEconomic Indicators\nEconomic indicators play a significant role in shaping market performance. Recent reports on inflation rates and employment figures have raised concerns among investors. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data pointed to persistent inflation, which could lead to further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Such actions typically exert downward pressure on stock prices, as higher rates can slow consumer spending and corporate investment. The unemployment rate also remains a crucial metric, with any fluctuations sending ripples through market confidence.\nCorporate Earnings\nEarnings season is critical for stock market movements, and recent quarterly reports have shown mixed results. Some companies exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, while others failed to deliver, leading to volatility in their respective stock prices. For instance, tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings, leading to short-term spikes in their stock prices. Conversely, companies in the retail sector, such as Walmart Inc., faced challenges due to supply chain disruptions and increased operational costs. Investors are closely monitoring these earnings releases to gauge the overall health of the economy, as they provide insight into sectors that are performing well and those that are struggling.\nGeopolitical Tensions\nGeopolitical events also significantly influence market sentiment. Recent developments in global trade relations, including tensions between major economies, have introduced uncertainty into the markets. The ongoing"

Tech stocks weighed heavily on the market, with Oracle slipping 5% and Tesla down 4%. CarMax tumbled 20% after posting weak earnings, while Intel surged 9% on reports it had approached Apple regarding an investment.\nUS stocks faced challenges as solid economic data from the United States (US) may prompt the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to adopt a more cautious approach to deliver deeper interest rate cuts. US Initial Jobless Claims declined to 218K last week, the lowest since July. The market expectations were an increase to 235K from 232K previously.\nThe US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Annualized grew 3.8% in the second quarter (Q2), coming in above the previous estimate and the estimation of 3.3%. Meanwhile, the GDP Price Index rose 2.1% in the same period, as compared to the expected and previous 2.0% growth.\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade the DJIA. One is to use ETFs which allow investors to trade the DJIA as a single security, rather than having to buy shares in all 30 constituent companies. A leading example is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). DJIA futures contracts enable traders to speculate on the future value of the index and Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the index at a predetermined price in the future. Mutual funds enable investors to buy a share of a"

                "body": "4 Reasons for Q4 to Start on a Strong Note: ETFs to Play\nThe S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones \u2014 all hit all-time highs this year, having gained about 12.5%, 16.1% and 8.4%, respectively, so far this year (as of Sept. 25, 2025). But the fourth quarter may see even higher gains as it includes the all-important holiday season.\nThe fourth quarter of the year has actually been the best for the stock market. Over the past three decades, dated back to 1989, the Dow Jones (4.3%), the S&P (3.6%) and the Nasdaq (4.7%) posted gains in the fourth quarter, according to Kensho, and traded positively 75-80% of the time, per a CNBC article issued in 2019.\nLet\u2019s find out what factors can hold up well for the stock market this fourth quarter.\nUpbeat U.S. GDP Growth\nThanks to stronger consumer spending, the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly robust 3.8% pace in Q2 of 2025, marking an upward revision of second-quarter growth released by the government.\nThe Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product (GDP) bounced back in the spring after a 0.6% decline in the first quarter, which had been hit hard by trade tensions. The new estimate is higher than the previously reported 3.3% growth (per AP news, as quoted on Yahoo Finance).\nAll-Important Holiday Season\nThe fourth quarter embraces an all-important holiday season, and consumers tend to make solid discretionary purchases this time of the year. Note that consumer spending rose at a 2.5% clip in Q2, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and way higher than the 1.6% that the government had previously estimated.\nThis shows that the consumer spending pattern remains decently strong, which calls for a strong holiday season this year. This is especially true given that the Fed has started cutting interest rates from September 2025 to boost a weakening labor market. Market experts are anticipating further cuts this year, which should boost consumer spending even further.\nHost of AI Deals Announced in September\nWhile some market experts are concerned about the payoffs of huge investments being made in artificial intelligence (AI), the pace of AI investments is showing no sign of abating. NVIDIA has announced investment plans in OpenAI (worth up to $100 billion). Meanwhile, NVIDIA announced a $5 billion investment in Intel. There has been a deal announced between Alibaba and NVIDIA (per RTT news).\nCoreWeave announced an agreement with OpenAI to power the training of its most advanced next-generation models. Intel has reportedly approached Apple for an investment to fund its rebound, as quoted on Bloomberg. In short, the month has seen mega-deals in the AI space, which ensures that the AI boom is in fine fettle and should be able to drive Wall Street in the coming months.\nAlso, there have been deals in quantum computing. Among the notable ones, IonQ announced its intent to acquire Vector Atomic. Rigetti announced a three-year contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Meanwhile, Trump and Britain joined forces on advancing AI, quantum computing and nuclear technologies (read: Here's Why Semiconductor ETFs Are Hitting 52-Week Highs).\nEarnings Strength\nAs we have consistently highlighted in recent weeks, the overall revisions trend of the S&P 500 earnings estimates remains positive, with estimates for the back half of the year steadily going up. For 2025 Q3, total S&P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 5.2% from the same period last year on 6.0% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends. However, barring the Tech sector contribution, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be up only 2.2% (vs. 5.2% otherwise).\nETF Picks\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETFs that could be great picks for Q4.\niShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM \u2013 Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)\nSmall caps have gained momentum lately on Fed rate cut hopes and the upbeat GDP outlook provided by the Fed.

A Bank of England official signaled that interest rate cuts could come slower than markets expect, adding more pressure on sectors sensitive to borrowing costs. Medical equipment stocks dipped after the US launched new national security reviews of imported health products, sending Convatec down over 6%. Construction stocks followed their European peers lower, and Mitchells & Butlers fell as sales growth slowed. On the flip side, Petershill Partners soared more than 33% after announcing plans to delist from London due to lackluster valuations. The day\u2019s winners were industrial miners like Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which rallied as copper prices hit a 15-month high \u2013 a bullish sign for global demand.

Sectors like healthcare and construction are under strain, while Petershill's decision to leave the London Stock Exchange highlights ongoing challenges for local capital markets. But it\u2019s not all bleak \u2013 commodity-driven sectors are outperforming as global demand props up prices, with mining stocks enjoying strong gains thanks to copper\u2019s surge.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks hold the keys to recovery.\nThe UK\u2019s persistent inflation is setting it apart from other major economies and forcing the Bank of England to move slowly on rate cuts.

(Reuters File)\nShare\nNEW YORK \u2014 Steady U.S. inflation data reassured Wall Street, leading to gains on Friday while Treasury yields stayed largely flat and gold firmed on expectations the Federal Reserve may continue cutting interest rates this year.\nU.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in August while the inflation rate rose to 2.7% from 2.6% in July, in line with economists\u2019 expectations.\nConcerns continued to percolate around fresh White House tariffs on pharmaceuticals which had weighed on Asian bourses and put pressure on the dollar.\nPrice pressure is still to come, Citigroup\u2019s global chief economist Nathan Sheets said.\n\u201cFirms aggressively accumulated inventories during the first half of the year, and this has given them scope to delay price increases. But that process is now playing through,\u201d Sheets said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.70%, the S&P 500 rose 0.46% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.18%.\nPresident Donald Trump imposed new 100% duties on imported branded drugs as well as new tariffs on goods ranging from trucks to kitchen cabinets on Thursday, in a move that again raised the specter of a trade war and complicated the inflation forecasts.\nEli Lilly shares rose 1.7%. Truck maker Paccar, which manufactures most of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, gained 4.4% to top the S&P 500.\nNot Falling off a Cliff\nFriday\u2019s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index functions as a key component of the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation outlook.\nU.S. Treasury yields, which influence borrowing costs, moved little after the data was released.\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 0.9 basis points to 4.183%, from 4.174% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield fell 0.1 basis points to 4.7516% from 4.753% late on Thursday.\n\u201cThe one bright spot was that income and spending were a little bit firmer than expected, which means the consumer isn\u2019t falling off a cliff as the market was expecting,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities.\nGold, a safe haven which usually benefits from lower interest rates, firmed and spot prices were last quoted 0.54% higher at $3,769.05 an ounce.\nInvestors now estimate an 85.5% probability of a rate cut in October and a 62% chance of another in December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows.\nThe Fed made its first interest rate cut of the year last week, and signaled further easing was to come. Treasury yields rose in spite of that.\nThis week, they declined after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave few hints as to when cuts would come and emphasized the delicate balance facing the U.S. central bank.\nRichmond Fed Bank President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg Television that tariffs meant he had very low confidence in inflation forecasts right now. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman speaks later on Friday.\n\u2014\n(Reporting by Naomi Rovnick.

                "body": "Key Facts:\n- Three-Day Slide: U.S. stocks fell for a third straight session on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.5% to 22,384.70 [1] (Nasdaq-100 similarly dipped), erasing record highs set earlier in the week [2]. The S&P 500 and Dow also declined ~0.5% and 0.4% respectively [3] amid broad profit-taking in equities.\n- Hot Economic Data vs. Rate Cuts: Surprisingly strong U.S. economic reports \u2013 including an upward revision of Q2 GDP growth to +3.8% (from 3.3%) and a drop in weekly jobless claims to 218,000 [4] [5] \u2013 cast doubt on how aggressively the Federal Reserve will ease policy. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to ~4.17% and the U.S. dollar index hit a one-week high near 98.5 [6] [7], underscoring expectations that interest rates may stay higher for longer.\n- Tech Winners and Losers: The tech sector saw mixed fortunes. Intel stock surged ~9% to lead the Nasdaq after reports that the chipmaker is seeking strategic investments \u2013 including a potential stake from Apple \u2013 to bolster its foundry business [8]. In contrast, Oracle shares tumbled ~5% after a Wall Street firm issued a rare \u201cSell\u201d rating on the stock, sparking a third day of declines [9]. Tesla also slid over 4% amid profit-taking and rising EV competition, while Apple fell nearly 2% on valuation concerns [10] [11].\n- Earnings Highlights: Several Nasdaq-listed companies reported results. Retail giant Costco beat expectations with fiscal Q4 earnings of $5.87 per share on $86 billion in revenue, up ~9% year-over-year [12]. CarMax, however, plunged 20% \u2013 the S&P\u2019s worst performer \u2013 after the used-car retailer\u2019s quarterly profit and sales badly missed estimates [13]. Consulting firm Accenture topped revenue forecasts but its stock fell ~3% on cautious guidance [14], and Micron Technology posted record chip sales yet saw shares drop 3% as the post-AI-boom enthusiasm cooled [15].\n- Tariff Shocks Hit Pharma: In a surprise move, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs to take effect Oct. 1 \u2013 including 100% duties on imported branded pharmaceutical drugs, a 25% tariff on heavy trucks, and 30\u201350% tariffs on categories like kitchen cabinets and furniture [16] [17]. The news rattled global markets: Asian pharmaceutical stocks tumbled (Japan\u2019s pharma index \u20131.2%, Hong Kong\u2019s biotech index \u20132%) [18], and industry analysts noted that details on exemptions remain scarce.\n- Fed\u2019s Mixed Signals: Federal Reserve officials struck a cautious tone in public remarks. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he\u2019s uneasy about cutting rates \u201ctoo quickly\u201d with inflation still above target, despite supporting last week\u2019s rate cut [19]. Conversely, newly appointed Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued the economy is vulnerable and urged sharper rate cuts to avert a labor market \u201ccollapse\u201d [20]. Traders responded by trimming bets on further easing \u2013 futures now imply slightly fewer rate reductions by year-end than a week ago [21].\n- Market Outlook: Investors are looking ahead to Friday\u2019s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2013 as a next crucial signal [22]. With another key U.S. jobs report due next week, many analysts expect continued market volatility. \u201cThe economic data\u2026calls into question how much the Fed may cut rates again this year,\u201d noted Peter Tuz of Chase Investment Counsel [23]. Still, bulls argue that easing price pressures or a gentle Fed could rekindle the tech rally, as \u201cone big positive is it seems like the government is going to let big tech get bigger,\u201d said Rick Meckler of Cherry Lane Investments [24].\nNasdaq and Indexes Retreat from Highs\nWall Street\u2019s momentum faltered in the latter half of this week, with the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 both posting their third straight daily loss on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 22,384.70 (down 0.5%), and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also fell around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively [25]. These declines marked a sharp reversal from Monday, when"

Sign up for it here.\nThe ascent of MAHA\u2014the Trump administration\u2019s movement to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d\u2014is part of a broader health revolution in the United States, one that venerates the past in order to carve out a purportedly healthier future. It has had mixed results; some MAHA tenets have little basis in medical literature (researchers pushed back on the White House\u2019s announcement this week that Tylenol use during pregnancy could be linked to autism). In today\u2019s Daily, my colleague Elizabeth Bruenig joins me for a conversation about her new article, \u201cWhen Child Death Was Everywhere,\u201d and the philosophy of the man behind the movement, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nWill Gottsegen: How does the ideology of conservatism explain what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is trying to do with health policy?\nElizabeth Bruenig: When you think of conservatism, you\u2019re thinking basically of someone who wants to conserve. William F. Buckley Jr. said the conservative disposition \u201cstands athwart history, yelling Stop.\u201d I think that helps explain why RFK Jr., who was a lifelong liberal, wound up on the conservative side of things. He, like a lot of conservatives, feels that the answer to human health and happiness lies somewhere in the past. It\u2019s a kind of nostalgia that drives what he\u2019s doing.\nWill: Wasn\u2019t that nostalgia for a supposedly healthier time once the province of the left?\nLiz: Vaccine skepticism was for a long time associated with the left, because it was associated with people who were skeptical of Western medicine or had a kind of \u201cback to the earth\u201d belief system that advocated holistic treatments and rejected modern pharmacology. Over time, anti-vax sentiment became more bipartisan, and then, after COVID, it just exploded on the right without exploding on the left.\nWill: Americans\u2019 trust in institutions such as HHS and the CDC declined majorly after COVID, on the right and the left. Is that how you wind up with someone as skeptical of the medical establishment as RFK Jr.?\nLiz: I think it\u2019s how you wind up with so many people who are interested in RFK Jr.\u2019s message. RFK Jr. was already anti-vax by the time the pandemic came around, but what COVID changed is it created so many people who had serious doubts about our institutions. And I think that explains why you have so many people at this point who are willing to listen to an anti-vax message.\nWill: You describe a lot of what RFK Jr. is doing as an unwinding of old policies, or a vision of return to an earlier era. What are the wrongs he\u2019s looking to right? And is there a way in which he\u2019s reacting to specific policies?\nLiz: RFK Jr., if you look at his career, is someone who has focused on the purity of nature: protecting the purity of natural resources, clean water, protecting pristine natural sites from industrial pollution. So I think his view on vaccines and processed foods is all of a piece with everything else he\u2019s done to try to keep things pure and natural. I do think that he is responding to the CDC\u2019s actions during COVID. A lot of people wound up very disillusioned with the lockdowns, with the mask mandates, and so on. And RFK Jr. is very much capitalizing on that mistrust people developed of the CDC.\nWill: To what extent is this broad skepticism now self-sustaining? Will we even need RFK Jr. to keep the wheels turning?\nLiz: I\u2019m afraid that we won\u2019t. At this point, it\u2019s become part of the belief system of the right, especially the MAGA right\u2014just like how post\u2013Donald Trump, we\u2019ll still be dealing in some sense with the MAGA movement, because it\u2019s changed how conservatives think about politics. We will still see right-wing anti-vax sentiment even afte"

                "body": "It took relentless fervor and no-holds-barred tactics to save the northern spotted owl, and the giant redwoods it called home. Activists disabled bulldozers, chained themselves to trees, drove spikes into the redwood trunks to thwart saws, and used bike locks to handcuff themselves to logging access gates. For symbolic effect, they also dressed as owls while issuing Native American\u2013inspired war cries.\nAfter a three-month blaze of publicity, the Redwood Summer campaign of 1990 helped lead to the protection of California\u2019s old-growth forests, safeguarding the owls\u2019 habitat, and contributed in casting the Pacific Lumber Company, a subsidiary in the portfolio of a Texas hedge fund magnate, into ignominy.\nStefanie Penn Spear, now 57, was once a young activist involved in the protests, and has brought a seemingly similar mission to the headquarters of the US Department of Health and Human Services: guarding her boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., against internal and external attack with the same man-the-barricades zeal that worked so well in the Pacific Northwest.\nFrom the suite of offices on the sixth floor of the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, Kennedy, a longtime vaccine antagonist, is on a stated mission to Make America Healthy Again. But now, seven months into his tenure, many physicians and scientists view him as an existential threat to public health, degrading the nation\u2019s vaccine infrastructure, slashing investments in critical scientific research, promoting treatments that have little proven efficacy, and maligning expert staff within US health agencies. To his many MAHA adherents, Kennedy, the perennially tanned descendant of Democratic royalty, is a self-avowed warrior in the fight against corporate corruption and a would-be progressive change agent in the right-wing Trump ecosystem\u2014a mission that\u2019s made him an endangered species, of sorts.\nAs his principal deputy chief of staff and senior counselor, Spear works from an office that connects to Kennedy\u2019s suite through a door behind his desk. Spear has created, says a former HHS staffer, \u201cthis huge wall around him.\u201d She is on seemingly constant watch to protect and shield him from disloyalty. In Kennedy\u2019s seven months at the agency, heads have rolled\u2014including even some brought in to further the MAHA agenda. Spear has remained a constant.\nSpear now sits at the liminal center of the current MAHA movement: a marriage of convenience that has yoked together the lefty wellness fringe, the vaccine-mandate-rejecting flank on the right, and the more mainstream MAGA GOP, happy to remove petroleum-based food dye from Froot Loops if it helps Republicans retain control of statehouses.\nKennedy and Spear\u2019s professional relationship goes back at least 15 years. In their short time at HHS, they have left a consistent impression on those around them: \u201ctethered,\u201d \u201cbolted together,\u201d \u201cattached at the hip,\u201d \u201cinseparable.\u201d Their alliance is \u201cuntouchable,\u201d one former White House official observes.\nThis assessment has taken on significant weight in recent months, as Spear has come into the crosshairs of Laura Loomer, the MAGA activist who has demonstrated particular sway with President Trump on personnel matters. Loomer has denounced Spear to her 1.8 million followers on X, calling her a \u201cradical left\u201d appointee. In the wake of Loomer\u2019s August attacks, Kennedy used his official X account to defend Spear to his 1.1 million followers, describing her as a \u201cfierce, loyal warrior for MAHA\u201d who \u201cworks every day to advance President Trump\u2019s vision for a healthier, stronger America.\u201d\nA number of her former colleagues are aghast that Spear, the onetime eco-activist, has joined the drill-baby-drill Trump administration. Little more than a decade ago, she was denouncing the Keystone XL pipeline in a panel discussion sponsored by a Marxist opinion site, People\u2019s World. Her consulting firm helped install renewable-energy infrastructure such as windmills, a particular b\u00eate noire for Trump. \u201cIt is fucking mind-blowing,\u201d"

The broader Topix index rose by 1.67 points, or 0.05%, to 3,187.02 points, marking its third consecutive day of record highs. #JapanMarket#\nIn the main board market, the sectors that saw significant declines were non-ferrous metals and electrical stocks, while real estate and food stocks performed notably well, becoming prominent gainers.\nUS President Trump announced a 100% tariff on imported branded or patented drugs starting October 1, eliciting varied market reactions.\nThe pharmaceuticals sector was one of the worst-performing among the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s 33 industry segments, declining by 1.4%. Chugai Pharmaceutical\u2019s shares plummeted by 4.8%, Sumitomo Pharma fell by 3.5%, Otsuka Holdings dropped by 2.9%, although Takeda Pharmaceutical only slipped by 0.1%, while Shionogi rose by 1%.\nJefferies analyst Stephen Barker stated that while he believed Trump's announcement was unlikely to have a 'heavy' tariff impact on Japan\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, investors naturally could not ignore the potential risks.\nBarker noted that the divergence in performance between Sumitomo Pharma and Takeda Pharmaceutical might stem from their communication strategies.\n\"Takeda Pharmaceutical has been actively promoting that most of its products sold in the US are locally manufactured,\" he said. \"Whereas Sumitomo Pharma has been less transparent, with suspicions that they export drugs from Switzerland.\"\nAdditionally, market traders noted that rising US Treasury yields, coupled with upward revisions to US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates again in the near term, keeping the dollar above 149 yen in Tokyo trading.\nThe Nikkei index was weighed down by heavyweight semiconductor-related and artificial intelligence-linked stocks, which had seen substantial gains recently.\nAdditionally, the market was affected by an overnight decline in U.S. stocks, and weaker-than-expected initial jobless claims also diminished expectations for further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve.\nHowever, the market was supported by a weaker yen, with the currency's depreciation increasing the repatriated overseas profits of exporters. Analysts noted that sectors linked to domestic demand, such as real estate and food, have also drawn investor interest after lagging in performance previously.\nYuta Okamoto, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, stated that while the stock market is primarily influenced by the U.S. market, the upcoming leadership election of the ruling party has sparked optimism about new economic policies, which could propel further gains in Japan's stock market."

                "body": "Shigeru Fujimoto, dubbed \"Japan's Warren Buffett,\" starts his day at 2 a.m. every day even at the age of 89. First, the US stock market will be checked with the US-Japan joint economic channel \"Nikkei CNBC.\" At four o'clock in the morning, I read the Nikkei newspaper and check the items to buy and sell that day. After breakfast and a quick walk, battle the chart until 3 p.m. when the market ends. Recurring transaction details and achievements by hand is also essential.\nFujimoto has been living this war-like life for 70 years. His assets are increasing since he started with a 'dirt spoon' without a penny. The assets, which were 1.8 billion yen (about 17 billion won) when the Japanese version of the book was released for the first time in 2023, are on the verge of surpassing 2.4 billion yen (about 22.7 billion won) this year. Shigeru earned nearly 6 billion won in two years, but he is still thirsty. In a recent interview with Maeil Economy, he said, \"I want to earn more than 1 billion yen. \"If the rest of my life allows it, it's fully possible,\" he said, expressing his will.\nThe secret to Fujimoto's ability to become a legendary investor, born as the son of a poor farmer, is \"steadiness.\" He first began stocking in 1955 at the age of 19. It was a time when transactions were concluded with a receiver because there was no electronic system. There was no mentor around to see and learn. He had no choice but to gain experience by studying events and companies as if he was heading to the ground. As I built up my skills like that, it became a guru for Japanese investors. \"On the contrary, it means that anyone can become rich if they try,\" Fujimoto said. \"Those who endure stocks and life laugh.\"\nIn fact, for 70 years, Fujimoto has faced countless crises. In particular, the assets of 1 billion yen (about 9.4 billion won) during the Black Monday incident in 1987 were cut to 200 million yen (about 1.9 billion won) in an instant. Many investors left the market in the shock, but Fujimoto was calm. He did not let go of his investment and study, saying, \"It is a waste of time to be gloomy.\"\nThen, what is Fujimoto's most important investment principle. Fujimoto stressed several times, \"You have to choose stocks that increase sales, increase profits, and increase dividends.\" They say that they need to develop an eye to choose the currently undervalued stocks among the stocks that will grow steadily for a long time. Next, he added, approach the sports you like or know well. In fact, Fujimoto is trading more than 80 items mainly for his favorite automobiles and semiconductors.\nThis is also in line with Buffett's investment principle, a \"legend of value investment.\" Buffett also emphasizes that \u2460 invest long-term mainly in areas that have high internal value and \u2461 know well. In other words, there is a difference between short-term and long-term holdings, but in the end, both investment legends send a message that there is no shortcut on the way to becoming rich.\nTo this end, Fujimoto introduced the \"one-to-two-to-six law.\" Judging by various indicators, it is an investment method in which 1,000 shares are first bought for decent stocks, followed by 2,000 and 6,000 shares in order according to the degree of confidence. Fujimoto explains that if you trade in this way, you can stably manage risks and earn profits even in the market with high uncertainty. One of the most commonly used indicators is RSI (relative intensity index). He also said that if the RSI is less than 30%, it is judged to be over-selling, and if it is more than 70%, it is over-buying.\nHowever, Fujimoto also warned, \"Don't even think about buying it at the lowest point and selling it at the highest point.\" \"Stocks are a battle against their own desires,\" he said, \"I've seen too many cases of raising losses after being optimistic that stock prices will rise further and that they will rise again if they fall.\" To avoid this, he stressed that it is better to give up your head and tail f"
