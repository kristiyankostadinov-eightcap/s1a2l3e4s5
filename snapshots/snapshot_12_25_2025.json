                "body": "The S&P 500 closed up 0.46% yesterday to hit a new record of 6,909.79. The index is now up 17.48% for the year. With only the quiet Christmas week left before the end of 2025, it\u2019s likely that investors will mark this down in their spreadsheets as a very good year.\nUnless, of course, they have a friend who bought gold at the beginning of 2025.\nThe price of gold is up an astonishing 71% year to date, and is currently hovering around $4,514 per troy ounce. That friend is now laughing at you, foolish stock investor, for wasting your money on trivialities like the Magnificent Seven.\nThere\u2019s a hackneyed narrative explaining why gold went up: We had a volatile year with President Trump\u2019s tariffs disrupting global trade; Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine; concern about a bubble in AI-related tech stocks; Bitcoin went nowhere this year (it\u2019s down 7%); inflation is trending up; and gold is the safe-haven investment for nervous investors who want a hedge against pretty much all of that.\nIn fact, that is only partially true, according to newish research from Claude Erb and Campbell Harvey of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. The reality, they say, is that the introduction in 2004 of gold exchange-traded funds\u2014which make buying gold as easy as buying stocks\u2014has permanently pushed up the price of gold.\n\u201cTotal North American gold ETFs have almost $200 billion, and ETFs outside the U.S. account for another $175 billion in gold,\u201d they said in an October 2025 research paper.\nThis chart shows the apparent effect on the price of gold following the introduction of gold ETFs. The chart shows the \u201creal\u201d price of gold, which adjusts its price for inflation:\nThe more recent introduction of tokenized gold stablecoins\u2014crypto tokens backed by gold reserves and thus pegged to the price of gold, which can be \u201cstaked\u201d or locked up as investments in other risk assets like bonds\u2014is likely to push the price up further, they say.\nBut don\u2019t get too excited.\nGold isn\u2019t actually a great hedge against inflation over the long run, Erb and Harvey argue. The price of gold has high volatility, whereas inflation is a low-volatility phenomenon. Gold investors can spend years losing money if they are trying to beat inflation:\nAnd then there\u2019s the performance of gold generally, in nominal dollars, versus stocks. This chart shows the price of gold over the past 40 years. Note that gold can spend years and years in long-term price declines:\nAnd here is the Comex continuous contract for gold versus the S&P 500 index over the past 20 years.\nClearly, the winner ain\u2019t gold:\nSo has gold peaked? No one knows, obviously. But it is interesting that investment banks like Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Morgan Stanley, and Mitsui have all expanded their precious metal trading teams this year, while other banks are exploring getting back into the \u201cvault\u201d business of storing gold reserves, the Financial Times reports.\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:\n- S&P 500 futures were flat this morning. The last session closed up 0.46% to hit a new record of 6,909.79.\n- The STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.39% in early trading.\n- The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 0.12% in early trading.\n- Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 was down 0.14%.\n- China\u2019s CSI 300 was up 0.29%.\n- The South Korea KOSPI was down 0.21%.\n- India\u2019s Nifty 50 was down 0.14%.\n- Bitcoin was at $87K."

                "body": "What is the silver price forecast for 2026?\nLike gold, silver experienced a powerful upswing in 2025, one that caught the attention of both seasoned precious metals investors and newcomers looking for alternatives to volatile equity markets. While silver doesn't command the same four-figure price tag per ounce as gold, its percentage gains have been remarkable nonetheless. The metal entered 2025 at roughly $30 per ounce and surged to about $70 per troy ounce by late December, more than doubling in value over the course of the year.\nThis rapid acceleration reflects more than just investor enthusiasm. A combination of inflation pressures, supply constraints, geopolitical uncertainty and rising industrial demand all contributed to silver's sharp climb. At the same time, the Federal Reserve's late-2025 rate cuts helped fuel broader interest in hard assets, giving silver another tailwind. With the metal now sitting near historic highs, many investors are trying to determine whether silver still has room to run or if a cooling period is more likely.\nTo help answer that, we spoke with precious metal experts about what could push silver higher, what might cause a pullback and what conditions might lead to price stability in the year ahead. Here's what they say investors should watch closely as the new year approaches.\nFind out how you can add silver and gold to your investment portfolio now.\nWhat's the silver price forecast for 2026? Experts weigh in.\nWe spoke with gold and silver investment experts about silver price forecasts and what investors might see in 2026.\nWhat needs to happen for silver prices to increase in 2026\nHigh or rising inflation generally means rising silver prices as costs increase, explains Peter Reagan, Birch Gold Group financial market strategist. And, while inflation has been cooling recently, the reality is that the current inflation rate is still sitting above its 2% target, meaning that inflationary uncertainty still looms as we head into 2026. That, in turn, could impact the price of silver.\n\"Inflationary pressures are likely to keep rising, making it harder for people to plan for retirement,\" Reagan says. \"For silver specifically, while nothing is guaranteed, rising economic uncertainty and continued inflation suggest we could see both higher prices and stronger demand in the new year.\"\nSilver's price will likely continue to see increases in 2026, Joshua D. Glawson, content manager for Money Metals Exchange, says, especially as the demand for other investment vehicles like precious metals exchange-traded funds and bonds increases.\n\"ETFs are creating more 'demand' than there is actual physical metal above ground. And some countries' governments are now promoting these silver ETFs, which are driving up the price of silver futures and silver spot price,\" Glawson says. \"My prediction, although I cannot tell the future, is that the price of silver is going to continue to rise in 2026.\"\nLearn more about the benefits of precious metal investing here.\nWhat needs to happen for silver prices to drop in 2026\nHowever, if the Federal Reserve conducts any rate hikes in 2026, silver prices will likely drop, experts say. A higher rate environment causes yields to rise on other investment vehicles, such as high-yield savings accounts. And, investors may prefer the liquidity and higher rates offered by these investments over the volatile nature of silver, reducing demand for the metal.\nA constricting U.S. economy and global manufacturing slowdown could also cause silver prices to slow down and decrease in 2026, Henry Yoshida, CFP, CEO and cofounder of Rocket Dollar, says. So, investors should watch for lower consumer and industrial demand, especially as tariffs restrict imports and drive up prices on goods.\n\"Investors should watch the three metrics that influence silver prices: real interest rates, global manufacturing activity, and the pace of renewable energy expansion,\" Yoshida says. \"If inflation cools and rates stay hi"

Crude prices have carry-over support from last Friday's news from Baker Hughes that active US oil rigs fell to a 4.25-year low, although rigs this week rose by +3 rigs.\nDon\u2019t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart\u2019s best-in-class commodity analysis.The Venezuelan situation is supportive of crude prices. President Trump last week ordered a \"total and complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers\" going into and leaving Venezuela. The US Coast Guard last Saturday boarded the non-sanctioned Centuries tanker in the Caribbean. Also, US forces pursued tanker Bella 1, which is on its way to Venezuela.\nOil prices also have support after Ukraine last Friday hit a Russian shadow oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea with drones for the first time.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell -7% w/w to 107.15 million bbl in the week ended December 19.\nUkrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies. Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports.\nCrude also garnered support after OPEC+ on November 30 said it would stick to its plan to pause production increases in Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members would raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's November crude production fell by -10,000 bpd to 29.09 million bpd.\nLast month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus the previous month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit. Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of December 12 were -4.0% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.4% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.7% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending December 12 fell -0.1% w/w to 13.843 million bpd, just below the record high of 13.862 million bpd from the week of November 7.\nBaker Hughes reported Tuesday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ended December 26 rose by +3 rigs to 409 rigs, recovering slightly from the 4.25-year low of 406 rigs posted in the week ended December 19. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Crude oil inventories shrank by 9.3 million barrels in the week prior.\nCrude oil inventories in the United States are so far showing a net decrease of 6.7 million barrels for the year, according to Oilprice calculations of API data.\nEarlier this week, the Department of Energy (DoE) reported that crude oil inventories in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) have risen by 800,000 barrels to 413 million barrels in the week ending December 19 as the Trump Administration trudges ahead to replenish depleted stockpiles.\nUS production fell slightly during the week of December 12 to 13.843 million bpd, down from 13.853 million bpd in the week prior, according to the latest EIA data.

                "body": "EUR/USD Two Surprises from 2025\nMy top surprise from last year is actually two different items in the same market; and really, there\u2019s a surprising item behind the move(s), as well.\nPerhaps what was most surprising to me from 2025 was just how aggressively President Trump pushed into the rate cut conversation. Given his first term, I did expect some commentary on where he wanted rates to go, but in his second term this has seemed to take on an entirely new life where he was vociferously pushing for what could best be described as radical monetary policy. Towards the end of the year, Trump opined that he thought rates should go below 1%, which is far cry from the 3.5-3.75% range that we have into the end of 2025. At multiple points throughout the year, he threatened to fire Jerome Powell for not having cut rates more aggressively \u2013 and sooner.\nIn his first term, in which he originally nominated Powell for the position, some commentary or remarks around dissatisfaction from the Fed hiking rates were not abnormal. This would usually receive some condemnation from the media, usually around threats of Fed independence, but by and large those comments seemed somewhat distant and at least partially innocuous. It was out of the norm, however, by a traditional Presidential standard.\nIn his second term, however, he resorted to name calling and threats to fire Powell, even though it remains questionable as to whether a President can actually fire a Fed chair. And perhaps more interesting is the fact that Trump was soon going to get the chance to replace him anyways as Powell\u2019s term atop the bank is set to end next year.\nThis had a big impact in the US Dollar and in-turn, EUR/USD. As we came into 2025 it seemed almost a foregone conclusion that EUR/USD would revisit the parity handle. US Treasury rates were skyrocketing and the Euro had fallen by 1,000 pips from the Q3 2024 high down to the lows in early 2025 trade. But that\u2019s around the time a major Fibonacci level came into play to soften the bleeding. In February it was all about bears getting pushed back as an ascending triangle formed \u2013 and then in March, as threats of a recession in the U.S. took over and drove rate expectations lower, EUR/USD broke out in a very big way.\nThis is my first surprise on EUR/USD for 2025.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nMy second surprise on EUR/USD is what happened in the second half of the year, or perhaps more accurately \u2013 what did not happen. The pair found resistance at a familiar Fibonacci level in early Q3 trade and that resistance has largely remained in place ever since.\nThat rally in EUR/USD was largely relegated to the first half of the year. That\u2019s when the 76.4-78.6% retracements from the same Fibonacci setup came into play to mark the highs and for most of the second half of the year this remained a stumbling block for bulls.\nOn the fundamental side, it was as the Fed was opening the door for cuts that the backdrop for EUR/USD seemingly opened for bullish continuation. But after pushing up to a fresh three-year-high on the initial rate cut announcement, the pair stalled, and then actually started to sell-off, all the way until the 1.1500 level came into play and held the lows over two instances in November.\nOn the other side, the ECB opened the door to hikes in Q4, thereby increasing the potential for rate compression between the two economies but as of right now, the pair still has yet to take out that swing high from September 17th. At this point the trend on the daily chart remains bullish, even if the weekly chart shows digestion at a major level of longer-term resistance.\nBut a key fact to remember as we move into 2026 is that the pricing in of rate cuts can be very bearish, as we saw in the first half of 2025. But rate cuts themselves don\u2019t necessarily have to carry that same negative connotation for trend as perhaps the more important factor is \u2018what\u2019s next.\u2019 This is like what we s"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Annual Forecast: Growth to displace central banks from the limelight in 2026\n- The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are likely to lose relevance in 2026.\n- Trade tensions between China and the United States are unlikely to spread world chaos.\n- EUR/USD bulls retain control but remain unconvinced as focus shifts to growth imbalances.\nWhat a year! Donald Trump\u2019s return to the United States (US) Presidency was no doubt what led financial markets throughout 2025. His not-always-unexpected or surprising decisions shaped investors\u2019 sentiment, or better said, unprecedented uncertainty.\nTariffs then and now\nTariffs may sound like an old issue, but that was just a few months ago. After becoming the 46th President, Trump announced in April that he would equilibrate the US deficit by imposing massive tariffs on all trading counterparts. Such tariffs were meant to punish unfair trade practices and boost American manufacturing, according to Trump.\nOf course, China was Trump\u2019s biggest enemy in this so-called trade war, but neighbours Canada and Mexico were also at the top of the list.\nTrump imposed levies on a myriad of goods and services entering the US, initially announcing 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, but expanding it to over 400 other products in August.\nAdditionally, Trump used a federal law to declare a national emergency and increase tariffs on certain target countries. Through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the White House added levies on China, Canada, and Mexico in relation to fentanyl smuggling. He used the same tactic on India, as the country buys oil from Russia, and on Brazil, as a pressure tool on the current left-wing government.\nSource: atlanticcouncil.org (White House Executive Orders and fact sheets, GeoEconomics Center research)\nBy the end of the year, there\u2019s in place baseline 10% tariffs on all US trading partners, and roughly 60 other countries are subject to different levies.\nIn the case of China, average US tariffs on Chinese exports now stand at 47.5% and cover 100% of all goods. China's average tariffs on US exports are at 31.9% and cover 100% of all goods. US tariffs have risen by 26.8 % points since the second Trump administration began on January 20, 2025. Chinese tariffs have risen by 10.7% points over the same period, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nRegarding Canada and beyond the 35% fentanyl tariffs, the country is also facing 10% for energy, energy resources, and potash, and 35% for all other products. In the case of Mexico, levies stand at 10% for potash and 25% for all other products.\nAlso, US President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on multiple countries that are currently negotiating trade deals.\nTariffs took their toll on Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions\nThings around the Federal Reserve (Fed) have gone crazy throughout the year. The central bank anticipated, through the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released in December 2024, two interest rate cuts in 2025, finally delivering three, but not without pain.\nFed officials adopted a cautious stance in March, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rates steady at 4.5% for a second straight meeting, amid concerns that Trump\u2019s tariffs would revive inflationary pressures. Chair Jerome Powell expressed that tariffs could delay progress in lowering inflation.\nAs months went by, tariff-related inflation concerns eased, and the Fed reviewed its SEP. The central bank delivered a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in September, and anticipated two more in the docket. The central bank delivered in October, but shocked by hinting at no action in December. \u201cA further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" Powell said. \"There were strongly different views today. And the takeaway from that is that we haven't made a decision about December.\u201d\nThe Fed ended up cutting the federal funds ra"

                "body": "As of December 24, 2025, the British Pound has defied the skeptics of the post-Brexit era, firmly establishing a foothold above the $1.35 mark against the U.S. Dollar. This psychological and technical milestone, reached during a turbulent month for global markets, marks the currency\u2019s strongest performance in over three years. The surge is not merely a story of British resilience but a reflection of a profound shift in global capital flows, as investors rotate away from a cooling U.S. economy toward a UK market that has suddenly become a \"safe haven\" in a world of trade volatility.\nThe immediate implications are far-reaching. For the first time in recent memory, the FTSE 100 (INDEXFTSE:UKX) is on track to outperform the S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) for the calendar year, bolstered by a \"Santa rally\" that has seen the blue-chip index approach the historic 10,000 level. However, the strength of the Pound is a double-edged sword. While it provides a much-needed shield against imported inflation for UK consumers, it is simultaneously eroding the translated earnings of the UK's largest multi-national exporters, setting the stage for a complex corporate earnings season in early 2026.\nThe \"Hawkish Cut\" and the Fed\u2019s Internal Divide\nThe road to $1.35 was paved by a dramatic divergence in central bank policy during the final weeks of 2025. On December 18, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee delivered what analysts are calling a \"hawkish cut.\" In a narrow 5\u20134 vote, the BoE lowered the Bank Rate to 3.75%. Despite the reduction, the tone was one of extreme caution; four members voted to hold rates steady, citing \"sticky\" services inflation which remains stubbornly at 3.2%. This reluctance to ease further has provided a structural floor for the Pound, signaling to markets that the UK is not yet ready to follow the global race to the bottom in interest rates.\nIn stark contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve has found itself in a defensive posture. On December 10, 2025, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate to a range of 3.50%\u20133.75%, driven by a cooling labor market and the delayed impact of 2024\u2019s aggressive tightening. The decision was mired in political tension, as the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies\u2014most notably the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs enacted in April 2025\u2014began to weigh on domestic manufacturing. This policy divergence has triggered a \"Sell America\" sentiment, with capital fleeing the Greenback in favor of the Pound and the Euro.\nThe timeline leading to this moment began in the summer of 2025, when UK GDP growth began to stabilize at a modest but consistent 1.4%. While \"anaemic\" by historical standards, this stability contrasted sharply with the volatility in the U.S., where a surprise GDP acceleration to 4.3% in Q3 was overshadowed by fears of a \"tariff-induced\" recession in 2026. By the time the December meetings arrived, the Pound had already climbed from $1.28 in July to $1.34 in November, finally breaching the $1.35 resistance as the \"Santa rally\" took hold in London.\nWinners and Losers: The Corporate Divide\nThe sustained strength of the Pound has created a clear rift between winners and losers on both sides of the Atlantic. The primary beneficiaries are UK-based retailers and importers who settle their accounts in U.S. Dollars. Next PLC (LSE:NXT) and Associated British Foods (LSE:ABF), the parent company of Primark, have seen significant margin relief. For ABF, the $1.35 exchange rate has lowered the cost of apparel sourced from Asia, allowing Primark to absorb the UK's rising National Living Wage costs without passing price hikes to consumers. Marks & Spencer (LSE:MKS) has similarly leveraged the stronger currency to lower input costs for its premium food and clothing lines, outperforming its domestic rivals.\nConversely, the UK\u2019s heavyweights\u2014the global exporters\u2014are feeling the \"translation drag.\" AstraZeneca (LSE:AZN), which reports its earnings in USD, faces a significant headwind as its massive U.S. oncology s"

At the time of writing, GBP/USD trades around 1.3500, easing slightly after briefly touching an intraday high near 1.3534, its strongest level since September 19.\nMarkets showed a muted response to the latest weekly US labor market data, which offered mixed signals. Initial Jobless Claims fell to 214K from 224K in the previous week, undershooting the 223K market forecast. Meanwhile, Continuing Jobless Claims climbed to 1.923 million from 1.885 million, while the four-week average of Initial Claims edged down to 216.75K from 217.5K.\nDespite a short-term bounce, the US Dollar remains under sustained pressure as expectations for further monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed) into 2026 continue to weigh on the Greenback, keeping GBP/USD well supported. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, trades around 97.95, hovering just above its lowest level since October 3.\nMarkets broadly expect the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged at its January meeting, with the CME FedWatch Tool showing only a 13% probability of a rate cut. Speaking after the December policy decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \u201cwell positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves.\u201d Still, investors anticipate a return to easing later in the year, with markets currently pricing in two rate cuts in 2026.\nOn the UK side, the monetary policy outlook remains broadly supportive for Sterling. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to proceed cautiously in 2026 after signalling at its December meeting that, while interest rates could move lower over time, future policy decisions are becoming a \u201ccloser call,\u201d tempering expectations for an aggressive easing cycle.\nAccording to forecasts from UBS, the BoE is likely to deliver two additional 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2026, potentially in the first half of the year, which would take Bank Rate toward around 3.25%. UBS adds that lingering services inflation and still-elevated wage growth could slow the pace of easing.\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

The Aussie pair strengthens as the Australian Dollar (AUD) outperforms its peers amid expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could raise interest rates in 2026 to contain accelerating inflationary pressures.\nRBA hawkish expectations have been prompted after the release of the minutes of the monetary policy on Tuesday, which was announced on December 9, where they discussed raising interest rates next year. \u201cDiscussed whether a rate increase might be needed at some point in 2026, as recent data indicated risks to inflation have increased to the upside,\u201d RBA minutes showed.\nAccording to a report from Reuters, swaps now imply just a 27% probability of a rate hike from the RBA in February, but a move has been fully priced by June next year. There is a 56% probability of a follow-up move by the end of 2026.\nMeanwhile, a sharp decline in the US Dollar (USD) due to firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points (bps) in 2026 has also strengthened the Aussie pair. During the day, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, posts a fresh 11-week low at 97.75.\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nAUD/USD trades significantly higher above 0.6700 on Wednesday. The pair holds above the rising 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6561, keeping the short-term uptrend intact and favoring higher lows.\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 60.93 (above midline) confirms positive momentum. While price stays over the average, pullbacks would remain contained, and the bias would stay bullish.\nTrend conditions remain firm as the 20-week EMA continues to slope upward, with support aligned in an EMA band at 0.6561\u20130.6546. RSI is yet to reach overbought, leaving room for extension before 70.

It rose to a high of 0.6700, much higher than the November low of 0.6420.\nRBA Discussed Scenarios for Rate Hikes\nThe AUD/USD exchange rate held steady as the RBA minutes pointed to potential divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).\nMinutes released on Tuesday showed that Reserve Bank of Australia officials deliberated scenarios for interest rate hikes in the last monetary policy meeting of the year.\nTop Forex Brokers\nOdds that the RBA will hike interest rates rose sharply after the country published that recently inflation report, which showed that consumer prices jumped last month. Another report released this week showed that inflation expectations continued rising this month.\nAn RBA rate hike will happen as some Federal Reserve officials continue considering interest rate cuts even after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published strong macro numbers on Tuesday. Its report showed that the economy expanded at the fastest pace in years during the third quarter despite the ongoing tariff risks.\nThe American economy has been boosted by robust consumer spending, which is partly driven by the strong performance of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) companies.\nAdditionally, the ongoing AI spending has helped to boost the economy, with companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta Platforms spending billions of dollars in data centers.\nHowever, more data showed that the economy had some substantial risks, including the ongoing consumer confidence drop. Confidence has tumbled because of the rising unemployment rate and inflation fears in the country.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the AUD/USD exchange rate has held steady in the past few weeks, and on Tuesday, it moved to the highest level since October 2024. It moved above the important resistance level at 0.6685, its highest level in September and the previous YTD high.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have continued rising, a sign of growing momentum. Therefore, the pair will likely continue rising, with the next key target being the psychological level at 0.6800.

                "body": "Sydney \u2014 Australia\u2019s stock market is closed today, Thursday 25 December 2025, as the ASX cash market observes Christmas Day (and will also be closed on Boxing Day, Friday 26 December). The final session before the break ran on Wednesday 24 December with an early finish, setting up a four-day pause that leaves investors digesting global moves, record-setting commodities and shifting interest-rate expectations before trading resumes next week. [1]\nWith liquidity thinned across global markets on the holiday, the focus for Australian investors has moved from \u201cwhat happened today\u201d to what will matter most when the ASX reopens: bank-rate pricing, the Australian dollar\u2019s strength, and whether surging metals prices continue to support heavyweight miners into year-end. [2]\nIs the ASX open today? Holiday closure and the next trading session\nThe ASX trading calendar lists Thursday 25 December as closed (no trading day and no settlement), followed by another full-market closure on Friday 26 December. The exchange also notes that the last business day before Christmas Day (Wednesday 24 December) is an early close, and Wednesday 31 December is also scheduled to close early. [3]\nIn its Christmas Eve market coverage, ABC reported the ASX would be back next Monday, 29 December, after the holiday shutdown. [4]\nASX 200 last close: Banks eased, miners held up, week finished higher\nBecause the market is closed today, the most recent read on \u201cAustralia stock market today\u201d comes from the Christmas Eve session.\nABC\u2019s market wrap put the ASX 200 down 0.4% to 8,763 in the shortened Christmas Eve trade, while still finishing the week 1.6% higher overall. Sector performance was broadly weaker, with mining the notable exception as it stayed marginally positive amid strength in industrial metals. [5]\nThe same update highlighted the familiar pre-holiday dynamic: big banks weighed on the index, while miners benefited from commodity strength. ABC noted financials were lower on the day, with the major banks down between roughly 0.2% and 1%. [6]\nCompany-level moves also stood out in thin trading:\n- DroneShield gained after announcing a new contract.\n- Lendlease rose on a Sydney Metro development win.\n- Monash IVF fell after a consortium withdrew its bid. [7]\nAustralian dollar strengthens: Rate expectations and commodity support in focus\nOne of the biggest cross-asset signals heading into the break was the Australian dollar pushing to about 67 US cents, which ABC described as its highest level since October 2024. [8]\nThe currency strength matters for Australian equities in two ways:\n- It can pressure exporters\u2019 translated earnings, particularly for companies with significant offshore revenue bases.\n- It can coincide with \u201crisk-on\u201d commodity momentum\u2014supportive for materials\u2014while also reflecting changing views on domestic rates.\nOn the rates side, Reuters\u2019 account of the RBA\u2019s December meeting minutes said policymakers discussed conditions under which a rate rise might need to be considered in 2026, as inflation risk tilted higher after stronger readings. Reuters reported the cash rate was held at 3.60%, with markets seeing the probability of a February hike at around the mid\u201120% range. [9]\nABC also pointed to the next major domestic catalyst: December-quarter inflation data due in late January, ahead of the RBA\u2019s early-February meeting. [10]\nSeparately, Commonwealth Bank\u2019s economics team said it expects the RBA to raise rates by 0.25% in February, and outlined a scenario where the cash rate could reach 3.85% by end\u20112026 if inflation remains sticky. [11]\nCommodities drive the narrative: Record gold and copper, iron ore steady\nFor the ASX\u2014where materials and energy carry outsized weight\u2014commodity pricing has been the most important holiday-week input.\nABC\u2019s Christmas Eve snapshot showed:\n- Spot gold near record territory (around US$4,495/oz at the time of its update),\n- Iron ore around US$104/tonne, and\n- Oil broadly steady.

Japanese Yen was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nThe pair has given up its entire gains made following the monetary policy announcement by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) on Thursday, in which it raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 0.75%. The Japanese Yen (JPY) fell sharply as the BoJ didn\u2019t provide guidance on the scope and timeframe for further interest rate hikes.\nMeanwhile, the Yen has been gaining higher this week due to threats of intervention by Japan\u2019s Finance Minister (FM) Satsuki Katayama against excessive one-sided moves.\nGoing forward, the Japanese Yen will be influenced by the Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December, which will be released on Friday. Tokyo CPI ex. Fresh Food is expected to have grown at an annualized pace of 2.5%, slower than 2.8% in November.\nIn addition to Yen\u2019s recovery, persistent weakness in the US Dollar (USD) due to firm Federal Reserve (Fed) dovish expectations for 2026 has also strengthened the pair. The CME FedWatch tool shows the odds of the Fed reducing interest rates at least 50 bps in 2026 are 70.6%.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during"

                "body": "The US Dollar\u2019s Global Role\nThe US Dollar has weakened amidst expectations of the Fed\u2019s dovish stance in 2026. The CME FedWatch tool indicates a 70.6% probability of a 50 bps rate cut by the Fed. The US Dollar is the most traded currency internationally, with over $6.6 trillion in daily transactions. It became the global reserve currency post-World War II, surpassing the British Pound, and remains unbacked by gold since 1971.\nFederal Reserve decisions significantly influence the USD through monetary policy. This includes interest rate adjustments to maintain price stability and employment. Quantitative easing and tightening are non-standard monetary policies that impact the US Dollar\u2019s strength.\nMarket Forces Affecting USD/JPY\nWith USD/JPY pulling back to 155.80, we see the pair giving up all its recent gains from the Bank of Japan\u2019s rate hike. This move is driven by two key forces pressing on the market as we head into the new year of 2026. The outlook for further BoJ tightening is firming up while expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts are solidifying.\nThe weakness in the US Dollar is a significant factor, with the latest November 2025 US CPI data showing inflation cooling to 2.9%, reinforcing the case for Fed easing. We are seeing a strong consensus, with Fed funds futures pricing in over a 70% chance of at least two rate cuts in 2026. This environment makes buying USD/JPY call options, which bet on a rising price, seem particularly risky right now.\nOn the other side, the Japanese Yen is gaining strength from official warnings against excessive currency moves. We remember the direct market interventions back in late 2022, when the Ministry of Finance spent over \u00a59 trillion to support the yen, which shows these threats have teeth and can cause sharp reversals. This history suggests that traders should consider hedging against a rapid appreciation of the yen in the coming weeks.\nThe upcoming Tokyo CPI data this Friday is a major event that could inject volatility into the market. A higher-than-expected inflation figure would likely accelerate bets on another BoJ rate hike, pushing USD/JPY lower. Derivative traders should note that implied volatility on JPY options will likely rise ahead of this release, making strategies like long straddles potentially attractive for playing a big price swing.\nGiven the downward pressure from both currencies, strategies that benefit from a falling or range-bound USD/JPY appear more favorable. Buying put options offers a direct way to bet on further declines toward the 155.00 level. For a more conservative approach, we could look at implementing bear put spreads to limit costs while still capturing potential downside."

                "body": "During the Asian trading session on Wednesday, the Japanese yen (JPY) edged higher, with the US dollar/yen (USD/JPY) maintaining a weaker trend. The market's reassessment of the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy stance has been an important factor driving the recent strengthening of the yen.\nThe minutes from the Bank of Japan\u2019s October meeting revealed that policy board members engaged in substantive discussions about whether further interest rate hikes are necessary. They noted that if inflation and economic forecasts materialize as expected, there remains room for further monetary tightening.\nAt the subsequent December meeting, the Bank of Japan raised its policy interest rate to 0.75%, reaching its highest level in approximately 30 years, while leaving open the possibility of future adjustments.\nThis hawkish signal has made the yen stand out among major currencies. In contrast, expectations for US monetary policy have leaned significantly towards easing. Markets widely anticipate that the Federal Reserve still has room for further rate cuts, keeping the US dollar index near its lowest levels in recent months.\nThe divergence in monetary policies has weakened the relative yield advantage of the US dollar, providing conditions for a rebound in the low-yield yen. According to market surveys, statements from US officials suggesting 'lowering rates even amid good economic performance' have intensified discussions about the independence of the Fed\u2019s policy and the future trajectory of easing.\nMoreover, safe-haven demand has also been a key driver behind the yen\u2019s strength. Concerns over risks such as Venezuela\u2019s energy shipments, escalating conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and potential instability in the Middle East have prompted periodic capital inflows into safe-haven assets.\nAmid downward pressure on the US dollar, the yen\u2019s safe-haven characteristics have been further amplified. Despite the US third-quarter GDP annualized growth rate reaching 4.3%, significantly above market expectations, the strong headline data failed to provide meaningful support to the greenback.\nIndicators such as the decline in durable goods orders and weakening consumer confidence have led markets to focus more on the sustainability of underlying economic momentum. In the short term, investors will closely monitor US initial jobless claims, while Tokyo inflation data is seen as a key variable influencing yen demand.\nFrom a daily chart perspective, after retreating from around 158, USD/JPY has gradually formed a medium-term bearish pattern. Prices, after facing resistance during a rebound, have retreated back to the lower boundary of the previous consolidation range, indicating persistent selling pressure at higher levels. Technically, a double-top structure around the 158 area is becoming increasingly evident, reinforcing expectations of a technical correction.\nIn terms of momentum indicators, the MACD is trading below the zero line, with green bars expanding moderately, suggesting that bearish forces are accumulating. The RSI has dropped to around 50, signaling a shift from bullish bias to neutral-to-weak sentiment. If the exchange rate effectively breaks below the psychological level of 155.00, the 154.5 level will become a key support zone; a breach could lead to further downside risks.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nOverall, the decline in USD/JPY is not driven by a single factor but is the result of diverging policy expectations compounded by risk-off sentiment. The Bank of Japan's relatively hawkish stance provides medium-term support for the yen, while the US dollar struggles to regain strength amid expectations of rate cuts.\nIn the short term, if risk events continue to unfold, USD/JPY may still face downward pressure. However, with lower liquidity at year-end, the trend could exhibit volatile downward movements, necessitating attention to potential breakouts at key technical levels."

The BoC kept its policy rate unchanged at 2.25% at its December meeting and signalled comfort with its current policy stance, saying current settings are appropriate to support the economy while keeping inflation close to the 2% target.\nMarkets have largely interpreted the decision as marking the end of the BoC\u2019s easing cycle, following a cumulative 100 basis points (bps) of rate cuts since the beginning of the year. In its latest meeting minutes, Governing Council members acknowledged that uncertainty remains elevated and discussed whether the next policy move would be a hike or a cut. While officials agreed that the current policy rate is \u201cabout right\u201d for now, they stressed that the timing and direction of the next adjustment remain difficult to predict.\nThat said, the base-case view is for the BoC to keep the policy rate around 2.25% through most of next year, with some upside risk that the next move could be a hike in the second half of 2026.\nIn contrast, the Fed is seen moving along a more gradual easing path. Markets expect further monetary policy easing next year after the Fed delivered a total of 75 bps of rate cuts this year. However, policymakers remain divided on the need for additional cuts, citing differing views on inflation and labour market conditions.\nHowever, markets widely expect the Fed to hold rates steady in January, with CME FedWatch pricing just a 13% chance of a cut, while still anticipating two rate cuts later in the year.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price r"

                "body": "The USD/CAD is trading near five-month lows as holiday-thinned markets limit volatility. The Canadian Dollar gains support from a policy divergence between the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), with the BoC expected to hold rates through 2026.\nDespite the US Dollar (USD) trading strongly, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) holds modest gains. Currently, USD/CAD is around 1.3675, its lowest since July.\nCanadian and US Economies\nOn Tuesday, Canada\u2019s GDP data revealed a 0.3% monthly contraction in October, aligning with expectations. The US economy\u2019s preliminary third-quarter GDP outperformed predictions, showing a 4.3% annualised growth.\nThe BoC\u2019s decision to maintain a 2.25% policy rate, with an end to its easing cycle, contrasts with the Fed\u2019s anticipated gradual easing. Markets expect the BoC to hold rates steady until 2026, while the Fed\u2019s future rate cuts are uncertain.\nKey factors influencing the CAD include the BoC\u2019s interest rates, oil prices, economic health, inflation, and trade balance. High oil prices and positive economic indicators generally support the CAD, attracting foreign investment.\nHigher inflation may lead to raised interest rates, benefiting the CAD. Economic strength can attract foreign investors and lead to a stronger Canadian Dollar.\nWith USD/CAD testing five-month lows near 1.3675, the main driver remains the widening policy gap between the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. Holiday-thinned markets are keeping volatility low for now, but we see this as an opportunity to position for early 2026. The core view is that the BoC will hold rates firm while the Fed prepares to cut.\nCanadian Dollar and Energy Markets\nThis divergence is backed by recent data that we are watching closely. November\u2019s Canadian inflation report, for instance, came in at a stubborn 2.9% year-over-year, giving the BoC every reason to maintain its 2.25% policy rate. In contrast, markets are pricing in a greater than 65% chance of a Fed rate cut by their March 2026 meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThe strength in the Canadian dollar is also getting a significant boost from energy markets. WTI crude oil prices have climbed back above $82 per barrel, supported by stronger winter demand forecasts and continued OPEC+ supply discipline. As oil is Canada\u2019s largest export, this price strength provides a fundamental tailwind for the loonie.\nFor derivative traders, the current low implied volatility in the quiet holiday period presents a chance to buy options relatively cheaply. We believe purchasing Canadian dollar call options or US dollar put options with expirations in late Q1 2026 could be an effective way to play this trend. These positions would benefit if the pair continues its downward move as trading volumes return in January.\nHowever, we must remain aware of the risks to this view. Recent data showed the Canadian economy contracted in October 2025, while US Q3 GDP was a robust 4.3%, suggesting the US economy is on much stronger footing. Furthermore, speculative positioning data shows that long Canadian dollar trades are becoming crowded, which could lead to a sharp reversal if market sentiment shifts."

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY trades around 210.60, holding firm near year-to-date highs and its highest level since August 2008.\nThe Japanese Yen has remained broadly weak this year, as fiscal concerns under the new leadership of Sanae Takaichi and a gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation continued to weigh on the currency. Against this backdrop, GBP/JPY is up around 6.9% year to date, reflecting persistent policy divergence between the UK and Japan.\nFrom a technical perspective, the daily chart continues to reflect a strong uptrend, marked by a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows, with prices holding comfortably above key moving averages.\nThat said, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is easing from overbought territory and hovers around 68, signalling a risk of a mild pullback or consolidation before the next leg higher. A sustained recovery could see the pair push beyond the 212.00 handle, extending the broader bullish trend.\nOn the downside, initial support is seen in the 208.50-208.00 zone, where the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) sits near 208.13. A decisive break below this short-term average would weaken the bullish structure and open the door for a deeper pullback toward the 50-day SMA around 205.22, followed by the 100-day SMA near 202.57.\nMeanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is holding near 27, signalling that the trend remains strong, even as momentum cools in the near term.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a c"

That means investors need to dig into the details to determine which is better.\nFor the most part, choosing between spot Bitcoin ETFs comes down to expense ratios and trading spreads.\nThe iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is the largest of the bunch, but it's not the one I'd choose first.\n10 stocks we like better than Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust \u203a\nIt's been nearly two years since the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched. In all, 11 new ETFs were approved by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), including ones from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and Bitwise.\nTo say they've been successful would be a massive understatement. Collectively, they account for over $110 billion in assets under management, more than half of which comes from the iShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT).\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nBitcoin ETFs are an unusual case because there is structurally no difference between them. They all invest in spot Bitcoin. There's no selection methodology. There's no weighting strategy. They're functionally all the same.\nTo distinguish which Bitcoin ETF is better than another, you need to look at the details. For the most part, it comes down to cost -- which has the lower expense ratio and which has lower trading costs. Keeping the total cost of ownership as low as possible helps keep more returns in an investor's pockets.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nGiven those guidelines, here are the three spot bitcoin ETFs that I like for 2026.\nGrayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (NYSEMKT: BTC) has the best combination of low fees, tight spreads, and high liquidity.\nIt was designed to be the cheaper version of the much larger Grayscale Bitcoin ETF. That ETF maintained its 1.5% expense ratio when it was converted from a trust, making it easily the worst spot Bitcoin ETF of the group. Grayscale launched the Mini Trust ETF at just a tenth of the cost of its flagship ETF as a way to entice new retail buyers to its products without giving up the hefty revenue that GBTC has been bringing in.\nIts expense ratio of 0.15%, or $15 annually per $10,000 invested, is the cheapest within the spot Bitcoin ETF group. With about $3.6 billion in assets under management, this ETF is more than large enough to be highly liquid and tradeable throughout the day. Its minimal trading spread makes the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF the cheapest spot Bitcoin ETF in terms of total cost of ownership and the best option for retail traders to own.\niShares Bitcoin ETF\nThe iShares Bitcoin ETF is the poster child for the spot bitcoin ETF category. It has more than $70 billion in assets and nearly crossed the $100 billion mark earlier this year during the big Bitcoin rally.\nAdvertisement\nThe ETF's 0.25% expense ratio is about average within this space and matches the fee charged by several other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Where it has its advantage is with liquidity and trading.\nIn terms of dollar volume, it trades nearly three times as much as all of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs combined. That makes spreads incredibly tight, creating a direct cost advantage with every trade. If you're a one-time buy-and-hold investor in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you may be better off with one of the funds carrying a lower expense ratio. If you're a more frequent trader, this ETF could be the better choice because the savings you'll see on trading spreads will likely outweigh the expense ratio deficit in just a few trades.\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF\nI wrestled between the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: FBTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF for the third spot on this list. The Bitwise ETF has the advantage on expense ratio (0.2% vs. 0.25%) and the trading spreads on both are pretty tight.\nUltimately, "

                "body": "TLDR\n- Arthur Hayes sold millions in ETH as market sentiment weakened further\n- He accumulated ENA aggressively despite the token trading far below its peak\n- Pendle was added as Hayes targeted yield-focused DeFi opportunities\n- ETHFI became the latest DeFi addition following continued ETH sales\n- The moves signal a broader pivot toward liquidity-sensitive altcoins\nArthur Hayes intensified his portfolio shift this week as he executed a series of Ethereum sales and redirected the capital into select DeFi tokens. The activity continued a trend that began earlier in December\nand strengthened as market sentiment weakened. This move reinforced Arthur Hayes\u2019 changing strategy as he positioned his holdings toward assets he considered more responsive to liquidity conditions.\nENA Accumulation Marks a Major Shift\nArthur Hayes expanded his rotation by adding more ENA after reducing his ETH exposure throughout the month. He sold additional ETH valued at roughly $2 million and used part of the proceeds to acquire fresh ENA at lower prices. Moreover, this step highlighted Arthur Hayes\u2019 preference for tokens that experienced heavy declines during the year.\nHe purchased about 1.22 million ENA during the recent buying cycle and increased his exposure despite market weakness. The token traded almost 80% below its yearly peak, yet Arthur Hayes maintained interest as he reshaped his portfolio. The ENA position signaled an effort to capture potential upside as broader liquidity improved.\nThe shift also aligned with earlier activity when he exchanged ETH for ENA during weekend trading sessions. Data showed that ENA represented a recurring target for accumulation as his ETH holdings continued to shrink. Arthur Hayes reinforced his position by repeatedly entering the market during discounted conditions.\nPendle Gains Attention in the Rotation\nArthur Hayes further advanced his strategy by adding Pendle to his updated asset mix. He acquired more than 137,000 tokens during the latest round of purchases, and he redirected part of his ETH proceeds into this position. This decision followed several transfers that moved ETH from his wallet to major exchanges.\nPendle traded significantly lower this year, yet Arthur Hayes treated the decline as an opportunity to diversify. The token\u2019s performance remained weak, but the rotation demonstrated his preference for assets tied to yield-oriented activity. The move indicated a steady exit from large ETH exposure.\nArkham data showed a considerable reduction in his Ethereum holdings as stablecoins became a larger portion of his wallet. This pattern surfaced throughout December and accelerated during the past week., Arthur Hayes displayed a clear restructure of his on-chain profile.\nETHFI Becomes the Latest Addition\nArthur Hayes also added ETHFI as part of his expanding DeFi basket. He purchased more than 132,000 tokens using funds sourced from ongoing ETH sales.This action followed consecutive transfers to Binance and other platforms.\nETHFI remained down sharply this year, yet the purchase indicated continued confidence in alternative token opportunities. The decision kept his rotation consistent as he reduced ETH and increased exposure to assets he believed could respond to improving liquidity. This marked another reinforcement of his broader allocation plan.\nHe moved more than 1,800 ETH during the past week, which totaled approximately $5.5 million. These transactions demonstrated a clear and deliberate adjustment of his holdings. Through these coordinated steps, Arthur Hayes executed one of his most notable transitions of the year."

                "body": "Key Takeaways:\n- Sandwich attacks drained up to $500 million from Solana users in 16 months, but coordinated action cut profitability by 60\u201370% in 2025.\n- 415 million SOL is now staked, representing 75% of circulating supply, driven by a sharp rise in native staking and institutional inflows.\n- Marinade Finance, Jito, and the Solana Foundation blacklisted 50+ malicious validators, protecting over $2 billion in delegated stake.\nSolana\u2019s 2025 staking boom did not come without pain. As participation surged, so did MEV-driven exploitation. What followed was one of the most aggressive, coordinated crackdowns on validator-level abuse the ecosystem has seen.\nTable of Contents\nSandwich Attacks: A $500 Million Problem Finally Confronted\nFor over a year, sandwich attacks quietly siphoned value from everyday Solana users. Research estimates show that between $370 million and $500 million was extracted over a 16-month period, with roughly 0.72% of all blocks containing some form of sandwich activity.\nThe mechanics were simple but brutal. Malicious validators or bots detected pending trades, inserted their own transactions before and after the victim\u2019s order, and pocketed the price difference. On Solana\u2019s ultra-fast network, low fees and high throughput made these attacks cheap to execute and hard to avoid.\nSome validators abused their position heavily. Data shows certain operators included sandwich attacks in up to 27% of the blocks they produced, turning block production into a private profit engine at users\u2019 expense. At the beginning of 2025, grievances regarding slippage and front-running were no longer to be disregarded.\nA Coordinated Ecosystem Response in 2025\nHow Solana Reduced MEV Abuse by Up to 70%\nThis was the turning point which was delivered by several stakeholders simultaneously. Marinade Finance was among the most forceful, blacklisting over 50 of its Stake Auction Marketplace validators who were caught attacking sandwiches. This is the only measure that has protected more than $2 billion in delegated SOL by stopping bad actors instead of using soft deterrents.\nOn the infrastructure level, in March 2025 Jito Foundation closed its public mempool, eliminating the most easily available source of transaction sniffing and front-running. This removed the least friction attack point at night.\nMeanwhile, the Solana Foundation removed malicious validators from its delegation programs, signaling that MEV abuse would no longer be tolerated as a \u201cgrey area\u201d behavior.\nThe result was measurable. Profitability from sandwich attacks dropped an estimated 60\u201370%, and user complaints tied to front-running and excessive slippage fell by roughly 60% across major Solana DEXs. The attacks did not disappear, but they became harder, riskier, and less lucrative.\nSolana Staking Hits a Structural Inflection Point\nSecurity improvements landed at the same time Solana staking reached new highsBy the end of 2025, approximately 415 million SOL was staked, and it had reached 75% of total participation in the network. Transactions were also at their highest point of about 600 million on a weekly basis and institutional inflows in the third quarter was estimated to be $530 million. It was more than a change of scale, but composition.\nRead More: Solana Price Prediction 2025\u20132050: 500% Gains by 2050 \u2013 Is It Worth Investing?\nNative Staking Closes the Gap with Liquid Staking\nLiquid staking tokens (LSTs) ruled the years as they were flexible and able to be used in DeFi. In 2025, that balance shifted. Native staking took off as protocols sealed out old usability holes. The native staking TVL of Marinade increased 21% quarter-to-quarter to 5.3 million SOL and surpassed its liquid staking token mSOL.\nCleaner UX and instant exit tools directly delegating out of self-custody wallets did not feel restrictive anymore.

                "body": "SOLUSD Today: Coinbase Opens SOL-to-Base Bridge, December 24 Update\nCoinbase Solana Base bridge is live today, allowing native SOL transfers between Solana and Coinbase\u2019s Base network without third\u2011party bridges. For Australians, this could streamline access to DeFi on Base and improve cross\u2011chain liquidity for SOLUSD. SOL now has an ERC\u201120 representation on Base, so it can interact with EVM apps while deposits and withdrawals remain native. SOL trades near $122.43 today, with momentum still soft. We explain how it works, what it costs, and the practical trade setup for local investors.\nWhat changed with Coinbase\u2019s upgrade\nCoinbase now supports direct SOL deposits to Base and withdrawals back to Solana. Users avoid third\u2011party bridges and move assets inside the Coinbase stack, reducing extra steps and possible failure points. According to early coverage, the rollout focuses on making SOL portable across chains while keeping custody simple for retail users. See details in Coinpaper.\nOn Base, users receive a Solana ERC-20 representation that works across EVM DeFi. You can trade, provide liquidity, and interact with smart contracts using SOL on Base, while paying network gas in ETH. Coinbase notes some regional access limits; Australian users should pass standard KYC and review in\u2011app availability. A second recap is on Bitcoinsensus.\nLiquidity and price implications for SOL\nThe Coinbase Solana Base bridge may lift cross\u2011chain liquidity by routing more flows through a single venue. Tighter spreads can follow if more order flow aggregates around Base-linked venues. Centralized settlement plus on\u2011chain execution could help reduce slippage during busy periods. Still, liquidity gains depend on user adoption, app support for SOL on Base, and gas costs on Ethereum L2s.\nSOL trades near $122.43, down about 1.2% on the day. RSI sits at 37.8, close to oversold. Price is below the 50\u2011day ($138.03) and 200\u2011day ($174.48) averages, signaling a weak trend. Bollinger mid is $131.76 with lower band near $117.95. ATR is 9.57, implying wider daily swings. MACD histogram turned slightly positive, hinting at fading downside momentum.\nWhat this means for Australian investors\nAussies typically fund in AUD, but Coinbase prices SOL and fees in USD terms. Expect FX spread plus network gas on Base paid in ETH. Compare spreads between spot SOL on Solana and SOL on Base before moving size. Start with a small test transfer, confirm arrival, then scale. Track gas at quiet times for lower costs.\nWith SOL on Base, users can access EVM\u2011friendly apps, liquidity pools, and routing that were not available on Solana alone. This can expand yield and trading options without juggling external bridges. Always review contract audits, pool depth, and slippage. The big win is convenience, but smart\u2011contract risk and market volatility still apply.\nActionable trade setup and key levels\nFor near term, support sits around the Bollinger lower band at $117.95. A reclaim of $131.76 would improve tone, with $138.03 (50\u2011day) as the next hurdle. Above that, $145.58 (upper band) is a stretch target. ATR at 9.57 suggests planning position sizes for 8\u201110 dollar daily ranges.\nIf the Coinbase Solana Base bridge boosts activity, SOL could benefit from stronger flows into SOL on Base. Model projections in our data show a 1\u2011month baseline near $120.54, quarterly $187.23, and yearly $181.10. These are not guarantees. Set alerts, add gradually on strength, and review adoption metrics weekly.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Coinbase Solana Base bridge removes a major pain point for moving SOL between Solana and Base, while introducing a clean Solana ERC-20 representation for EVM apps. For Australians, this can cut steps, reduce operational risk, and widen DeFi access. Near term, watch how much liquidity shifts into SOL on Base, fee conditions on Base, and whether spreads tighten. For trading, respect the current downtrend but prepare for a rebound if price reclaims $131.76 and the 50\u2011day near $138. Plan entr"

                "body": "Solana resumes its descent as price pressure persists despite institutional interest\nSolana has slipped back towards $123 as bearish momentum persists, even as ETF inflows and whale accumulation suggest deeper demand remains intact.\nSolana resumes its descent\nOver the past month, Solana's (SOL) has continued to navigate a complex market environment as price action, institutional flows and network dynamics unfold against a backdrop of broader crypto volatility.\nIn recent sessions, SOL\u2019s price has been relatively subdued, trading near support levels around $123.00 after earlier declines that pushed the token down from higher ranges.\nAnalysts note that the market\u2019s sideways behaviour reflects cautious sentiment, with buyers and sellers balancing near key technical thresholds amid thin year-end liquidity conditions.\nDespite this price pressure, institutional demand for Solana has remained a notable driver of interest. Solana has seen steady inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking multiple weeks of positive institutional flows, while large holders - commonly referred to as whales - have been building positions in the spot market. This combination of steady institutional support and reduced leverage in derivatives markets suggests that deeper demand continues to underpin SOL, even as short-term volatility persists.\nOn-chain activity and broader adoption metrics present a mixed picture. Some reports indicate that on-chain activity, including decentralised exchange volumes, has declined significantly from earlier peaks, highlighting a divergence between Solana\u2019s underlying blockchain usage and speculative price momentum. Nonetheless, the ecosystem continues to draw investment in certain segments, even as market participants await clearer directional moves.\nAdding to the narrative of cautious accumulation, recent data also show that whale investors have been buying the dip at multi-month lows, with large orders being executed through major exchanges. This behaviour indicates that while retail sentiment appears tepid, deep-pocketed players may be positioning for a potential recovery or significant event catalyst rather than exiting the ecosystem entirely.\nBeyond price and flows, ecosystem developments continue to shape Solana\u2019s longer-term narrative. Although not every update has immediate price impact, innovations within the Solana ecosystem - such as new institutional products, developer tools and expansions in decentralised finance infrastructure - reinforce the perception that Solana\u2019s network layer remains active and evolving.\nBroader headlines around crypto adoption and infrastructure - including major financial institutions exploring crypto trading services that could eventually include tokens like SOL - hint at an expanding role for Solana in institutional portfolios, even if such developments are still in early stages.\nAltogether, the last couple of weeks illustrate Solana\u2019s position as a market balancing consolidation and ongoing interest. Price action remains under pressure amid a cautious macro backdrop and reduced liquidity, but steady institutional flows, whale accumulation and broader ecosystem relevance suggest that deeper conviction has not faded entirely.\nWhether Solana breaks out of its recent range to the upside - or drifts lower if support weakens - will likely depend on macro sentiment, liquidity dynamics and continued engagement from larger market participants.\nSolana bearish scenario:\nSOL remains in a clearly defined downtrend while trading below its downtrend line and Monday's $128.70 high.\nA fall through the current December low at $116.94 would probably push the psychological $100.00 mark to the fore.\nSolana bullish scenario:\nAt the very least the October-to-December downtrend line at $125.59 and, more importantly, Monday's $128.70 high will need to be overcome for a recovery to gain traction.\nEven if a short-term bullish reversal were to unfold, the next higher 20 November to 4 December highs "

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.2%. Markets closed early for Christmas Eve and will remain closed for Christmas Thursday. The S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year, driven by optimism about artificial intelligence and deregulatory policies.

                "body": "Updated: 5:01 p.m. ET, Wednesday, December 24, 2025\nWall Street wrapped up a holiday-shortened Christmas Eve session with fresh records, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 finished at all-time closing highs and the Nasdaq added to its year-end advance. Thin trading volume and an early close shaped the day\u2019s tone, but investors still found reasons to buy\u2014helped by upbeat labor-market data, a rebound in AI-linked shares, and renewed debate over how far the Federal Reserve will cut rates in 2026. [1]\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq close higher on Dec. 24\nIn Wednesday\u2019s shortened trading session:\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 288.75 points (+0.6%) to 48,731.16\n- S&P 500 gained 22.26 points (+0.32%) to 6,932.05\n- Nasdaq Composite added 51.46 points (+0.22%) to 23,613.31 [2]\nThe gains capped a fifth straight session of advances for the major indexes, reinforcing the late-December \u201crisk-on\u201d mood that often appears as the year winds down\u2014especially when investors feel the Fed is closer to easing than tightening. [3]\nWhy stocks rose: AI rebound, resilient jobs data, and rate-cut expectations\n1) AI-linked stocks found their footing again\nAfter last week\u2019s pullback\u2014driven by renewed worries about stretched valuations and whether heavy AI spending will ultimately translate into profits\u2014AI-related names bounced, helping lift broader sentiment. [4]\nThat AI \u201cre-rating\u201d debate is becoming one of the market\u2019s defining themes heading into 2026: bulls see multi-year earnings upside, while skeptics worry capital expenditures are rising faster than proven returns. [5]\n2) Jobless claims surprised to the downside\nNew filings for U.S. unemployment benefits fell to 214,000 (week ended Dec. 20), down 10,000 from the prior week. The Labor Department\u2019s release also showed insured unemployment at 1.923 million and an insured unemployment rate of 1.3% (week ended Dec. 13). [6]\nFor markets, the takeaway was familiar: the labor market still looks slower than earlier in the cycle, but not broken\u2014supporting the \u201csoft landing\u201d narrative that has helped keep equities bid up even after multiple years of strong gains. [7]\n3) Traders still see Fed cuts in 2026\u2014even if January looks unlikely\nInvestors continued to price in roughly 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2026, even as expectations for a January move remained low, according to commentary tied to Fed-funds futures and the CME FedWatch framework referenced in market coverage. [8]\nThat rate path matters because 2025\u2019s rally\u2014now a third straight year of double-digit gains for the S&P 500\u2014has been tightly linked to a combination of AI optimism, easing financial conditions, and an economy that kept growing. [9]\nHoliday trading conditions: early close, light volume, and what that signals\nWednesday\u2019s session was notable not just for record closes, but for how quiet it was.\n- U.S. stock markets closed early at 1:00 p.m. ET for Christmas Eve, with certain late sessions closing later in the afternoon. [10]\n- Bond markets observed an early close recommendation (2:00 p.m. ET) per SIFMA\u2019s holiday guidance. [11]\n- Trading was extremely light: Reuters reported 7.61 billion shares traded across U.S. exchanges versus a 16.21 billion 20-day average, while AP reported roughly 1.8 billion shares on the NYSE\u2014about a third of an average day. [12]\nWhy it matters: thin liquidity can amplify moves\u2014up or down. Big institutional players are often underweight activity during holiday weeks, so price action can reflect positioning and headlines more than deep conviction. [13]\nBiggest movers and headlines: Micron, Nike, Dynavax, Intel\u2014and an Nvidia deal report\nEven in a shortened session, single-stock news drove outsized moves:\nMicron hits a closing record\nMicron Technology shares rose 3.8% to a closing record of $286.68, extending a rally after the company issued a strong forecast last week. [14]\nNike jumps after a high-profile insider buy\nNike jumped 4.6% after Apple CEO Tim Cook, a Nike board member, boug"

                "body": "London\u2019s stock market wrapped up Christmas Eve trading with a familiar holiday feel: thin volumes, narrow moves, and a heavy focus on a handful of big headlines. The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged in the shortened session, while investors digested a blockbuster BP asset sale, a firmer pound, and another surge in precious metals that has become one of 2025\u2019s defining cross\u2011asset trends. [1]\nThe London Stock Exchange runs a half\u2011day on Christmas Eve, with the market\u2019s closing process commencing from 12:30pm London time, before the holiday shutdown. [2]\nUK Market Close: FTSE 100 Barely Moves in Holiday\u2011Thinned Trade\nIn the end, UK equities did exactly what many traders expected on a holiday half\u2011day: not very much.\nAccording to published historical pricing for the session, the FTSE 100 closed at 9,890.40, up 0.01%, after trading in an exceptionally tight range between 9,886.20 and 9,890.50. [3]\nThat near\u2011flat finish neatly matched the pre\u2011open tone, when futures were pointing to only a small dip at the open and strategists warned that liquidity would be thin heading into the Christmas break. [4]\nThe Big UK Stock Market Story Today: BP Sells Majority Stake in Castrol\nThe standout corporate development dominating UK market coverage on 24 December was BP\u2019s deal to sell a 65% stake in Castrol to infrastructure investor Stonepeak.\nReuters reported BP will receive about $6 billion for the 65% stake, with Castrol valued at $10.1 billion. BP will keep a 35% interest and\u2014critically for investors watching capital discipline\u2014Reuters also noted the proceeds are intended to help reduce BP\u2019s debt, and that the structure includes a two\u2011year lock\u2011in before BP could divest its remaining stake. [5]\nThe Financial Times framed the transaction as a central plank of BP\u2019s \u201creset\u201d effort, tying it to a broader plan to divest $20 billion of assets by 2027 amid pressure to simplify and improve returns. [6]\nWhy the Castrol deal matters for UK equities beyond BP\nEven on a quiet trading day, the BP\u2011Castrol headline carried wider market relevance:\n- Energy-sector positioning: BP is one of the FTSE\u2019s heavyweight constituents, so major portfolio decisions can influence sentiment well beyond the stock itself. [7]\n- Capital allocation signals: The market remains highly sensitive to how large UK companies balance debt reduction, dividends, and reinvestment\u2014especially after several years where UK equities have been pitched globally as a \u201ccash return\u201d market. [8]\n- Boardroom pressure and leadership shifts: BP\u2019s strategic pivot is unfolding alongside senior leadership change, adding to a broader FTSE theme this year: unusually high CEO turnover. [9]\nSterling Climbs Above $1.35: Supportive for UK Confidence, a Headwind for Some FTSE Earners\nCurrency moves were also a major part of the day\u2019s UK market narrative.\nThe pound climbed to a three\u2011month high near $1.3534, helped by US dollar softness even as markets assessed stronger US growth data. [10]\nFor the UK stock market, that\u2019s a double\u2011edged signal:\n- A stronger pound can weigh on parts of the FTSE 100 because many index heavyweights earn substantial revenues overseas (a stronger domestic currency reduces the translated value of foreign profits).\n- At the same time, sterling strength can be read as a confidence signal about the UK\u2019s near\u2011term macro path\u2014particularly heading into 2026, when investors expect a more active debate about the pace of global rate cuts. [11]\nMetals Mania Continues: Gold, Silver and Platinum Hit Records\nWhile the FTSE itself barely budged, the broader \u201crisk and hedges\u201d backdrop was anything but dull.\nLive market coverage on 24 December highlighted record highs in precious metals, including gold pushing above $4,500/oz, alongside record levels in silver and platinum. Commentary tied the move to a mix of geopolitical risk, heavy government debt burdens, and expectations for US interest rate cuts in 2026.

                "body": "Outlook 2026: Steepening yield curve, strong metals may push FTSE higher\nAs part of our series exploring the outlook for key financial instruments and markets in the year ahead, our market analyst Michael Kramer assesses what might come next for the FTSE 100 and GBP/USD, following a strong 2025 for both.\nAs part of our series exploring the outlook for key financial instruments and markets in the year ahead, our market analyst Michael Kramer assesses what might come next for the FTSE 100 and GBP/USD, following a strong 2025 for both.\nBoth the FTSE 100 and the British pound experienced a reasonably strong year, with the FTSE rising by approximately 20% and the pound gaining roughly 8% against the US dollar. This came despite a challenging economic backdrop, with the unemployment rate rising, inflation remaining elevated, and economic growth essentially stalling. Even so, the FTSE could continue to benefit through 2026, given its heavy weighting toward financials and its increased exposure to rising metal prices.\nHigher 10-year rates\nMuch of the outlook for both the pound and the FTSE is likely to be determined by the path of UK interest rates. UK 10-year gilt yields effectively stalled in 2025, moving largely sideways and remaining near their highest levels since 2008, reflecting a stagflation-like environment. This has occurred despite the Bank of England cutting rates six times since August 2024, and with markets currently pricing in one, and possibly two, additional rate cuts in 2026. That said, the rate-cutting cycle may be nearing its end.\nIf the cutting cycle is nearing completion as economic conditions begin to improve, UK 10-year yields could rise again in 2026. From a technical perspective, the 10-year gilt appears positioned for such a move. Yields have repeatedly struggled to break above 4.9%, but more importantly, price action suggests the potential formation of a pennant pattern. If this pattern resolves in line with the broader long-term uptrend, a sustained break above 4.9% could open the door to a move towards approximately 5.25%.\nUK Government Bonds 10YR yield & RSI chart\nSource: TradingView, 23 December 2025\nCould the FTSE rise further?\nA steeper yield curve would undoubtedly be positive for the FTSE, and more specifically for the financial sector within the index. In addition, the sharp rise in metals such as copper, silver, and gold could support higher revenues and profits for the mining sector, which in turn may help lift the broader UK equity market.\nFrom a technical perspective, the FTSE 100 has formed a bullish continuation pattern known as an ascending triangle. The index would need to break above 9,950 to confirm the breakout. If that occurs, the FTSE could move higher. Measuring the potential move from the base of the triangle to resistance suggests upside of roughly 7%, targeting around 10,620, which could provide a strong start to 2026.\nUK 100 index & RSI chart (Jul 2022-23 Dec 2025)\nSource: TradingView, 23 December 2025\nIf metals such as copper continue to move higher, as they did in 2025, this could provide further support to the FTSE 100 over the course of the year. Over time, the FTSE 100 has shown a strong relationship with copper prices, and with copper trading at record highs, this could bode well for the index.\nUK 100 index and RSI (Sep 2023-23 Dec 2025)\nSource: TradingView, 23 December 2025\nCopper could perform even better in 2026 if the US dollar continues to weaken. The dollar index has pared recent gains, and the British pound has clearly benefited as a result. GBP/USD has recently broken out of a downtrend and begun to move higher. The key test for the pound, however, lies around $1.355, a level at which it has struggled on several occasions in recent months.\nWill GBP/USD extend gains?\nFrom a technical perspective, what may matter more for the pound is that it has avoided a double-top pattern taking hold.

                "body": "December 24: Kalshi Debuts Research as CPI Markets Beat Wall Street\nKalshi has launched a research arm and opened its prediction markets data to academics, saying its CPI predictions beat Wall Street consensus by about 40% over the last 25 months when measured a week before releases. For German investors, better inflation forecasts can sharpen views on ECB policy, Bund yields, the euro, and DAX sector moves. If this edge holds, traders may rely more on market-based signals to prepare for key prints through 2026. We explain the impact, limits, and how to apply it today.\nWhat the new research arm means\nKalshi is sharing detailed event market data, methods, and documentation to let researchers test and replicate results. This transparency matters, since CPI predictions and forecast skill need independent checks. Early coverage highlights the academic angle and potential use in macro models, see Krypto News: Kalshi startet eigenes Research-Projekt. For investors, open datasets can improve trust and help separate genuine signal from noise in inflation forecasts.\nThe platform reports its CPI markets outperformed Wall Street consensus by about 40% over 25 months, measured one week before releases. That time window is practical for positioning. Odds from active traders may update faster when new data hits. Local coverage stresses data power and transparency, see Kalshi Startet Research-Projekt: Prognosemarkt Setzt Auf Datenpower. Still, independent replication will be key before broad adoption.\nImplications for German portfolios\nUS CPI moves global rates and risk appetite. If Kalshi odds lean hotter or cooler than economists, that can sway expectations for growth, energy, and cross-asset volatility seen in Europe. German investors can map these signals to ECB policy probabilities, since tighter US conditions often spill into euro-area financial conditions, even as the ECB follows its own mandate.\nA higher-probability hot print can argue for lighter duration, selective value tilt, and hedges in rate-sensitive names. A cooler setup can support longer duration and quality growth. Use options to contain risk. Translate CPI predictions into sector tilts, for example banks versus defensives, or adjust Bund futures and EUR exposure around the release window, always with clear stop rules.\nHow to use market-based CPI predictions\nStart with the market-implied path one week out. Define clear thresholds versus consensus, for example 0.2 percentage point above or below. Assign weights to bull, base, and bear cases from the odds. Tie each case to planned trades, target sizing, and exit triggers. Keep it simple so you can act fast on release day.\nCreate a calendar of major releases with decision times, pre-hedge windows, and post-print reviews. Combine Kalshi signals with euro-area data like PMIs, German CPI flash, and energy trends. Use small test size first, then scale if the edge holds over several months. Record slippage and PnL to verify real-world value.\nLimits to watch\nThe 25-month window is short. Energy shocks, supply chains, and policy can shift the inflation process. A signal that worked during one regime may fade in another. Basis risk is real, since US CPI is not the same as euro-area HICP. Treat any measured edge as provisional and diversify across signals.\nMany EU investors cannot trade Kalshi directly, so treat its pricing as an indicator, not a tool to execute. Liquidity can vary around events, which affects pricing quality. Always cross-check with swap markets, options skews, and survey data. No single feed should drive a major portfolio decision.\nFinal Thoughts\nKalshi is pushing prediction markets into the research spotlight, claiming better CPI predictions than Wall Street a week before releases. For German investors, that signal can guide rate exposure, equity sector tilts, and FX risk around key prints. The right approach is practical and humble. Build a calendar, convert probabilities into clear scenarios, predefine sizes and "

                "body": "Shares of Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ:PLTR) gained 3.54% over the past five trading sessions after gaining 1.59% the five prior. This year, the stock is up more than 158%, and since its October 2022 IPO, PLTR has surged an eye-catching 2,010.11%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Nov. 3, it beat on the top and bottom lines with EPS of 21 cents versus 17 cents expected, and revenue of $1.18 billion versus $1.09 billion expected. Palantir issued strong guidance, attributing growth to adoption of its AI software platform. Meanwhile, it announced that government sales \u2014 which have been essential to Palantir\u2019s rise \u2014 grew 52% from the same quarter a year ago.\nIn September, it was reported that the company agreed to a \u00a31.5 billion defense deal with the U.K. That comes not he back of an announcement in early August that the U.S. Army is consolidating 75 contracts into a single 10-year arrangement with Palantir valued at $10 billion. However, the so-called smart money have been selling the stock in flurries lately, leaving Palantir's institutional ownership at just 56.44%. JPMorgan, for example, recently reduced its position in PLTR by more than 32%, while T. Rowe Price reduced its position by nearly 24%.\nWhile the stock's forward P/E ratio of 192.14 can be concerning, Palantir's federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company's Q3 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders.\nHowever, PLTR's market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company \u2014 and from Wall Street analysts \u2014 is that earnings will continue to grow. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let\u2019s take a look at.\n24/7 Wall St. Insights:\nPalantir\u2019s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful.\nThe company\u2019s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\nWhy Invest in Palantir?\nThe AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion's share of that growth.\nNot only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed Army and ICE deals, as well as NATO\u2019s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump's emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confi"

                "body": "When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 19x, you may consider NVE Corporation (NASDAQ:NVEC) as a stock to potentially avoid with its 22.3x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nFor instance, NVE's receding earnings in recent times would have to be some food for thought. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think the company will still do enough to outperform the broader market in the near future. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\nWant the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then our free report on NVE will help you shine a light on its historical performance.\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as NVE's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 14%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 21% in aggregate. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nWeighing that medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 16% shows it's an unpleasant look.\nIn light of this, it's alarming that NVE's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent earnings trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\nThe Bottom Line On NVE's P/E\nWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\nWe've established that NVE currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its recent earnings have been in decline over the medium-term. When we see earnings heading backwards and underperforming the market forecasts, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NVE you should know about.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if NVE might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

It is chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump and vice-chaired by his vice-president, J.D. Vance. Trump appointed Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, to run its day-to-day operations as executive director. The task force\u2019s primary role is to lead and coordinate federal efforts in support of the tournament, notably across safety and security concerns.\nAdvertisement\nThe task force holds regular weekly calls with the 11 American host city committees, which are effectively subsidiaries of FIFA\u2019s U.S. operations. At one recent meeting, the task force invited a pitch from organizers of America\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations, which falls on July 4, 2026, at the start of the World Cup\u2019s round of 16. The \u2018Freedom\u2019 trucks were proposed to the host cities as a way to align the World Cup with America\u2019s Semiquincentennial, marking 250 years since the Declaration of Independence was signed.\nMajor FIFA Fan Fests have already been announced by several host cities across the United States, such as Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and a 25,000-person capacity Fan Fest at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Others, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, are considering a reduced slate of Fan Fests amid the major financial burden FIFA has transferred onto cities.\nSince his January inauguration, Trump has taken several steps to ramp up celebrations for \u2018America 250.\u2019 This included the establishment of the White House Task Force 250, which is also chaired by President Trump and includes representation from cabinet members. This month, Trump launched Freedom 250. He further announced that between June 25 and July 10, the U.S. will hold a Great American State Fair on the National Mall, \u201ccelebrating America\u2019s exceptional history and culture.\u201d\nHe also announced a national prayer event, \u201cto rededicate (America) as one nation under God\u201d, as well as a UFC event at the White House and the inaugural Patriot Games \u2014 a four-day athletic event involving one male and one female high school athlete from each U.S. state and territory. The Freedom 250 organization is described on its website as \u201cthe national, non-partisan organization leading the celebration of America\u2019s 250th birthday\u201d \u2014 it says it is the official public-private partnership to amplify presidential moments of the anniversary year.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, another organization, named America250, was created by Congress in 2016, charged with organizing the national commemoration, and this has bipartisan representation from Congress, as well as honorary presidency positions for former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and First Ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. However, the New York Times has reported that the organization has taken on a \u201cdifferent direction\u201d since Trump returned to the White House. The Atlantic reported that America250 had launched a partnership with Moms For Liberty, a conservative group, while also securing sponsorships with companies such as Palantir, UFC, Coinbase and Oracle, whose executives have financially supported Trump.\nOn the call with host city executives, it was explained that the large trailer trucks will be touring the United States in 2026, adorned with U.S. flags and the word Freedom. According to four people with knowledge of the call, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, these were described as mobile museum freedom trucks and airstream trailers, which would tell the story of America\u2019s history and independence. Two people said they expected the trucks to be 18-wheelers, but the size was not confirmed by the task"

Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration \u2014 which challenged the law under President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state's attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing \"illegal aliens over American citizens.\"\n\"As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,\" James said in a statement Friday. \"I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.\"\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\nThe law doesn't apply to commercial driver's licenses.\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration's arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\nThe administration, she wrote, has \"failed to state such a claim.\"\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\nUnder the law, people who don't have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver's licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a \"standard driver's license.\" It does not apply to commercial driver's licenses.\nThe Justice Department's lawsuit sought to strike down the law as \"a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\" It highlighted a provision that requires the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\nIn 2020, during Trump's first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn't let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn't prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers' access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York's driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk's earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information \"remains available to federal immigration authorities\" through a lawful court order or judicial warrant."

Optimism spread down the supply chain too, with Screen Holdings jumping after a broker boosted its price target.

Together, it\u2019s a reminder that domestic policy shifts can cut across the global chip-cycle story.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "TOKYO \u2014 Japanese equities ended slightly lower on Wednesday, December 24, 2025, as a stronger yen and holiday-thinned trading capped risk appetite, even while heavyweight semiconductor-related shares extended gains in line with Wall Street\u2019s tech momentum. [1]\nTokyo Stock Exchange close: Nikkei 225 dips, TOPIX falls more\nBy the close in Tokyo:\n- Nikkei 225 finished at 50,344.10, down 68.77 points (about -0.1%). [2]\n- TOPIX ended at 3,407.37, down 15.88 points (about -0.5%). [3]\nMarket commentary across the session repeatedly pointed to a familiar late-December setup: thin global liquidity ahead of Christmas, fewer offshore participants, and price action that could swing quickly on FX moves rather than on fresh domestic fundamentals. [4]\nThe yen was the day\u2019s swing factor \u2014 and exporters felt it\nA strengthening yen tends to pressure Japan\u2019s exporter-heavy benchmark because overseas earnings translate back into fewer yen. That dynamic reasserted itself Wednesday as the dollar hovered in the mid-155s against the yen, with traders increasingly alert to the risk of Japanese authorities stepping in to curb sharp, \u201cexcessive\u201d currency moves. [5]\nExport-oriented bellwethers reflected that pressure:\nBehind the currency move, the day\u2019s FX narrative was reinforced by broader dollar weakness: Reuters reported the U.S. dollar was on track for its worst year since 2003, with markets still leaning toward additional Fed cuts in 2026\u2014and strategists warning that year-end conditions can be a particularly \u201ccompelling backdrop\u201d for intervention risk in yen trading. [8]\nChips and semiconductors kept running, but couldn\u2019t save the broader market\nWhile exporters struggled, chip-related shares were a bright spot and helped explain why the Nikkei (price-weighted and tech-heavy) held up better than the broader TOPIX.\nKey movers highlighted in the Tokyo close:\n- Advantest rose 2.5%, adding a sizeable points contribution to the Nikkei. [9]\n- Tokyo Electron gained 0.7%. [10]\n- Screen Holdings surged about 10%, buoyed by a price-target raise from Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, and was flagged as the Nikkei\u2019s biggest percentage gainer. [11]\nThe sector tailwind was tied to U.S. leads: the Philadelphia semiconductor index advanced again overnight and the S&P 500 set another record high, keeping the global \u201cAI/tech bid\u201d intact even into the holiday lull. [12]\nA strategist at Nomura Securities summed up the tone succinctly: chip names were lifting the index, but with many overseas markets heading into holiday mode, big moves in Japanese equities looked unlikely. [13]\nFinancials cooled after last week\u2019s BOJ rate hike \u2014 a sign of rotation, not panic\nAnother theme in Wednesday\u2019s tape was pullback in financials after a strong run following the Bank of Japan\u2019s recent hike (which lifted rates to the highest level in roughly three decades).\nBy Wednesday\u2019s close:\nThis matters because higher rates can improve banks\u2019 earnings power over time, but the market often \u201cfront-runs\u201d that benefit\u2014then consolidates. Wednesday\u2019s move looked consistent with a giveback after a rate-driven rally, especially as investors watched the yen and considered how far the BOJ might go next. [16]\nBOJ minutes (released today) added nuance to the next-rate-hike debate\nOne of the most market-relevant Japan stories dated Dec. 24 was the publication of Bank of Japan minutes from the Oct. 29\u201330 meeting, which showed policymakers debating whether they should keep lifting rates toward a \u201cneutral\u201d level over time. [17]\nTwo points in the minutes stood out for markets:\n- Some members argued that gradually adjusting accommodation in line with improving conditions would help achieve long-run stability. [18]\n- Others warned that yen weakness could push inflation above expectations by raising import costs\u2014tying FX volatility directly to the policy path. [19]\nAlthough the October meeting kept rates unchanged at that time, the minutes also underscored that conditions were already being viewed by many as \u201cripe\u201d"
