The appointment has been closely watched in the context of Trump\u2019s ongoing conflict with the Fed and its current chairman Jerome Powell.\nThe immediate reaction to the announcement was a significant crash in gold and silver markets. After months of record highs and stretched valuations, spot prices for gold and silver dropped 9% and 28% respectively after the announcement. The US stock market also fell, with major indexes all reporting modest losses.\nHowever, in the context of concerns over Trump\u2019s interference with the Fed, the market crash can ironically be understood as an early vote of confidence in Warsh\u2019s independence and suitability for the role.\nUnderstanding why requires the context of Trump\u2019s ongoing conflict with the Federal Reserve, and the importance of central bank independence to our current global financial system.\nTrump\u2019s war with the Fed\nThe last year has seen Trump in an unprecedented conflict with the Federal Reserve.\nTrump appointed current Chairman Jerome Powell back in 2017. However, the relationship quickly soured when Powell did not cut interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted. In characteristically colourful language, Trump has since called Powell a \u201cclown\u201d with \u201csome real mental problems\u201d, adding \u201cI\u2019d love to fire his ass\u201d.\nThe war of words descended into legal threats. Trump\u2019s Justice Department announced an investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged fraud in historical mortgage documents. Then last month, in a shocking escalation the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Powell relating to overspending in renovations of the Federal Reserve offices.\nBoth sets of allegations are widely viewed as baseless. However, Trump has tried to use the investigation as grounds to fire Cook. The case is currently before the Supreme Court.\nPowell has hit back strongly at Trump, saying the legal threats were\na consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\nPowell received support from 14 international central bank chiefs, who noted \u201cthe independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability\u201d.\nHistorically, presidential interference with the Fed was a major cause of the stagflation crisis in the 1970s. More recently, both Argentina and Turkey have experienced significant financial crises caused by interference with central bank independence.\nWho is Kevin Warsh?\nKevin Warsh is a former banker and Federal Reserve governor, who previously served as economic advisor to both President George W Bush and President Trump.\nOriginally Trump seemed likely to favour the current director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, for the job. However, Hassett was widely viewed as being too influenced by Trump, intensifying fears about Fed independence.\nWarsh appears more independent and brings a reputation as an inflation \u201chawk\u201d.\nWhat is an inflation hawk?\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for setting US interest rates.

Central bank independence is essential to ensure this delicate task is guided by the best evidence and long-term needs of the economy, rather than the short-term political goals.\nAn inflation \u201chawk\u201d refers to a central banker who prioritises fighting inflation, compared to a \u201cdove\u201d who prioritises growth and jobs.\nFrom Warsh\u2019s previous time at the Federal Reserve, he established a strong reputation as an inflation hawk.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 179 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%.\nThe value of the U.S. dollar rallied, but only after swiveling a couple times following Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh.

Such decisions lift or weigh on prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the U.S. job market humming without letting inflation get out of control. Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates, which usually help goose the economy but can also cause higher inflation.\nA fear in financial markets has been that the Fed will lose some of its independence because of Trump. That fear in turn helped catapult the price of gold and weaken the U.S. dollar\u2019s value over the last year.\nThe longtime assumption has been that the Fed should operate separately from the rest of Washington so that it can make moves that are painful in the short term but necessary for the long term. To get inflation down to the Fed\u2019s goal of 2%, for example, may require the unpopular choice to keep interest rates high and grind down on the economy for a while.\nThe big question is what Warsh\u2019s nomination, which still requires approval from the Senate, means for the Fed\u2019s independence.\nWarsh used to be a governor on the Fed\u2019s board, so investors are familiar with him. That could also mean Warsh is familiar with and hopes to continue the institution of the Fed as an independent operator. And while with the Fed, Warsh criticized the central bank\u2019s buying of bonds to keep interest rates low.\nSome on Wall Street took Warsh\u2019s nomination as an encouraging signal for a still-independent Fed that will keep rates high, if necessary. Besides slowing the economy, higher interest rates would push downward on stock prices.\nBut Warsh has also recently been critical of the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell, and has voiced support for lower rates.\n\u201cIndeed, Warsh is not the Fed\u2019s guy, he is Trump\u2019s guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009,\u201d according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie Group. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Warsh will push the Fed into rate cuts soon,\u201d but it could indicate he may be quicker to do so when the time comes.\nOn Wall Street, stocks of metals miners tumbled as the price of gold dropped 11.4% to settle at $4,745.10 per ounce. Gold\u2019s price suddenly ran out of momentum following a tremendous rally where it roughly doubled over 12 months. It topped $5,000 for the first time on Monday and was around $5,600 at one point on Thursday.\nSilver, which had been on a similar, jaw-dropping tear, fell even more. It plunged 31.4%.\nPrices for gold and other precious metals had been surging as investors looked for safer places for their money while weighing a wide range of risks, including a potentially less independent Fed, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide.\nThe dramatic halt may have been inevitable given how far and how fast metal prices had surged over the last year. Nothing goes up in price forever.\nFriday\u2019s drops for metals prices helped send the stock of miner Newmont down 11.5%.

                "body": "Oil prices are likely to hold near the $60 a barrel mark this year, as the prospect of oversupply in the market offsets the impact of geopolitical tensions that could disrupt cargoes, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.\nThe survey of 31 economists and analysts conducted in January forecast that Brent crude would average $62.02 per barrel in 2026, slightly up from December's forecast of $61.27. Brent was trading around $70 on January 30 and averaged around $68.20 last year.\nU.S. crude is projected to average $58.72 per barrel, compared with December's estimate of $58.15. Prices averaged $64.73 in 2025.\nGeopolitics are at the fore following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to Iran, expanded sanctions on Russia, and unrest across the Middle East. All pose supply risks.\nHowever, analysts said U.S. trade policy shifts, China\u2019s demand trajectory, and OPEC+\u2019s next steps will also steer prices this year.\n\"Geopolitics brings lots of noise but neither the events in Venezuela nor Iran should ultimately alter the big picture. The oil market appears to be in a lasting surplus,\" said Norbert Ruecker, head of economics & next generation research at Julius Baer.\nAnalysts expect that surplus to range from 0.75 to 3.5 million barrels per day.\nAnalysts broadly expect it to take years for any major increase in production from Venezuela after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\nKpler anticipates Venezuelan supply will dip through April because of the U.S. crackdown on tankers under sanctions, but that it will rebound in the second half of the year as existing infrastructure is reactivated.\nAny increases in oil production beyond this will require sustained investment, prolonged political stability, the replacement of ageing infrastructure and the backing of international firms, Kpler added.\nOPEC+, which meets on Sunday, is unlikely to take any decisions beyond March at the meeting, three OPEC+ delegates told Reuters.\nThe eight members raised oil output targets by around 2.9 million barrels per day last year, but paused those hikes for the first quarter of 2026.\n\"OPEC+ will defend a price floor while also watching its market share. If consumption grows enough, the coalition could carefully increase output to meet rising demand without flooding the market,\" said Cyrus De La Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank."

India is coming and will buy oil from Venezuela, not from Iran.\nThe concept of this deal with India has been finalised.\u201d He also added that China could also purchase Venezuelan oil if it wished to do so.\nIndia had stopped importing oil from Venezuela after 2019, following the imposition of strict economic sanctions by the United States on the South American country.\nIn 2019, the US introduced secondary sanctions on Venezuela, which meant that any country or company buying oil from Venezuela could face restrictions on trading in the US market or accessing US banking facilities.\nAs a result, many countries, including India, temporarily halted their purchases of Venezuelan crude.\nReports indicate that India used to source approximately 6% of its total oil imports from Venezuela before these sanctions.\nVenezuela, a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, yet it contributes only about 1% of the global oil supply.\nIndia, meanwhile, is the third-largest oil consumer globally, making its import strategies highly significant for international energy markets.\nAfter partial easing of US sanctions in 2023\u20132024, India resumed purchasing Venezuelan crude.\nAccording to data, in 2024, India\u2019s imports from Venezuela averaged 63,000 to 1 lakh barrels per day, rising in 2025 to about $1.41 billion worth of crude.\nHowever, renewed restrictions imposed by the U.S. in May 2025 drastically reduced India\u2019s Venezuelan oil imports to just 0.3% by early 2026.\nReliance Industries seeks US approval to resume Venezuelan oil purchases\nPrivate Indian company Reliance Industries, which operates the world\u2019s largest refinery complex in Gujarat with a capacity of approximately 1.4 million barrels per day, has reportedly initiated steps to seek US approval to resume buying crude from Venezuela.\nAccording to Reuters, Reliance\u2019s efforts are motivated by pressure from Western countries to reduce India\u2019s oil imports from Russia and the company\u2019s desire to secure alternative crude supplies.\nSources say Reliance representatives are currently in talks with both the US State Department and the US Treasury Department regarding the required approvals. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.\nReliance had previously imported Venezuelan crude under a US license, receiving shipments via four vessels in early 2025, averaging 63,000 barrels per day.\nHowever, following the US suspension of most Venezuelan oil licenses and threats of tariffs, Reliance\u2019s last shipment from Venezuela arrived in May 2025.\nThe company stated that it would reconsider future Venezuelan purchases if non-US buyers were permitted to continue under US regulations.\nTrump on Venezuela oil for the US Market\nEarlier, Trump announced that Venezuela\u2019s interim president would hand over 3 to 5 crore barrels of crude oil to the US, which would be sold at market price, with Trump stating he would have control over the proceeds.\nThe current value of 5 crore barrels of oil is estimated at \u20b925,000 crore, which Trump claimed would be used \u201cin the interest of the people of Venezuela and America.\u201d\nContext: India-Venezuela oil trade and global implications\nIndia historically imported a substantial portion of its crude oil fr"

                "body": "As we begin 2026, the US remains the world\u2019s largest producer of crude oil, averaging about 13.6 million B/D in 2025. While growth appears to be slowing and output is expected to drop modestly to 13.5 million B/D in 2026, according to recent figures from the US Energy Information Administration, the US has nonetheless reminded us that exploiting fossil fuels is not the ultimate problem.\nThe bigger challenge is how we minimize or eliminate emissions while meeting global energy needs.\nIn 2019, I wrote about our industry\u2019s quest for operational efficiency and last year I described an artificial intelligence (AI) shockwave. Today, I believe we are also witnessing the convergence of shale and silicon logic, driven by what is now called the Fifth Industrial Revolution.\nThis new era is one in which human ingenuity and machine reasoning will coevolve to confront the dual challenge of energy security and environmental responsibility. The effort will be guided by the twin imperatives of stewardship and ecocentrism.\nTo understand what makes this shift a key part of the Fifth Industrial Revolution, consider the arc of industrial progress.\nThe First Industrial Revolution introduced mechanization through steam power. The second harnessed electric power to enable mass production. The third brought digital computing and automation. The fourth, which I described in 2019, linked the digital and physical worlds through the industrial internet of things, cloud computing, and advanced analytics.\nThe fifth transcends connectivity with autonomous agents that perceive, learn, and act. With these systems, humans and machines collaborate to solve previously intractable problems. In oil and gas, this means advancing from digitally assisted operations to self-optimizing systems that balance competing objectives in real time.\nThis article explores how that transformation is unfolding, what it means for our profession, and why it represents this pivotal moment. The impact of AI on oil and gas has accelerated through three distinct waves, each building upon the last, with the third wave defining the Fifth Industrial Revolution itself.\nAI\u2019s Third Wave: Agents, Autonomy, and Adaptation\nThe first wave of AI, from 2015 to 2020, built the physical foundation. This involved specialized chips and cloud infrastructure that enabled large-scale machine learning. A second wave from 2020 to 2024 centered on the capabilities made possible by large language models (LLMs) and generative AI-powered by graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration that expanded what machines could create, from automated reporting to the synthesis of realistic data.\nThe third wave, from 2024 to present, has been described by some to be about agency. This involves autonomous digital systems that plan, act, and learn continuously without explicit instruction.\nAn AI agent is not only a model that answers questions, but one that is also capable of handling key tasks without constant supervision. These routines include monitoring conditions, retrieving relevant information, performing analyses, and adapting strategies as new data arrive.\nFor example, a drilling agent might search technical literature, perform optimization using specialized numerical tools, and simulate well trajectories in a reservoir-modeling software. It can refine its approach continuously as new information emerges. In essence, an agent delivers value by solving multistep problems and running workflows that once required teams of specialists.\nFrom Sense\u2013Interpret\u2013Compute\u2013Act to Pretrain\u2013Post-Train\u2013Infer\nFor decades, our workflow followed a strict sequence: sense, interpret, compute, and act. Seismic surveys and wireline logs provided raw data, then engineers interpreted them, models predicted outcomes, and finally, operators acted on results. Each step awaited the previous one in a disciplined chain of causality.\nAI reshapes this sequence with pretraining, post-training, and inference. This routine is also inherently sequential"

                "body": "Trump Refilling Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u2013 Big Oil Could Benefit\nThe U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford. It was established in response to the 1973-1974 oil embargo, which highlighted the U.S. economy's vulnerability to oil supply disruptions. Those who were around at the time, like your author, witnessed long lines at the gas stations as the price of a gallon of gas jumped as much as 43%. In fact, the national average cost of gas rose from about $0.385 per gallon in October 1973 to $0.551 per gallon in June 1974. Under President Biden's administration, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve released more than 200 million barrels of oil, primarily through emergency sales in 2022. The most significant release was 180 million barrels in response to supply disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While a difficult situation, most feel that this was not what the SPR was created for.\nOil prices fell below $60 per barrel recently due to a combination of oversupply and weak demand. Global oil inventories are rising, putting downward pressure on prices. At the same time, both OPEC+ and U.S. production are increasing amid relatively stable global oil demand. Some banks expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil Prices to Be Below $60 for the remainder of 2025. OPEC+ recently announced plans to unwind its production cuts; the increases are lower than those initially proposed. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the price of crude oil to fall below the current $60 per barrel by the end of the year and average near $50 per barrel through 2026, as more supply is added to an already well-supplied market.\nWith benchmarks hitting 2025 lows and reaching levels not seen since 2021, it makes sense for investors to consider buying some of the biggest and best mega-cap integrated leaders. Five stocks make sense now; all pay dependable dividends, and all are rated Buy at major Wall Street firms.\nBP\nThis company is one of the premier European integrated oil giants, paying shareholders a substantial 5.71% dividend. BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) engages in the energy business worldwide.\nIt operates through:\nGas & Low Carbon Energy\nOil Production & Operations\nCustomers & Products\nRosneft segments\nBP produces and trades natural gas, offers biofuels, operates onshore and offshore wind and solar power generating facilities, and provides decarbonization solutions and services, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, usage, and storage.\nThe company is also involved in the convenience and mobility business, which includes managing the sale of fuels to wholesale and retail customers, convenience products, aviation fuels, and Castrol lubricants; refining, supplying, and trading of oil products; and operating electric vehicle charging facilities.\nIn addition, it produces and refines oil and gas and invests in upstream, downstream, and alternative energy companies. It also invests in advanced mobility, bio and low-carbon products, carbon management, digital transformation, and power and storage areas.\nBerenberg Bank has a Buy rating, but we could not find a target price in U.S. dollars.\nChevron\nChevron Corporation is an American multinational energy company primarily focused on oil and gas. This integrated giant is a safer option for investors looking to position themselves in the energy sector, paying a substantial 4.40% dividend, which was raised by 5% earlier this year.

The US dollar fell to multi-year lows before recovering. The dollar faced geopolitical concerns and concerns about Fed independence. However, the sentiment improved after President Trump and the Senate avoided a potential government shutdown.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Bitcoin price prediction? Check our detailed guide-\nMoreover, the nomination of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair also helped stabilize the dollar, as markets saw it as supportive of central?bank autonomy.\nUS data sent mixed signals as factory orders beat expectations, but initial jobless claims rose, and the trade deficit widened. Also, Producer Price Index figures showed sticky inflation, with stronger-than-forecast PPI and Core PPI readings.\nThis reinforced the view that the Fed will be cautious about cutting rates aggressively. Comments from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic underlined that inflation is still too high and that the Fed should be patient, keeping the bar high for near-term easing.\nIn the Eurozone, fundamentals were modestly supportive for the euro. Eurozone Q4 GDP and German GDP exceeded forecasts, pointing to a still?resilient, if modest, growth backdrop. German inflation hovered close to the ECB\u2019s target, with HICP and core measures broadly stable.\nAnalysts at Rabobank, TD Securities, and Brown Brothers Harriman expect the ECB to keep the deposit rate around 2.00% for an extended period. They see little urgency for cuts or hikes, even as the euro\u2019s strength raises some concerns about competitiveness.\nOn the other hand, strategists at Nordea and UOB highlight the risk of a multi-year US dollar down cycle. Historical patterns of prolonged dollar declines after peaks and shifting foreign?investor behavior support this view. Their projections see room for further EUR/USD gains over the coming years, provided Eurozone growth and inflation remain contained, and the ECB stays broadly steady.\nEUR/USD Key Events Next Week:\nNext week, EUR/USD traders will focus on a dense calendar of high-impact releases:\n- ECB Refinancing Rate and Press Conference\n- US ISM Manufacturing/Services PMIs\n- JOLTs Job Openings\n- ADP Non-Farm Employment Change\n- Average Hourly Earnings m/m\n- US Unemployment Rate\n- Preliminary UoM Consumer Sentiment\n- Preliminary UoM Inflation Expectations\nThe ECB is widely expected to maintain rates, with a cautious, data-dependent tone, with any pushback against euro strength watched closely. On the US side, labor-market data and wages will be crucial for refining the Fed\u2019s rate expectations. Any considerable surprise in NFP or unemployment could trigger sharp EUR/USD moves as markets reassess the relative policy outlooks.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Corrective Downside Under 1.19\nThe EUR/USD daily chart shows a correction from more than 4-year highs above 1.2000. The pair fell back below the broken supply zone, correcting below the 1.1900 mark. The RSI is now off the overbought region, gradually retreating, revealing underlying weakness. However, the key MAs remain bullish, providing strong support for the pair.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers?

Instead of a calm grind higher, we are seeing choppy swings, sharp intraday reversals, and a constant battle between German value buyers and global macro bears. The index is hovering in a tense zone where every ECB headline, every German industrial data point, and every move in the euro-dollar pair can flip sentiment from cautious optimism to outright panic.\nThis is not a sleepy sideways market. Volatility is back, intraday ranges are wide, and the German benchmark is repeatedly testing important zones rather than exploding into clear new trends. Traders are forced to decide: is this controlled consolidation before another push higher, or the topping phase before a painful correction?\nThe Story: To understand what is really driving the DAX right now, you need to zoom out beyond just candles and indicators and look at the macro narrative swirling around Europe.\n1. ECB Policy and Rate Expectations\nAll eyes are on the European Central Bank. After a historic tightening cycle, the market is obsessing over the timing and size of potential rate cuts. Traders are flipping between two core storylines:\n- Dovish Hope: If inflation keeps cooling and growth stays weak, the ECB will be forced to lean more dovish. That is classic bullish fuel for equities, especially rate-sensitive sectors like tech and real estate, and for the highly cyclical German exporters that love lower yields and a weaker euro.\n- Stagflation Fear: If price pressures remain sticky while growth stays sluggish, the ECB is trapped. That stagflation narrative is poison for risk assets and hits European indices harder than US markets because Europe is more exposed to energy and manufacturing shocks.\nRight now, the DAX is trading in between those two extremes. Every ECB speech, every hint from Christine Lagarde, every inflation print is treated like a mini event. That is why you see violent intraday swings after press conferences and macro releases: algos and day traders pile in, while longer-term investors hesitate.\n2. Germany\u2019s Industrial Machine Under Pressure\nGermany\u2019s old-school engine \u2013 autos, machinery, chemicals, industrials \u2013 is still under stress. Headlines around the German auto industry, from electric vehicle transition costs to global competition and slower Chinese demand, are weighing on the big blue chips. When news flow around VW, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or key suppliers turns negative, the entire DAX feels it.\nAt the same time, weak or mixed manufacturing data and ongoing recession chatter in Europe are capping euphoria. Traders know the DAX is heavily cyclical. When global growth anxiety rises, the German benchmark does not get the same safe-haven love as the US mega-cap tech complex.\nBut here is the twist: exactly this pessimism is what creates the opportunity. When everyone hates Europe, valuations get compressed, dividend yields become attractive, and long-term investors start quietly accumulating. That under-the-surface demand helps explain why every ugly selloff in the DAX so far has been met with equally aggressive dip-buying.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar: Silent Driver of DAX Flows\nDo not sleep on the currency. The euro-dollar pair is a silent puppet master behind many DAX moves:\n- A weaker euro tends to support German exporters, as their products become more competitive globally and foreign revenues translate into more euros. That often softens the blow when global risk sentiment is shaky.\n- A stronger euro can be a headwind for corporate margins and earnings expectations, especially when global demand is not booming.\nRecently, the euro has b"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is currently in a classic tug-of-war phase: not a euphoric moonshot, not a panic crash, but a nervy zone where every candle matters. Price action is reflecting a cautious grind after previous volatility, with sessions that swing between hopeful green rallies and quick profit-taking as soon as strength shows up. Think of it as a high-wire act between lingering recession fears and renewed optimism about German industry stabilising.\nThe index has been oscillating near important zones that traders watch as psychological battlegrounds. The character of the tape: choppy, headline-sensitive, and heavily driven by macro narratives rather than just company specifics. When European futures open, you can almost feel algos scanning every ECB quote and every US yield move before deciding if German blue chips deserve another bid.\nThe Story: What is driving this whole DAX story right now? Three big forces: the European Central Bank, the German industrial machine, and the global risk-on vs risk-off pendulum.\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 the oxygen of the rally\nThe ECB remains the single biggest macro driver for the DAX. After a cycle of aggressive tightening to fight inflation, the new narrative is shifting toward how long they will keep rates restrictive and when a proper easing cycle might kick in. Every statement from Frankfurt is parsed like a legal contract: a slightly softer tone on growth or inflation can ignite a green push in European equities, especially in rate-sensitive sectors like tech, real estate, and some industrial exporters.\nBut here is the catch: the ECB is walking a tight line. Inflation has cooled from its extreme peaks, but it is not completely defeated, and energy remains a wild card. If policymakers sound too dovish, the euro may come under pressure against the US dollar, which can be a short-term tailwind for DAX exporters but also a sign of the market doubting Europe\u2019s growth engine. If they sound too hawkish, equity markets fear a deeper slowdown. This balancing act is exactly why the DAX is trading in a zone of hesitation rather than a one-way moonshot.\n2. German Economy \u2013 from laggard to maybe-not-so-bad\nGermany has been the problem child of Europe recently: weak manufacturing PMI readings, soft industrial orders, and constant chatter about a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d or \u201cstagnation trap.\u201d The auto giants, machine builders, and chemical titans that define the DAX are extremely cyclical and heavily exposed to global demand. Slower growth in China, uncertainty around global trade, and higher energy costs have all acted as steady headwinds.\nNow, the story is shifting from pure doom to a more nuanced picture. Markets are starting to price in that the worst of the contraction fears might be behind us, or at least that the pace of decline is slowing. If new data show stabilisation in industrial production, improved business sentiment surveys, or rebound signs from export partners, then the DAX can justify a continued grind higher. But any fresh disappointment \u2013 weak factory data, new geopolitical shocks, or renewed energy spikes \u2013 can quickly flip sentiment back toward the bears.\n3. Euro vs Dollar \u2013 the hidden DAX lever\nThe euro-dollar pair is a stealth driver of German equities. A softer euro often supports DAX exporters because their products become more competitive globally and foreign revenues translate into more euros. A stronger euro, on the other hand, can squeeze margins and dampen enthusiasm for the export-heavy index.\nAt the moment, the currency dynamic is less about European strength and more ab"

                "body": "The US dollar recovered modestly after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and struck a slightly more confident tone on growth, although political risks and White House pressure continue to cap any sustained rebound.\nPound to Dollar (GBP/USD): 1.36844\nEuro to Dollar (EUR/USD): 1.18501\nDollar to Japanese Yen (USD/JPY): 154.7785\nUS Dollar Recovers as Fed Hold Rates Steady\nWednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting offered few surprises. Rates were held steady as expected.\nThe US dollar bounced as the Fed outlined a positive outlook for the economy and no pressing need for further cuts.\nHowever, the USD is being pressured by Trump\u2019s policies and this may only be a temporary recovery in the downtrend.\nMarkets remain volatile, with precious metals surging, and oil breaking higher to 4-month highs due to escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran.\nThis week has brought a series of stark warnings from President Donald Trump, who suggested that a previous strike on Iranian sites in June was merely a precursor to potentially far more severe actions.\n\"The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,\" Trump wrote in a social media post, adding that a \"massive Armada\" was heading toward the region.\nThis aggressive posturing has sent shockwaves through the oil markets, driving crude prices higher on supply disruption fears.\nWeekend risks are rising as military resources are being positioned for a potential large attack, although no final decision has been made.\nAllies in the Middle East have urged against military intervention, but the financial world is pricing in a significant risk premium.\nAgainst this backdrop, Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting was a rather uneventful affair as rates were held steady and a slight hawkish tone was absorbed by well-prepared markets.\nIt helped the US dollar recover slightly, but it is still well down for the week.\nFOMC In No Rush to Cut Again\nThe Federal Reserve concluded its first policy meeting of 2026 against a backdrop of market turbulence and a weakening U.S. dollar.\nRates were held steady with a 10-2 majority vote, with 2 votes for an immediate cut coming from well-known doves.\nStephen Miran is a governor appointed by President Trump, who has consistently voted for deeper rate cuts in recent meetings, while Christopher Waller also voted for a cut and seems to be positioning himself for a potential candidacy for the next Fed chair.\nIn his post-meeting press conference, Powell faced immediate questions regarding the dollar\u2019s slide to four-year lows.\nThis follows President Trump\u2019s recent dismissal of concerns over the currency's value, where he stated, \"No, the dollar is doing great,\" while simultaneously suggesting it should \"seek its own level.\"\nPowell avoided direct commentary on the administration's rhetoric but emphasized that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\nThe fate of the dollar, he said, is a concern for the Treasury, not the Fed. He also dodged questions on criminal charges brought against him.\nThere was a slight hawkish and change to the statement, brought on by stabilization in the labour market and a strong economy.\nThe Fed have recently cut rates three times, so there is no pressing need for further easing. As ING noted,\n\u201cThe key takeaway is a slightly hawkish twist to the accompanying statement and press conference. At the December FOMC meeting, officials stated that \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months,\" but chose to remove that line today.\nOther than that, growth is described as \u201csolid\u201d while they acknowledge \u201csome signs of stabilisation\u201d in the unemployment rate.\u201d\nMarkets had already prepared for this and stocks barely moved throughout Wednesday\u2019s session, while the US dollar recovered, but from oversold levels so it may only be a bounce in a downwards trend.\nA strong economy and a central bank nearing the end of their cutting cycle should be a stabilizing force, but Trump\u2019s weak dollar policy and errat"

The pair fell 0.19% in the previous session, settling on Thursday at 153.12. On Friday at 21:00 UTC, USD/JPY traded+1.08% at 154.77 and traded in a range of 152.87 to 154.81.\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply on Friday after Tokyo inflation cooled by more than expected. Tokyo consumer inflation slowed to 1.5% year on year in January, falling below 2% for the first time since October 2024.\nThe decline was mainly due to lower food and energy prices. Core inflation excluding fresh food and energy eased to 2.4%.\nWhilst headline inflation is expected to decline further over the year, the Bank of Japan is expected to prioritise core and underlying inflation trends. If these remain above 2% and wage growth is steady, the central bank could hike rates further.\nThe U.S. dollar rose across the board. The US dollar index, which measures the USD against a basket of currencies, rose 0.74% on Friday to 96.99, after losses on Thursday. The USD fell across the week.\nThe U.S. dollar rebounded sharply on Friday, recovering from a four-year low reached earlier in the week.\nThe dollar recovered after President Trump announced Kevin Warsh to be the next Federal Reserve chair, replacing Jerome Powell when his term ends in May\nKevin Warsh was previously known as a hawk; however, his position has shifted and is now more aligned with Trump\u2019s wishes to lower borrowing costs. However, Warsh also believes in shrinking the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.\nAs well as digesting the announcement of the next Fed chair, economic data showed that the producer price index rose 0.5% last month, well above the 0.2% expected, following an unrevised 0.2% gain in November. This suggests that businesses are passing on the higher cost from import tariffs."

                "body": "January 31: Gold and Silver Plunge as Warsh Fed Bets Rattle Metals\nSilver price today is under pressure after a sharp swing on January 31, as reports that Kevin Warsh may be favored for the next Fed chair lifted the US dollar and hit gold silver prices. The pullback followed record highs earlier in the week and shows how sensitive metals are to policy expectations. For Australian investors, this is a timely reminder to focus on currency moves, liquidity, and risk controls while the market reassesses the odds of a rapid rate-cut path.\nWhat changed in markets\nReports that Kevin Warsh could be a leading candidate for Fed chair nudged markets to price a more hawkish policy stance. The dollar firmed and real yields ticked higher, a negative setup for precious metals. This narrative helped reverse a crowded long trade. For background on how the speculation hit sentiment, see the AFR analysis here.\nA strong dollar and higher yields can force trend followers to exit quickly. That is what we saw as silver price today fell alongside gold, snapping from record territory into a swift slide. Liquidity thinned, spreads widened, and dealers pulled quotes. Local headlines captured the break in gold silver prices, with coverage from the ABC summarising the crash here.\nImplications for Australian investors\nFor local buyers, AUD movement matters as much as spot. A softer AUD can cushion US dollar price declines, while a stronger AUD can magnify them. Silver price today in AUD terms may look less severe than in USD if the currency weakens. Always compare USD and AUD charts and check the basis used by your broker or ETF issuer.\nExpect heightened volatility in ASX-listed gold and silver ETFs and in local miners with high operating leverage. During fast moves, intraday net asset value gaps can appear, and market-makers may widen spreads. Silver price today can also drive margin calls in CFDs or futures. Use limit orders, monitor indicative iNAVs, and verify borrow availability before shorting or hedging positions.\nHow to trade the next 2 weeks\nFocus on execution quality first. Use smaller position sizes, stagger entries, and avoid market orders when spreads balloon. If silver price today breaks recent support on rising volume, consider waiting for a base to form. Options traders can explore defined-risk strategies, but implied volatility may be elevated, reducing the appeal of naked premium buying.\nThe main driver is the Fed leadership outlook and how it shifts rate expectations. Any confirmation or pushback on Kevin Warsh Fed chair chatter can move gold silver prices quickly. Watch US labour data, ISM, and inflation prints, plus RBA commentary. For Australia, track AUD, local ETF flows, and quarterly updates from major producers for cost and grade trends.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis week\u2019s reversal shows how quickly sentiment can flip when policy expectations change. A stronger dollar and firmer real yields pressured gold and silver, and silver price today reflects that stress across futures, ETFs, and local equities. For Australian investors, the practical playbook is simple. Compare USD and AUD pricing, use limit orders during thin liquidity, and scale positions rather than going all in. Keep risk defined with stop losses or options, and revisit portfolio hedges as volatility rises. Finally, watch the Fed chair news flow and key macro data. Policy headlines can reset fair value fast, so preparation beats prediction. Build a checklist and act only when your signals align.\nFAQs\nWhy did gold and silver drop so quickly?\nMarkets repriced the odds of a more hawkish Fed after reports suggested Kevin Warsh could be favored as chair. That pushed the US dollar and real yields higher, which typically weighs on precious metals. Positioning was crowded, so stops and de-leveraging accelerated the move, creating a fast, liquidity-thin decline.\nHow does the AUD affect silver price today for Australians?\nAustralians see metal costs in AUD, not just USD. If the AUD weaken"

                "body": "USD/JPY extended its losing streak in a choppy week, with the BoJ, intervention, warnings, and Trump\u2019s Fed Chair nomination fueling market volatility.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s upward revisions to GDP and inflation projections, a hawkish BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, and yen intervention threats sent USD/JPY to a weekly low of 152.092 in the week ending January 30.\nHowever, softer Japanese economic data, sticky US producer prices, and President Trump\u2019s nomination for Fed Chair led to a partial recovery. USD/JPY ended the week down 0.64% at 154.750, below the crucial 155 level.\nLast week\u2019s drop below 155, expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts, and a hawkish BoJ rate path support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, the Bank of Japan, Japanese economic data, and political headlines will influence buying interest in the yen. Key economic indicators include finalized PMI numbers and household spending figures.\nPreliminary manufacturing and service sector PMIs signaled a sharp pickup in economic momentum, supporting a hawkish BoJ policy stance. Upward revisions to the preliminary PMIs would reinforce the BoJ\u2019s positive economic outlook. These factors raised expectations of an H1 2026 rate hike. A more hawkish BoJ rate path would boost yen demand, sending USD/JPY lower.\nMeanwhile, December\u2019s household spending figures will face scrutiny after retail sales unexpectedly fell at the end of 2025. Economists expect household spending to fall 1.3% month-on-month after surging 6.2% in November.\nA larger-than-expected fall in household spending would offset the pickup in service sector consumption, cooling bets on an April BoJ rate hike. For context, private consumption contributes around 55% to Japan\u2019s GDP, while the services sector accounts for roughly 70% of GDP.\nHowever, the BoJ\u2019s concerns over yen weakness driving import prices higher may lead to hawkish rhetoric. Typically, rising import prices fuel inflationary pressures, eroding households\u2019 spending power. Policymakers want to avoid the combination of rising inflation and weakening domestic demand, which would adversely impact the economy and trigger price instability.\nWhile the economic data will be key, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions will give insights into the requirements for a rate hike. The BoJ will release its Summary of Opinions on Monday, February 2.\nIncreased optimism that tariff risks have abated, wage growth will continue to accelerate, and the economy and prices will move in line with projections would support a hawkish policy stance.\nTraders should also consider any references to the Bank of Japan\u2019s neutral rate, neither accommodative nor restrictive. A higher neutral rate (potentially 1.5% \u2013 2%) would indicate multiple BoJ rate hikes and a sharply narrower US-Japan rate differential.\nNarrowing rate differentials would push USD/JPY lower. Importantly, these scenarios could trigger a yen carry trade unwind as seen in mid-2024, exposing USD/JPY to sub-140.\nMeanwhile, traders also need to consider the broader economic picture, not just an isolated drop in consumer spending and January\u2019s softer inflation numbers.\nSteady labor market conditions, improved external demand for Japanese goods, and higher wages would lift consumer sentiment. Rising sentiment would drive spending, bolstering the economy, while fueling demand-driven inflation. These dynamics support a more hawkish BoJ rate path, weighing on USD/JPY.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nJapan\u2019s national election will be another market focal point, as voters go to the polls on February 8. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap election in January, looking to leverage her strong personal approval ratings to gain a firmer footing in the lower house.\nA strong election win would give the Japanese Prime Minister greater "

Two governors argued for a 25 bp cut, but the majority emphasised \u201csolid\u201d economic growth, a labour market that has only \u201cstabilised\u201d rather than cracked, and inflation that remains \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d despite progress. The Dollar Index rebounded toward 96.70 after recently touching four-year lows, while USD/JPY pushed toward 153.9\u2013154.5, gaining close to 1% on the day as yields ticked higher across the curve and US equities reacted in mixed fashion, with the S&P 500 printing a record intraday high near 7,002.28, the Nasdaq edging up about 0.3% and the Dow nearly flat. For USD/JPY, the message is straightforward: as long as the Fed keeps policy well above the 3.50% floor and refuses to pre-commit to a rapid easing cycle, rate differentials still favour the dollar side of the pair.\nKevin Warsh risk premium supports USD/JPY beyond the initial Fed reaction\nThe Fed chair race has become a second driver for USD/JPY, and the shift in betting toward Kevin Warsh changes the profile of US policy risk for currency markets. Warsh is not an unknown outsider; he sat at the table as a Fed governor through the 2006\u20132011 crisis period, and he has consistently questioned an over-reliance on a bloated balance sheet and ultra-easy policy. That history makes him the least dovish of the remaining candidates and a clear contrast to names the market had priced as aggressively pro-cut. His emergence at the front of the race has pushed investors to re-assess the \u201cdebasement\u201d trade in the dollar and unwind part of the premium embedded into bearish USD positions. You can see that in USD/JPY price action: after a flush lower earlier in the week, the pair has rebounded through the 154 handle as the prospect of a more orthodox, inflation-focused Fed chair reduces the appeal of leaning short the dollar into political uncertainty.\nHot US producer inflation and curve dynamics keep the dollar bid against the yen\nBeyond personalities, the data backdrop is not friendly to yen bulls. US producer prices firmed, with headline PPI up 0.5% month-on-month after 0.2% previously and running at roughly 3.0% year-on-year, while the core gauge jumped 0.7% on the month and 3.3% on the year, signalling upstream price pressure has not fully relaxed. At the same time, the US 2s10s curve briefly steepened to levels last seen in early 2022 even as outright yields eased after the Warsh headlines, an unusual combination that shows markets are starting to price a different mix of growth and inflation risk rather than a straight-line collapse in rates. For USD/JPY, that matters: a steeper curve and sticky producer inflation argue against an aggressive near-term cutting cycle, particularly when Fed officials are split, with one influential governor still calling for a 25 bp reduction while others urge patience. The net effect is that dollar funding remains expensive relative to yen, and the path to materially lower US yields \u2013 the main fuel for sustained USD/JPY downside \u2013 is not yet open.\nJapanese inflation rollover and weak demand undercut the yen side of USD/JPY\nOn the Japanese side of USD/JPY, the data flow is quietly removing support for further rapid normalisation by the Bank of Japan. Tokyo headline CPI slowed to around 1.5% year-on-year from 2.0% the previous month, core dropped back to roughly 2.0%, and the core-core gauge eased to about 2.4%, all softer than consensus. That is not a deflation shock, but it is enough to cool the argument for back-to-back BoJ hikes"

                "body": "USD/JPY extended its losing streak in a choppy week, with the BoJ, intervention, warnings, and Trump\u2019s Fed Chair nomination fueling market volatility.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s upward revisions to GDP and inflation projections, a hawkish BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, and yen intervention threats sent USD/JPY to a weekly low of 152.092 in the week ending January 30.\nHowever, softer Japanese economic data, sticky US producer prices, and President Trump\u2019s nomination for Fed Chair led to a partial recovery. USD/JPY ended the week down 0.64% at 154.750, below the crucial 155 level.\nLast week\u2019s drop below 155, expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts, and a hawkish BoJ rate path support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, the Bank of Japan, Japanese economic data, and political headlines will influence buying interest in the yen. Key economic indicators include finalized PMI numbers and household spending figures.\nPreliminary manufacturing and service sector PMIs signaled a sharp pickup in economic momentum, supporting a hawkish BoJ policy stance. Upward revisions to the preliminary PMIs would reinforce the BoJ\u2019s positive economic outlook. These factors raised expectations of an H1 2026 rate hike. A more hawkish BoJ rate path would boost yen demand, sending USD/JPY lower.\nMeanwhile, December\u2019s household spending figures will face scrutiny after retail sales unexpectedly fell at the end of 2025. Economists expect household spending to fall 1.3% month-on-month after surging 6.2% in November.\nA larger-than-expected fall in household spending would offset the pickup in service sector consumption, cooling bets on an April BoJ rate hike. For context, private consumption contributes around 55% to Japan\u2019s GDP, while the services sector accounts for roughly 70% of GDP.\nHowever, the BoJ\u2019s concerns over yen weakness driving import prices higher may lead to hawkish rhetoric. Typically, rising import prices fuel inflationary pressures, eroding households\u2019 spending power. Policymakers want to avoid the combination of rising inflation and weakening domestic demand, which would adversely impact the economy and trigger price instability.\nWhile the economic data will be key, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions will give insights into the requirements for a rate hike. The BoJ will release its Summary of Opinions on Monday, February 2.\nIncreased optimism that tariff risks have abated, wage growth will continue to accelerate, and the economy and prices will move in line with projections would support a hawkish policy stance.\nTraders should also consider any references to the Bank of Japan\u2019s neutral rate, neither accommodative nor restrictive. A higher neutral rate (potentially 1.5% \u2013 2%) would indicate multiple BoJ rate hikes and a sharply narrower US-Japan rate differential.\nNarrowing rate differentials would push USD/JPY lower. Importantly, these scenarios could trigger a yen carry trade unwind as seen in mid-2024, exposing USD/JPY to sub-140.\nMeanwhile, traders also need to consider the broader economic picture, not just an isolated drop in consumer spending and January\u2019s softer inflation numbers.\nSteady labor market conditions, improved external demand for Japanese goods, and higher wages would lift consumer sentiment. Rising sentiment would drive spending, bolstering the economy, while fueling demand-driven inflation. These dynamics support a more hawkish BoJ rate path, weighing on USD/JPY.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nJapan\u2019s national election will be another market focal point, as voters go to the polls on February 8. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap election in January, looking to leverage her strong personal approval ratings to gain a firmer footing in the lower house.\nA strong election win would give the Japanese Prime Minister greater "

                "body": "Dollar index advances on renewed confidence in Fed autonomy\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded by 1.02% as market participants found optimistic in the Federal Reserve's potential independence following President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. In addition to political developments, the release of US Producer Price Index (PPI) data exceeded analyst forecasts, driving upward revisions for inflation expectations and bolstering the greenback's recovery.\nThe Dollar Index appreciated by 1.02%, reaching 97.15 points, following the official announcement of Kevin Warsh as the nominee to succeed the current Federal Reserve leadership.\nDecember\u2019s PPI data revealed an acceleration in core producer prices, with headline indicators surpassing consensus estimates.\nWhile the Dollar Index remains within a long-term bearish trend, short-term momentum indicators suggest a strengthening bullish impulse.\nDollar index rises amid positive expectations for Fed independence\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) settled approximately 1.02% higher at 97.15 points, marking a significant recovery after nearly a fortnight of sustained depreciation. This reversal followed President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement on Friday, 30 January 2026, that he intends to nominate former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Chair of the Fed. Market participants interpreted the selection of Warsh\u2014a Wall Street veteran\u2014as a move that could preserve the central bank\u2019s autonomy. Although Warsh has previously voiced support for lower interest rates, analysts view him as a more neutral and institutionalist choice compared to other potential candidates, thereby easing fears of direct political interference in monetary policy.\nSimultaneously, data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics provided further tailwinds for the dollar. The Producer Price Index (PPI) rose by 0.5% in December, keeping the year-on-year level at 3.0%, which was notably higher than the 2.7% anticipated by analysts. More significantly, the core PPI\u2014which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors\u2014accelerated from 3.1% to 3.3%, surpassing the 2.9% forecast. Market observers suggest that the uptick in producer costs may be linked to the recent implementation of tariffs, which are exerting upward pressure on industrial overheads. This persistent inflationary data has reinforced the \"higher-for-longer\" narrative, providing immediate support for the DXY at the market close.\nTechnical analysis of the Dollar Index (DXY)\nFrom a technical perspective, the Dollar Index remains entrenched in a long-term bearish trajectory. However, a granular examination of the current market structure reveals a possible inflection point:\n- Trend Context: Over the medium term, the index continues to exhibit a classic bearish structure of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows.\" The DXY remains positioned below its primary 50, 100, and 200-period Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), confirming the prevailing downward trend. Nevertheless, short-term indicators are currently flagging a loss of momentum in this bearish cycle.\n- Resistance Levels: To the upside, the 98.6-point level represents a formidable technical hurdle, as it converges with the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs alongside a historical ceiling. A decisive breach above this zone would pivot the focus toward the 100-point psychological barrier. A sustained move above 100 would signal a major structural shift toward a higher trading range.\n- Support Levels: On the downside, immediate support is identified at 96.5 points. If this floor is invalidated, the next structural target is 95.3, which aligns with the lower boundary of the medium-term descending channel. A breach of the 95.3 level would likely precipitate a deeper market correction.\n- Momentum and Volume: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is exhibiting a bullish divergence that has been developing for approximately nine months, indicating that downside momentum is waning .

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2026 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls to $104\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows bearish momentum as price falls to $104.\n- The altcoin lost 11.52% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $100.\nAs of January 31, the Solana price analysis reveals continued bearish momentum as price falls to $104.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $104\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline has continued into 2026 with the price falling below the $110 mark this week. Moreover, after failing to climb past $128 the price was headed down below $100 but finds support at the $100 level that has enabled recovery back to the $104 level where it faces resistance.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $152.43. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $104.08.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the oversold area and trades close to the edge of the neutral level. The indicator\u2019s value has increased to index 27.38, and its downward curve suggests a bearish pressure at the level. If buying activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bearish activity as the price crashes below the $110 mark. The altcoin\u2019s price declined below $100 but quickly rose to the current $104 mark\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $128.87, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $104.14, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 20.25, the RSI curve is pointing lower, suggesting bearish market sentiment at the level. The level of the index suggests little to no room for further movement in either direction across the short-term. We can expect further increase if buying activities persist for a few consecutive candles.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to e"

This makes it easy for investors of all kinds to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of purchasing Bitcoin directly and storing it in a crypto wallet.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF charges a 0.21% management fee, which is the only fee charged when purchasing the ETF. Should you buy, sell, or hold the ETF in 2026?\nA unique diversifier\nGiven that the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF tracks the price of Bitcoin, the question really boils down to whether one should buy, hold, or sell Bitcoin. A main reason to hold the token is that it can provide unique diversification in one's portfolio. Bitcoin's finite 21 million tokens that will ever be mined, position the token as a potential form of digital gold.\nWhile Bitcoin at times trades like a high-beta tech stock, it has also tracked the movements of gold and other precious metals. Gold has surged in recent years due to geopolitical concerns and mounting U.S. government debt, which has raised concerns among investors, particularly in the bond market, about the U.S. government's financial situation and how sustainable it is.\nThe U.S. government now has a fiscal deficit of nearly $1.8 trillion and total debt of over $38 trillion. Each year, the government allocates a significant portion of the fiscal budget to interest payments on the debt.\nA cohort of economists and market strategists believes that, over time, this will contribute to U.S. dollar debasement, particularly if the government implements policies to boost growth, which could lead to higher or more prolonged inflation. This is the main case for gold, and it's an investment theory that has worked incredibly well in recent years.\nAdvertisement\nThere's still widespread dispute over whether Bitcoin is a form of digital gold. While I can't be certain, I think Bitcoin's ascent is telling that there is at least a good chance of Bitcoin being a form of digital gold, and therefore a unique diversifier in one's portfolio. For this reason, I think it's a good idea to at least have some Bitcoin in your portfolio.\nThe fact that over 95% of tokens have now been mined and are in circulation also sets up a strong supply-and-demand dynamic for Bitcoin.\nShould you buy stock in Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

His deregulatory platform was expected to be a boon for stocks in the financials sector as well as the crypto industry.\nBut things did not go quite as planned. In 2025, financials ranked second-to-last among the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors with a gain of just over 5%. Crypto enthusiasts were even more disappointed.\nAfter hitting its then-all-time-high on Jan. 25 (five days after Trump took office for the start of his second term), Bitcoin (BTC) has lost nearly 15%, including a more than 27% loss since its current record high on Oct. 4, 2025.\nThat pain wasn\u2019t isolated to the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi. With the advent of crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the equity markets have suffered as well, despite massive inflows into the funds providing exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH).\nAs the familiar disclaimer goes, past performance is not indicative of future results. As shareholders of spot Bitcoin ETFs wait for the next potential leg up, they should reconsider two funds whose expense ratios do not justify their performance, while keeping an eye on one with a very inviting expense ratio.\nDespite Breaking Ground, Grayscale Is Eroding Shareholder Returns\nAccording to blockchain data analytics firm TRM, Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw nearly $10 billion in inflows in 2025. But that surging demand wouldn\u2019t have been made possible without the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of the first 11 spot Bitcoin ETPs on Jan. 10, 2024.\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF Today\nGBTCGrayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF\n$65.37 -0.16 (-0.24%) As of 01/30/2026 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $59.79\n\u25bc\n$99.12 - Assets Under Management\n- $20.41 billion\nThat landmark decision paved the way for funds\u2014like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF NYSEARCA: GBTC\u2014to start offering indirect exposure to crypto markets by tracking the daily spot price of Bitcoin.\nIn doing so, investors who are uncomfortable with the DeFi landscape or simply looking for more convenient access have flocked to these ETFs. The GBTC, for instance, has attracted more than $20 billion in assets under management (AUM) with a highly liquid average daily trading volume of just more than 4 million shares.\nMirroring Bitcoin prices, the fund has stumbled of late, having posted a loss of more than 29% since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 6, 2025.\nThe ETF has an expense ratio of 1.5%, significantly higher than the average passively managed ETF\u2019s expense ratio. Even worse, the fund, which is not actively managed, costs more than the average actively managed ETF. For context, Vanguard charges an average of 0.05% for its ETFs.\nProShares Offers Superior Liquidity, But Elevated Expense Ratios\nDespite a notably lower AUM of $2.45 billion, at nearly 60 million shares, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITO offers higher average daily trading volume compared to the GBTC\u2019s already strong liquidity.\nProShares Bitcoin ETF Today\nBITOProShares Bitcoin ETF\n$11.60 -0.06 (-0.51%) As of 01/30/2026 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $11.33\n\u25bc\n$25.75 - Dividend Yield\n- 82.07%\n- Assets Under Management\n- $2.40 billion\nThe fund, which is actively managed, differentiates itself with a long Bitcoin, short U.S. dollar futures strategy.\nBut its active management has not helped it produce attractive returns. Over the past year, the fund has fallen nearly 50%.\nLike the GBTC, the BITO carries a higher-than-usual expense ratio. While those charges account for everything from administrative and compliance fees to management and marketing fees, the industry average for an actively managed ETF is substantially lower.\nAccording to Morningstar Direct, the average expense ratio for actively managed ETFs is 0.44%. ProShares, on the other hand, charges 0.95% for its Bitcoin ETF.\nCurrent short interest of 17.42% suggests that shareholders could see more downside risk in the near term.\niShares Is the "

                "body": "DeFi has entered an institutional phase, with large investors gradually testing the waters in crypto ETFs and digital asset treasuries. The shift signals the maturation of on-chain finance, introducing new instruments and digital counterparts to traditional assets. Yet as flows rise, so do questions about risk management and the resilience of underlying infrastructure. For institutions to participate with confidence, the ecosystem must harden its guardrails, standardize risk disclosures, and ensure liquidity access remains predictable even under stress. The broad arc is clear: move beyond yield chasing toward a structured, auditable framework that aligns DeFi with the expectations of regulated finance.\nKey takeaways\n- Institutional participation in crypto is expanding beyond spot exposure to regulated products and digital asset treasuries, expanding on-chain liquidity and demand for governance-grade infrastructure.\n- Three primary risk areas are highlighted: protocol risk driven by DeFi\u2019s composability, reflexivity risk from leveraged staking and looping strategies, and duration risk tied to liquidity timelines and solver incentives.\n- Trust is the scarce resource in the next phase of DeFi, with standardized guardrails and interoperable risk reporting viewed as prerequisites for a true institutional supercycle.\n- Stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets are reshaping on-chain fundamentals, driving institutional demand and signaling Ethereum\u2019s prominence as a settlement layer.\n- Industry signals point to a need for shared risk-management frameworks similar to those in TradFi, including clearinghouse-like structures and standardized disclosures for DeFi protocols.\nSentiment: Neutral\nMarket context: The ascent of regulated ETFs and on-chain treasuries sits within a broader push toward more liquid, transparent, and auditable crypto markets. As institutional flows grow, liquidity conditions and risk governance will increasingly shape which DeFi primitives scale and which remain niche experiments.\nWhy it matters\nThe current rise of regulated institutional products has done more than inflate on-chain TVLs; it has moved the dialogue from \u201chow much yield can be generated\u201d to \u201chow can risk be measured, disclosed, and managed at scale.\u201d A Paradigm-backed view suggests risk management is treated as an operational pillar rather than a compliance checkbox, underscoring the need for formalized standards as DeFi seeks to attract larger, more durable capital footprints. The near-term implication is a shift in emphasis from rapid experimentation to rigorous governance, with industry-wide norms around disclosure and interoperability acting as the backbone for broader adoption.\nWithin this frame, the industry has begun to witness a practical convergence around three pillars: the maturation of stablecoins as a payment and settlement tool, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), and the tokenization of traditional instruments such as government securities. The stability and scalability of stablecoins have become critical to supporting multi-chain liquidity and cross-border settlement, while RWAs enable the on-chain replication of largely traditional asset classes. In parallel, large institutions are piloting tokenized treasuries and stock-market access through on-chain equivalents, hinting at a future where a wider class of financial products can live on Ethereum and related networks. The net effect is a more connected, on-chain financial system that retains the risk sensitivities familiar to regulated markets.\nIn the institutional ETF arena, the appetite has produced notable landmarks. The framing of regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products has produced flows that some observers describe as a bellwether for broader acceptance. Specifically, two of the most successful ETF launches in the last two years\u2014BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum ETF (CRYPTO: ETH)\u2014illustrate a growing willingness among asset ma"

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in full drama mode again. The chart is swinging, gas fees are flaring up during peak activity, and traders are split between calling for a massive continuation and warning about a brutal bull trap that could leave late buyers rekt. Instead of obsessing over tick-by-tick moves, you need to understand what is actually happening under the hood: Layer-2 expansion, regulatory heat, ETF hopes, and a changing macro backdrop. That is where the real edge is.\nRight now, ETH is doing what it always does in transition phases: faking people out, shaking out weak hands, and testing conviction. Dominance is being challenged by newer chains, but the core thesis for Ethereum as the settlement layer for Web3, DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 ecosystems is still firmly alive. The volatility you are seeing is not random noise; it is the market trying to reprice what Ethereum means in a world of scaling solutions, real-world asset tokenization, and on-chain liquidity battles.\nThe Narrative: According to the latest Ethereum coverage and commentary from outlets like CoinDesk, several key storylines are driving sentiment:\n1. Layer-2 Explosion:\nArbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, Scroll, Starknet \u2013 Layer-2s are no longer side characters, they are core to Ethereum\u2019s future. Activity is increasingly flowing to these networks as users hunt for lower gas fees and faster confirmations. This is a double-edged sword: on one side, it proves Ethereum\u2019s modular thesis is working; on the other, it makes some traders wonder if value will leak away from ETH toward L2 tokens.\nThe deeper truth is that most of these Layer-2s settle back to Ethereum. That means more transactions, more burn, more demand for ETH as the asset that ultimately secures the system. The narrative is shifting from \u201cETH is too slow and expensive\u201d to \u201cETH is the base layer for a multichain, rollup-centric future.\u201d If that narrative sticks, long-term demand for ETH as collateral and as a settlement asset can still ramp hard.\n2. Regulatory and ETF Drama:\nIn the background, there is constant regulatory noise: is ETH a commodity, a security, or something in between. Speculation about Ethereum-based ETF products, both spot and derivatives, keeps coming and going in waves. Every time there is a hint of progress, traders rush in with renewed optimism; every time there is a delay or mixed signal from regulators, fear spikes about a potential crackdown.\nCoinDesk coverage has repeatedly highlighted how ETH sits right in the crosshairs of regulators and institutions: programmable money, staking yields, DeFi leverage, tokenized everything. That makes ETH uniquely powerful but also uniquely exposed. If regulators lean constructive, the door opens for institutional flows into ETH products. If they lean hostile, it could push activity offshore and inject serious headline risk into the price action.\n3. Vitalik, Dev Roadmap, and the Credible Neutrality Angle:\nVitalik and the Ethereum core devs are still laser-focused on scaling, security, and decentralization. The roadmap \u2013 danksharding, proto-danksharding, rollup-centric scaling, stateless clients \u2013 reads like a multi-year plan to turn Ethereum into a hyper-efficient global settlement engine.\nThis is critical for the \u201cflippening\u201d narrative: the long-standing idea that Ethereum could one day overtake Bitcoin in overall market value. For flippening believers, the argument is simple: Bitcoin is pristine collateral and digital gold; Ethereum is digital gold plus a world computer, settlement layer, and base yield engine for DeFi. For skeptics, the counter-argument is that Ethereum\u2019s complexity is a risk, and competing smart contract chains are not going away quietly.\n4.

                "body": "On January 30, Lighter announced a collaboration with Axiom to build Lighter EVM, an Ethereum-compatible rollup. The platform will enable developers to create general-purpose apps that use Lighter\u2019s advantages and detect market liquidity with ZK-verified security.\nAccording to Lighter, the system will function as the current Lighter custom circuit system without any changes, enabling the platform to add additional customizable capabilities while retaining its high-performance trade verification.\nAxiom, on the other hand, revealed that OpenVM 2.0, which offers real-time performance and proven soundness, will be used to verify the Lighter EVM and help consumers achieve lower costs without sacrificing security. The verification will enable the Lighter EVM to offer real-time performance and provable soundness, enabling users to pay low costs without compromising security.\nLighter EVM enables fast, composable DeFi trading ecosystem\n\u2014 Lighter (@Lighter_xyz) January 30, 2026\nAxiom explained that the Lighter EVM provides a smart contract environment compatible with the optimized Lighter system. Recursive aggregation of Lighter proofs will be enabled via custom OpenVM additions tailored to the Plonky2 proof system, allowing combined zero-knowledge verification of Lighter EVM and Lighter state transitions.\nAccording to Axiom, the system would provide real-time verification on the Ethereum mainnet by utilizing the high-performance SWIRL proof method. Axiom further claimed that this strategy aims to give customers native composability with perps and spot trading on the Lighter platform while offering low-cost, high-throughput EVM execution.\nHowever, these verification and execution features will enable interoperability between Lighter EVM and the core Lighter markets.\nLighter outlined that the system will enable fast interoperability with its markets by jointly settling with Lighter on the Ethereum mainnet. Users will be able to transfer assets, place orders, and manage Lighter positions from Lighter EVM.\nCrucially, users can switch between execution environments in a matter of seconds without waiting for L1 finality. At launch, Lighter stated that the system will offer rapid async reads of tasks such as staking, order placement, and asset transfers.\n\u201cWe are actively researching methods to reduce write latency and potentially offer a synchronous option,\u201d the company wrote on X.\nThe company also said that the system will enable an ecosystem of Lighter-colocated EVM applications that may leverage the power of the Ethereum DeFi community.\nAccording to the trading platform, Lighter EVM would provide stablecoins created natively on the platform, quick deposit bridges, and collateral sharing between lending on the system and perps on Lighter. The system would also enable new applications, such as tokenization.\nAxiom expands fiat-to-crypto access through strategic partnerships\nAxiom and Lighter collaboration to launch Lighter EVM follows a string of recent initiatives from Axiom, including a partnership with Onramper to simplify crypto on- and off-ramps for DeFi users worldwide.\nOn December 4 of last year, Onramper announced a partnership with Axiom to provide one of DeFi\u2019s quickest and smoothest trading experiences. Under the partnership, Axiom customers would gain instant top-ups in BNB and SOL using over 130 payment methods, including debit and credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, and localized options in 190 countries.\n\u201cOur job is to simplify the way users move from fiat into crypto. By offering a wide range of trusted, localized payment options, we ensure that users can onboard quickly and compliantly. We\u2019re thrilled to support Axiom as they scale the next generation of DeFi on Solana.\u201d\n-Thijs Maas, CEO of Onramper.\nAxiom\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Henry Zhang, also commented regarding the partnership. He stated that the company is providing a quick, international, and user-friendly on-chain trading experience. He also noted that integrat"

                "body": "Key takeaways\n- Solana\u2019s price can reach a maximum of $166.94 with an average trading value of $155.83 in 2026.\n- By 2029, SOL is expected to reach a high of $263.38, supported by continued ecosystem growth and network adoption.\n- Solana\u2019s price could see further upside by 2032, potentially reaching $397.47 with an average trading price around $365.19.\nDespite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape.\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform\u2019s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem.\nWhile uncertainties persist, Solana\u2019s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2026 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls to $104\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows bearish momentum as price falls to $104.\n- The altcoin lost 11.52% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $100.\nAs of January 31, the Solana price analysis reveals continued bearish momentum as price falls to $104.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $104\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline has continued into 2026 with the price falling below the $110 mark this week. Moreover, after failing to climb past $128 the price was headed down below $100 but finds support at the $100 level that has enabled recovery back to the $104 level where it faces resistance.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $152.43. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $104.08.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the oversold area and trades close to the edge of the neutral level. The indicator\u2019s value has increased to index 27.38, and its downward curve suggests a bearish pressure at the level. If buying activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bearish activity as the price crashes below the $110 mark. The altcoin\u2019s price declined below $100 but quickly rose to the current $104 mark\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $128.87, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $104.14, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 20.25, the RSI curve is pointing lower, suggesting bearish market sentiment at the level. The level of the index suggests little to no room for further movement in either direction across the short-term. We can expect further increase if buying activities persist for a few consecutive candles.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to e"

Investors are reviewing the likely impact of a shift in Fed leadership on monetary policy, which directly affects banks and industrial companies.\nS&P 500: Mixed Earnings and Sector Rotation\nThe S&P 500 declined 0.52%. The drop was driven by sector rotation, with materials, communication services, and technology stocks acting as the main drags. Mixed corporate earnings reports contributed to the lack of a clear market direction.\nNasdaq: Tech Stumbles on Hawkish Fed Sentiment\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell 0.66%. The nomination of a perceived hawkish candidate for Fed chair strengthened the U.S. dollar and cooled investor appetite for high-growth technology stocks, as the sector is sensitive to future interest rate expectations.\nNYSE: Broad Market Weakness Evident\nThe NYSE Composite fell 1.11%, lagging behind other major indices. The sharper decline indicates that Friday\u2019s selling was broad-based, pointing to a general \u201crisk-off\u201d mood among investors.\nDid the Gold and Silver Crash Impact Stocks?\nYes, but indirectly. The steep fall in gold and silver prices was not the direct cause of the equity sell-off. Instead, both markets reacted to the same root cause: expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy under a new Fed chair.\nA stronger U.S. dollar, supported by these expectations, led investors to book profits in equities and precious metals. The effect was most visible in mining stocks, as shares of leading gold producer Newmont Corp. fell more than 6.6%."

When a stock gets dropped, these funds often sell off their shares, sparking sharp price swings and heavy trading, even without any fresh earnings updates.\nFTSE Russell announced on Jan. 28 that Ashtead shares will convert one-for-one into shares of Sunbelt Rental Holdings, a newly formed U.S. parent company. The last day to trade Ashtead shares is expected to be Feb. 27. Pending court approval, Ashtead will be removed from the FTSE UK Index Series when markets open on March 2.\nAshtead ended Friday at 4,687 pence, slipping 0.8% following a 7.6% drop on Thursday, per Investing.com data. Trading volumes ran above average over both days. (Investing)\nThe company added to its buyback activity, purchasing 73,921 shares for treasury on Jan. 28 at an average price of 5,087.635 pence each. This move is part of its share repurchase program capped at $1.5 billion. (Investegate)\nIn its half-year statement last December, CEO Brendan Horgan revealed a new $1.5bn share buyback program set to start on 2 March 2026, aligning with the planned NYSE re-listing, which remains on schedule. The company also highlighted an investor day scheduled for March in New York City. (Ashtead Group)\nAshtead, known in North America as Sunbelt Rentals, has framed its U.S. listing as a move aligning more closely with the bulk of its operations. Reuters has identified the company as the second-largest equipment rental firm in the U.S. (Reuters)\nTraders will keep an eye on index-related positioning heading into the end of February and early March. They\u2019ll also look for updates on the court-led process timeline. The \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d refers to a court-supervised restructuring method used in the UK to alter a company\u2019s holding structure.\nThe calendar isn\u2019t set in stone. FTSE Russell noted that its planned index changes hinge on court approval; any hold-up could push back the deletion schedule and affect related trading. Meanwhile, Ashtead\u2019s core rental demand still depends on U.S. construction and project activity.\nThe next key dates are Feb. 27, marking Ashtead\u2019s final trading day under the current schedule, and March 2, when FTSE Russell plans to drop the stock from the FTSE UK Index Series. On that same day, the new holding company\u2019s shares are set to return to London trading alongside their New York listing."

After a period of sideways chop and hesitation, the index has shifted into a dynamic upward phase, with buyers pushing prices closer to the upper region of the long-term range. The move is not a meme rally \u2013 it is driven by real flows rotating into European blue chips, but it is far from risk-free. Under the surface, you still have shaky German manufacturing, a cautious ECB, and a global environment where one bad macro print can flip the script from euphoria to panic.\nThe current DAX structure screams \"inflection point\": the index is grinding near a major resistance zone that previously triggered sharp profit taking. Short-term traders are eyeing a potential breakout scenario, while longer-term investors are quietly asking whether this strength is sustainable or just another bear trap in disguise. Volatility is not extreme, but intraday swings are big enough to punish late chasers. If you are buying here, you are betting that European risk assets can shrug off growth fears and that German exporters can ride a global recovery instead of sinking under weak demand and tight financing conditions.\nThe Story: To understand today\u2019s DAX mood, you need to look at three power centers: the ECB, German macro data, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 The Lagarde Factor\nThe European Central Bank remains the main puppet master for every DAX move. Markets are stuck in a push-pull dynamic: on one side, traders are hoping for a more dovish tone as inflation gradually cools; on the other side, policymakers are terrified of declaring victory too early and then seeing another price spike. That tension is exactly what fuels the nervous optimism in European equities.\nWhen the ECB signals patience, the DAX often reacts with brief hesitation: banks like higher yields, but heavily indebted sectors and high-multiple growth names feel the squeeze. When the tone shifts even slightly toward future cuts, you can literally see a wave of risk-on money flowing into German and European indices. Right now, the bias is cautiously supportive for equities: inflation has lost some of its panic factor, but growth is too weak to justify aggressive tightening. That gives the DAX a window of opportunity \u2013 as long as no new inflation shock or geopolitical shock ruins the party.\n2. German Economy \u2013 Industrial Giant With Clay Feet\nGermany is still the industrial engine of Europe, but that engine has been misfiring. Manufacturing and factory orders have swung between fragile stabilization and renewed weakness. Energy costs are no longer at peak-crisis levels, yet they remain structurally higher than pre-crisis, which keeps pressure on chemical producers, heavy industry, and energy-intensive business models.\nThe auto sector \u2013 think global brands in the DAX ecosystem \u2013 is going through a brutal transformation. Electric vehicles, Chinese competition, and tighter climate rules mean old profit formulas are broken. Markets are rewarding those players that show credible restructuring and solid margins in EVs and software, while punishing the laggards. This divergence inside the DAX is massive: some industrial and tech-oriented names are attracting fresh global capital, while more cyclical and old-economy names trade like value traps, bouncing but not convincingly breaking out.\nOn top of that, recession chatter has not fully disappeared. Growth data oscillate between weak and slightly less weak, not between strong and stronger. That is why every new PMI, Ifo survey, or GDP update matters."

Instead of a clean melt-up or a brutal selloff, we are seeing a tense stand-off between buyers and sellers. The index is hovering around important zones where every small headline on rates, growth, or geopolitics can flip the direction. German blue chips are neither in full panic nor full euphoria \u2013 it feels like a coiled spring.\nVolatility is not extreme, but it is clearly elevated compared to the sleepy phases we saw during past easy-money cycles. Intraday moves are getting punchier. Gaps are more common. And traders who fall asleep on risk management can get stopped out fast. This is the kind of environment where disciplined traders can shine, and overconfident gamblers can get wiped.\nThe Story: To understand what is really driving the DAX 40 right now, you need to zoom out from the candles and look at the macro battlefield: the ECB, the euro, energy, and German industrial momentum.\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 The Boss of European Risk-On/Risk-Off\nThe European Central Bank sits at the center of the DAX narrative. After an aggressive tightening cycle to fight inflation, the ECB is now stuck in the classic dilemma: inflation has cooled from the peak, but growth is fragile, especially in Germany. Markets are constantly gaming the timing and pace of future rate cuts.\nWhenever traders sense that the ECB might lean slightly more dovish \u2013 hinting at easier financial conditions ahead \u2013 you see German equities catch a bid. Growth-sensitive sectors like industrials, autos, and tech-related names tend to lead those green moves. On the other side, any tough ECB talk about staying restrictive for longer hits the DAX as investors price in slower profits, higher financing costs, and weaker risk appetite.\nThe current tone from policymakers is cautious. They cannot declare victory on inflation, but they also know the euro area economy is not exactly booming. That ambiguity is why the DAX is in this choppy, tactical environment rather than a clean macro trend.\n2. German Economy \u2013 From \u201cExport Machine\u201d to Question Mark\nGermany used to be the unshakable export engine of Europe. Today, the story is far more complicated. Manufacturing data has been under pressure in recent quarters, with weak order books, especially from key global customers. PMI readings and industrial production numbers repeatedly signal that the old model is under stress.\nThe German auto sector \u2013 think big names in cars, suppliers, and mobility \u2013 is at the epicenter of this transition. Electric vehicles, Chinese competition, software, and regulatory shifts all hit at once. When global risk sentiment is optimistic, investors treat these names as deep-value cyclical plays. When recession fears flare up, they turn into dead weight that drags the DAX lower.\nAt the same time, there are pockets of resilience: industrial automation, specialty chemicals, defense-related suppliers, and companies tied to digital infrastructure. The DAX, as a mix of old-world exporters and global champions, becomes a pure barometer of whether investors believe in a German adaptation story or a slow structural decline.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar \u2013 The FX Tide Behind Every DAX Wave\nNo serious DAX analysis ignores the EUR/USD pair. A softer euro tends to be a tailwind for export-heavy German names because their international revenues translate more profitably back into euros. A stronger euro, especially if driven by relatively tighter ECB policy compared with the Fed, can act like a headwind.\nRight now, the currency market is balancing expectations between "

After a determined upward move, German blue chips are trading in an elevated zone, attracting both aggressive bulls and highly suspicious bears. Price action has shifted from sleepy sideways chop to a more dynamic, momentum-driven phase. Buyers have been defending pullbacks with confidence, but every new push higher attracts profit-taking and short-sellers looking for the next reversal.\nThink of the current DAX mood as cautious optimism with a hard risk-off trigger finger. The index is no longer in panic mode, yet it is also far from euphoric melt-up territory. Volatility is moderate, dips are being bought, but nobody is ignoring macro headlines anymore. One unexpected shock on rates, energy, or geopolitics and sentiment can flip from hopeful to fearful very quickly.\nThe Story: What is driving this latest DAX move? It is a cocktail of central bank expectations, euro dynamics, energy relief, and slowly healing German industry.\n1. ECB and the Rate Game\nThe European Central Bank sits right at the center of the current DAX narrative. Markets are constantly gaming out when and how strongly the ECB will start cutting rates after its aggressive hiking cycle. On the one hand, inflation pressures have eased from their peak, especially with energy prices no longer exploding higher. On the other hand, core inflation and wage dynamics are still too sticky for the ECB to declare victory.\nFor the DAX, this creates a push-pull effect. Rate cut hopes act as a tailwind for growth and tech-heavy sectors, while any hawkish commentary from ECB officials quickly cools the party. Traders are laser-focused on every ECB press conference, every hint from policymakers, and every inflation print. The narrative going around European desks is that the ECB wants to keep optionality: talk tough to keep inflation expectations anchored, but be ready to pivot if growth data deteriorates sharply.\n2. German Macro: From Recession Talk to Fragile Stabilization\nGermany has been the classic \"sick man of Europe\" headline for months: weak manufacturing, soft exports, and persistent fears of a technical recession. Lately though, the tone has shifted from pure doom to a more nuanced picture of fragile stabilization.\nIndustrial output data has stopped free-falling and is instead oscillating in a choppy, bottoming pattern. Order books, particularly in machinery and chemicals, are no longer collapsing but remain far from booming. The auto sector \u2013 with giants like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 is navigating the brutal EV transition while facing aggressive pricing from Chinese competitors. Every new sales update or guidance tweak from these names can trigger quick rotations inside the index.\nFor DAX traders, the question is simple: is Germany building a base for a new industrial upswing, or is this just a pause before the next wave of weakness? This uncertainty is precisely why rallies still feel nervous, not euphoric.\n3. Euro vs Dollar: FX as a Hidden Lever\nThe euro versus the dollar is another huge variable. A stronger euro typically hurts export-heavy German champions because their goods become more expensive globally, while a weaker euro boosts their competitiveness and foreign earnings when translated back into euros.\nRight now, the euro has been trading in a broadly stable but headline-sensitive zone. Any sign that the Federal Reserve might cut faster than the ECB can push the dollar lower and the euro higher, and that tends to cap enthusiasm for the DAX\u2019s export names. Conversely, if US data stay"

                "body": "Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:WASH) Reported Earnings Last Week And Analysts Are Already Upgrading Their Estimates\nIt's been a pretty great week for Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:WASH) shareholders, with its shares surging 14% to US$34.37 in the week since its latest full-year results. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$220m were in line with what the analysts predicted, Washington Trust Bancorp surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$2.71 per share, modestly greater than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Washington Trust Bancorp from three analysts is for revenues of US$247.4m in 2026. If met, it would imply a notable 13% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 25% to US$3.43. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$232.8m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.19 in 2026. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in sentiment following the latest results, given the upgrades to both revenue and earnings per share forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for Washington Trust Bancorp\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 10% to US$34.25per share. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Washington Trust Bancorp, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$40.00 and the most bearish at US$31.00 per share. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. For example, we noticed that Washington Trust Bancorp's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 13% growth to the end of 2026 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 11% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 8.8% annually. So it looks like Washington Trust Bancorp is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while."

                "body": "While Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:NSSC) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 16% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 179% the gain in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now.\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Napco Security Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 43% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Napco Security Technologies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Napco Security Technologies the TSR over the last 5 years was 189%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nA Different Perspective\nNapco Security Technologies shareholders are up 2.2% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 24% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Three women, all with babies in their arms, find seats at a second common table in the backyard garden, joining others who\u2019ve disappeared into laptop-headphones concentration mode.\nA guy with a complicated-looking video camera pans the crowd while maneuvering around the furniture. He\u2019s in media, too, and we\u2019re here for the same reason.\nWhat makes this coffee destination unique\nSydney Wayser and her husband, Isaac Watters, opened Granada in early January. They run it out of the ground-floor section of their house. Their business has become the first breakout sensation in central Los Angeles that\u2019s part of the Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation (MEHKO) program, introduced as a California Health and Safety Code statute in 2019, designed to legally permit enterprising cooks who want to make food to sell from home, or to create a micro-restaurant in their residence.\nThe state mandate left it to individual counties to approve MEHKO operations, which the L.A. County Board of Supervisors passed in May 2024. Applicants began receiving permits in November 2024, after a process that involved steps any local restaurant would go through, including food safety certification, business licensing and inspection via the L.A. County Department of Public Health.\nWatters and Wayser brainstormed the idea for Granada after Watters heard a segment on KCRW, during which L.A. journalist Meghan McCarron was discussing an article about the MEHKO initiative she had written for the New York Times.\nThe couple had in essence already constructed a possibility for such a space, and as individuals they were built for it.\nThey\u2019d designed their house, a tasteful modern cube at the top of a cul-de-sac among the 19th century Victorian and California Craftsman homes of Angelino Heights, for post-pandemic entertaining. They have a 3-year-old daughter. Something like a coffee shop, they thought, would be ideal to operate roughly during the hours she was in preschool Monday through Friday.\nA short menu came together: classic espresso drinks, cold brew, loose leaf tea and the requisite matcha latte, alongside a few pastries (seasonally shifting galettes, both sweet and savory, square biscuits with visible layers and a delicately crumbed ricotta-blood orange cake) from star L.A. baker Sasha Piligian. Ceramicist Amy Louise Johnson crafted beautiful earthen cups.\nI\u2019m guessing neither Watters nor Wayser anticipated quite the instant burst of social-media-driven popularity, but they\u2019re also both musicians. I watched them both navigate customer interactions with unflagging charisma. When a woman complimented the vase of flowers on the kitchen island that serves as an ordering counter, Wayser waved her hand breezily and said, \u201cThey\u2019re a week and a half old now and starting to wilt. I haven\u2019t had the time to change them!\u201d\nComing and going, I noticed patrons acting respectfully with regard to neighbors. No one unthinkingly parked in the long, steep driveway that serves multiple properties; the area has plenty of street parking. A fence around Granada dampens the sound. You won\u2019t know the place exists until you pass through the entrance to find a yard full of souls attending what feels like an unusually mellow house party.\nBigger MEHKO implications and possibilities\nIt is thrilling to witn"
