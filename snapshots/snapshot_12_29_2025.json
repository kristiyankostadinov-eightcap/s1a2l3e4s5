                "body": "BRICS \u2014 a significant economic bloc of emerging nations comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2014 is fast shifting its reliance on the US Dollar to gold through the accumulation of the precious metal. Although officially BRICS nations hold around 20% of the global gold reserves, they, along with their strategically allied states (who are not BRICS members but have strong ties with BRICS member countries), now collectively hold around 50% of the global gold production.\nRussia and China are leading from the front in this strategy. In 2024, China produced 380 tonnes of gold, while Russia contributed 340 tonnes. Following this strategy, in September 2025, Brazil purchased 16 tonnes of gold, marking its first gold purchase since 2021.\nExplaining the dual strategy of BRICS member countries, Anuj Gupta, Director at Ya Wealth, said, \u201cBRICS member countries are both producing more gold and selling less. At the same time, they are also purchasing gold from the international market. According to existing data, between 2020 and 2024, the Central Banks of the respective BRICS nations purchased more than 50% of the global gold, information that US President Donald Trump may not like to hear.\u201d\nDecoding this BRICS dual strategy on gold, Sachin Jasuja, Head of Equities and Founding Partner, Centricity WealthTech, said, \"The increasing control of gold reserves and gold purchases by BRICS nations is emerging as a meaningful signal of stress within the US Dollar-dominated global financial order. While the US Dollar remains the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, recent developments suggest that its uncontested supremacy is being gradually questioned rather than abruptly challenged.\"\nToday, BRICS economies account for nearly 30% of global trade, giving their collective monetary choices global relevance. A long-standing objective of the bloc has been to reduce its reliance on Western financial infrastructure, particularly the US dollar, for trade settlement and reserve purposes.\nHighlighting the developments that led to the germination of this shift in BRICS member nations' thinking, Jasuja added, \"The decisive shift in thinking followed the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, when Western governments froze a substantial portion of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. This episode fundamentally altered how sovereign nations perceive reserve safety. It demonstrated that reserves held in dollar-denominated assets or foreign jurisdictions are exposed to geopolitical risk if political alignment breaks down. Since then, reserve management has increasingly prioritised assets that are politically neutral, physically held, and immune to external control.\"\nSachin Jasuja said that BRICS central banks have been among the most aggressive buyers, with China, Russia, and India now ranking among the world\u2019s largest official gold holders. As a result, gold\u2019s share in BRICS foreign exchange reserves has steadily increased, while exposure to dollar assets has moderated at the margin. This reserve shift has coincided with a sharp and sustained rally in gold prices, reflecting not only inflation hedging but also strong official demand. The price action suggests markets are increasingly recognising gold\u2019s renewed role as the ultimate reserve asset in a fragmented financial system\u2014one where trust in reserve currencies is no longer unconditional.\n\"BRICS nations have been actively reducing dollar dependence in trade. Over the past decade, the share of intra-BRICS trade settled in local currencies has risen steadily, with roughly one-third of such trade now bypassing the dollar. Bilateral arrangements\u2014such as India\u2013Russia and China\u2013Brazil trade in local currencies\u2014illustrate a pragmatic shift aimed at lowering transaction costs, reducing exposure to sanctions, and limiting dependence on dollar liquidity cycles,\" said Jasuja.\nAsked about the outcome of this dual strategy on gold adopted by BRICS members and their allied states, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, \"BRICS in"

                "body": "Iran FX Today, December 28: Euro Jumps Above 169k as Rial Slides\nEuro price in Iran surged above 169,000 toman on December 28 as the rial fell further and the dollar hovered near 144,000. For investors in Germany, this fast move matters because it can lift safe-haven demand, sway EM risk, and filter into energy sentiment. Record gold coin prices and merchant protests in Tehran show stress from inflation and scarce FX. We explain what the moves signal, why they matter for European portfolios, and the practical checks to make today.\nFX spike on December 28\nIran\u2019s parallel market saw the euro quoted above 169,000 toman and the dollar around 144,000 on December 28. Local coverage flagged earlier breaks above 137,000 for the dollar as momentum built in the day\u2019s trade source. Thin liquidity, FX scarcity, and policy doubts likely amplified the move. The jump puts focus on spreads between official and market rates, a key stress gauge for payment chains and pricing.\nReports of merchant protests in Tehran\u2019s bazaars highlight how fast price swings disrupt trade and inventory planning. The central bank\u2019s intervention path is unclear, which keeps risk premia elevated and fuels defensive positioning. For Germany-based investors, the day\u2019s action flags possible shifts in EM flows and oil-linked sentiment if currency losses deepen or extend into the week.\nGold and inflation signals\nLocal data point to gold coins jumping to about 164,000,000 toman, a fresh record that mirrors the currency slide and inflation anxiety source. In cash-constrained markets, households often rotate into coins and jewelry when the domestic unit weakens. This move usually widens the premium over international bullion, reflecting both FX pressure and strong local demand for portable stores of value.\nThe spike in coins signals firm inflation expectations alongside tight FX supply. If the Euro price in Iran keeps rising, local prices for imported goods can adjust quickly, reinforcing demand for gold. In Europe, that pattern often coincides with interest in EUR gold exposure and quality credit, while EM credit spreads can drift wider as investors reduce risk until policy direction becomes clearer.\nWhy this matters for Germany\nGerman exporters with legacy Iran exposure face higher payment slippage when the Iran dollar rate and Euro price in Iran surge. Wider black-market spreads raise uncertainty on settlement timing. While direct trade is limited by sanctions, investors still watch possible oil and shipping price effects. Any perceived supply risk can flow into European energy costs and sentiment-sensitive equities.\nLarge parallel-market swings often tighten financial conditions for regional EMs. If the Iran rial crash deepens, some EM FX baskets can see pressure as risk appetite cools. For EUR portfolios, track correlations among oil, EM credit, and high-beta equities. Persistent stress alongside a higher Euro price in Iran may support defensive positioning in the near term.\nInvestor playbook for today\nWatch the Euro price in Iran versus the dollar quote, the gap to official rates, and coin premiums to global bullion. Track crude futures, EM bond ETF flows, and CDS levels for regional sovereigns. In Europe, watch cash equity open and EUR gold bids. Headlines on central bank steps or import funding can change the tone quickly.\nKeep sizing modest in EM risk while volatility stays high. Consider staggered entries, stop-loss discipline, and hedges on oil-sensitive holdings. Some investors review EUR gold exposure when the Iran dollar rate and Iran gold price jump. Treat the Euro price in Iran as a stress barometer, not a trigger. This is information, not investment advice.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe December 28 surge left the Euro price in Iran above 169,000 toman, the dollar near 144,000, and gold coins at a record. This mix signals tight FX supply, high inflation expectations, and fragile confidence. For Germany-based investors, the setup can feed into safe-haven bids, wider EM s"

                "body": "NEW YORK, Dec. 28, 2025, 12:14 p.m. ET \u2014 Market Closed\nGold is holding near historic highs heading into the final trading days of 2025, after a breakout week that pushed the metal decisively above the psychologically important $4,500 level and into fresh record territory.\nAs of midday Sunday in New York, spot gold was around $4,546 per ounce, according to live spot pricing, keeping the market within striking distance of Friday\u2019s all-time peak. [1]\nWith U.S. stock markets closed on Sunday, investors are now looking ahead to Monday\u2019s reopen and a holiday-shortened week where thin liquidity and key macro headlines could amplify moves across rates, the U.S. dollar, and commodities\u2014including gold. The New York Stock Exchange\u2019s core trading session runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. [2]\nWhere gold stands now\nGold enters the new week with momentum intact:\n- Spot gold: around $4,546/oz midday Sunday, per live spot pricing. [3]\n- Recent intraday range cited by major pricing pages: roughly $4,475 to $4,550. [4]\n- Futures reference point: Marketwatch showed December gold futures last updated Friday with a $4,529.10 settlement (and a last price around $4,546). [5]\nBecause it\u2019s Sunday, the headline driver for many traders is not only \u201cprice,\u201d but also when liquidity returns. CME-listed gold futures trade nearly around the clock during the week (with regular daily maintenance breaks), but weekend conditions can still distort price discovery and widen spreads. [6]\nWhat moved gold in the last 48 hours\nGold\u2019s late-December surge has been fueled by a familiar mix\u2014Fed policy expectations, the U.S. dollar, and safe-haven demand\u2014but the intensity has been magnified by holiday-thinned trading.\n1) Record highs on rate-cut expectations and safe-haven demand\nReuters reported that gold surged to a record high in early Asian trading on Friday, supported by safe-haven demand and increasing expectations of further U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. Spot gold was cited around $4,501 at the time, after touching a record $4,530.60 earlier in the session. [7]\nBy the U.S. session, Reuters also described precious metals \u201csmashing records,\u201d with gold reaching about $4,549 at a record high and still up on the day even after easing from the peak. [8]\n2) Year-end market structure is amplifying price swings\nThe same Reuters global markets wrap noted that major U.S. indexes finished a muted post-Christmas session near record peaks while precious metals surged\u2014an environment where light volume can exaggerate moves. [9]\nThat matters for gold investors because fast rallies can attract trend-following inflows\u2014and also raise the odds of sudden profit-taking if a macro catalyst surprises.\n3) The dollar and \u201creal rates\u201d remain the transmission mechanism\nGold\u2019s relationship with the dollar and Treasury yields is back at the center of the story.\nReuters highlighted that a weaker dollar helped make dollar-priced gold more attractive to non-U.S. buyers, and that investors are positioning for 2026 around how many Fed cuts arrive and how soon. [10]\nIn other words: if markets push yields lower and the dollar weakens, gold often benefits; if yields jump or the dollar rebounds sharply, gold can face air pockets\u2014especially after a steep run.\nWall Street context: why stock-market positioning still matters for gold\nEven though gold is a global, cross-asset market, the metal is trading right now in the shadow of a powerful year-end equities narrative:\n- The S&P 500 is pressing toward major milestones near the end of 2025, and investors are watching whether the seasonal \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d holds as the calendar flips. [11]\n- Reuters\u2019 \u201cWeek Ahead\u201d coverage emphasized that Fed minutes and year-end portfolio adjustments could inject volatility during a period when lighter trading volumes can exaggerate moves. [12]\n- Reuters also reported that the Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 75 basis points over its last three meetings of 2025, placing policy in a range of 3.50%\u20133.75%, intensifying deba"

                "body": "USD/CAD slips to near 1.3650 as Oil prices gain on Middle East tensions\n- USD/CAD struggles as the CAD appreciates due to stronger Oil prices.\n- Crude Oil prices rise on Middle East tensions, with Saudi airstrikes and Iran\u2019s war rhetoric raising supply disruption risks.\n- The US Dollar weakens as expectations grow for two additional Fed rate cuts in 2026.\nUSD/CAD depreciates for the second successive session, trading around 1.3660 during the Asian hours on Monday. The pair remains subdued near the five-month low of 1.3642, reached on December 26, as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from stronger Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price gains ground after registering 2.5% losses in the previous session, trading around $57.20 at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices rise amid persistent Middle East tensions, as Saudi airstrikes in Yemen and Iran\u2019s declaration of a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d against the United States (US), Europe, and Israel heighten supply disruption concerns.\nThe USD/CAD pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) loses ground due to the ongoing likelihood of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. Traders will likely observe the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due on Tuesday, which may shed light on internal policy debates shaping the Fed\u2019s outlook for 2026.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows an 81.7% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 77.9% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 18.3% from 22.1% a week ago.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s c"

This may be what's driving market concerns about potential supply disruptions,\" said Yang An, analyst at Haitong Futures.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that some of the thorniest details remain unresolved.\nThe two leaders spoke at a joint press conference late Sunday afternoon after meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said it will be clear \"in a few weeks\" whether negotiations to end the war will succeed.\nThe peace talks were positive. However, there was no breakthrough, and a significant hurdle remains in the form of territorial control of the Donbas region, said IG's analyst Tony Sycamore.\nCrude oil is expected to trade within a $55-$60 type range with an eye also on US enforcement actions against Venezuelan oil shipments and any fallout from the US military strike against ISIS targets in Nigeria, which produces about 1.5 million barrels per day, IG said in a note.

The lack of concrete progress helped oil prices stabilise on Monday, as traders judged that a swift resolution -- and any rapid return of sanctioned Russian supply -- remained uncertain.\nAny credible peace deal could eventually weigh on oil prices by reducing the geopolitical risk premium that has supported the market since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nThat support has been offset by growing worries over a potential supply glut. Major forecasting agencies and analysts have warned that global oil supply could exceed demand in 2026, driven by rising output from non-OPEC producers and slowing consumption growth.\nOil prices have also found recent support from tensions between the United States and Venezuela. Washington has stepped up pressure on Venezuelan crude exports, including measures targeting shipments and buyers, tightening supply from the OPEC member.\n.Written By: Investing.com\nTrading in financial instruments and/or cryptocurrencies involves high risks including the risk of losing some, or all, of your investment amount, and may not be suitable for all investors.

                "body": "US President Donald Trump says Ukraine deal closer but no breakthrough in talks\n|US President Donald Trump said that he made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy over a possible peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Sunday. However, Trump stated that there\u2019s no apparent breakthrough on the flashpoint issue of territory and it might take a few weeks to get it done.\nMarket reaction\nAt the time of writing, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading 0.78% higher on the day to trade at $57.10.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members, the most notable of which is Russia.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "EUR/USD gathers strength above 1.1750 as Fed rate cut prospects pressure US Dollar\n- EUR/USD strengthens to near 1.1775 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Growing expectations for the Fed to implement rate cuts in early 2026 weigh on the US Dollar.\n- Money markets assign only a limited chance to an ECB rate cut in early 2026.\nThe EUR/USD pair trades in positive territory around 1.1775 during the early Asian session on Monday. The prospect of a US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in 2026 weighs on the US Dollar (USD) against the Euro (EUR). Markets brace for US President Donald Trump to nominate a Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Later on Monday, the US Pending Home Sales report for November will be released.\nThe US central bank cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December policy meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%-3.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amidst a cooling labor market and slightly elevated inflation. Markets are also pricing in two additional rate reductions next year, which could drag the Greenback and create a tailwind for the major pair.\nThe possibility that a new Fed Chair to replace Jerome Powell could look to cut rates next year might contribute to the USD\u2019s downside. Trump said that he expects the next Fed chairman to keep interest rates low and never \u201cdisagree\u201d with him.\nAcross the pond, the European Central Bank (ECB) held interest rates steady earlier this month and signaled they would likely remain so for some time. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that the central bank cannot provide forward guidance on future rate moves due to high uncertainty, emphasizing a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach.\nThe money markets have priced in for a 25 bps interest rate cut by the ECB in February 2026, currently remaining below 10%. Signals that the ECB rate cut cycle is ending could underpin the shared currency in the near term.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly stre"

                "body": "EUR/USD: Bulls Anchor at 1.1770 While 1.1919\u20131.2000 Becomes the Real Test\nEUR/USD Price Structure: 1.1770 Support Versus 1.1919\u20131.2000 Ceiling\nEUR/USD is sitting in a classic compression zone: spot trades around 1.1770\u20131.1775, with buyers defending that base while a thick resistance band between 1.1800 and 1.1875 continues to block any sustained breakout. The weekly snapshot shows a clear pattern: each dip toward 1.1770 has attracted demand, while every push into the 1.1800\u20131.1875 pocket has met supply. Above that, the next technical magnet is the 1.1919 projection and then the psychological 1.2000 handle. In other words, the pair is boxed inside a roughly 250\u2013300 pip corridor from 1.1770 support up to 1.2000 resistance, and the current price around 1.1773 is parked right at the lower edge of that bullish structure, not at the top. For a serious repricing of EUR/USD, the market needs to close decisively above the 1.1875\u20131.1919 band; as long as spot remains pinned below that, what we have is an uptrend that is pausing, not a completed bullish move.\nEUR/USD Technical Tone: Breakaway Gap, Higher Lows and a 1.1770 Line in the Sand\nThe recent EUR/USD pattern is not random: the pair has carved out a sequence of higher lows since the last major downswing, and that 1.1770 reaction low is effectively the market\u2019s \u201cline in the sand.\u201d The breakaway gap that formed on the way up created a structural shelf, and price keeps snapping back to that zone and holding. That is exactly why the last dip into 1.1770 was described as a \u201cgift\u201d for buyers \u2013 the market tested the gap area, flushed weak hands, and then turned back up. The micro-resistance at 1.1780 is the first hurdle; once EUR/USD can absorb offers there, the path opens to 1.1919 and then to the broader resistance shelf at 1.2000. The pattern of higher lows underneath a flat or slightly rising resistance band is classic bullish continuation: buyers are willing to pay more on every pullback, while sellers are forced to defend the same area repeatedly. That pressure usually resolves in the direction of the underlying trend, as long as the key floor \u2013 here 1.1770 \u2013 is not lost on a daily close.\nEUR/USD vs USD Macro: Metals Mania, Fed Path and What It Means for the Dollar Leg\nThe macro backdrop explains why EUR/USD is drifting higher rather than breaking lower. Gold is trading near $4,531\u2013$4,550 an ounce after printing records above $4,549, and silver has exploded to the $76\u2013$79 region with year-to-date gains of roughly 160\u2013220%, depending on the benchmark. At the same time, copper has pushed to around $5.90 per pound on COMEX and over $12,000 per tonne on the LME, up 30\u201340% this year. That combination \u2013 XAU/USD near $4,550, silver near $79, copper at record territory \u2013 is not a strong-dollar environment. It signals reflation, liquidity, and a market already positioning for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, while still needing hedges against fiscal and geopolitical risk. When the market prices at least two Fed cuts for 2026 and sees the dollar weaken on days when metals rip, the USD leg softens structurally, even if short bursts of strength appear around data. For EUR/USD, a softer USD plus a still-intact Eurozone means that dips toward 1.1770 are being bought rather than aggressively sold, especially with Wall Street equity indices hovering near record highs and risk appetite not collapsing.\nEUR/USD in the Cross-FX Matrix: USD Weakness Shows Up Beyond the Euro\nThe EUR/USD story is consistent with the broader USD tape if you look across G-10. The USD/CAD cross has broken down through 1.3750 and is gravitating toward the 200-week EMA with a major floor around 1.3600, signalling that the Canadian dollar is no longer under heavy pressure despite soft liquidity. USD/CHF has slid toward the 0.7900 area, where the Swiss National Bank has made it clear it is watching the franc\u2019s strength; that creates a de-facto floor for the dollar there. In USD/JPY, price is oscillating in a \u00a5155\u2013\u00a5158 range, wi"

The stock sits between its 52-week low at $60.62 and high at $74.38, in the upper half of the range but not at extremes. At this level Coca-Cola\u2019s market cap is about $300.6B, with a trailing P/E of roughly 23.1 and a dividend yield of 2.9% based on a $2.04 annual payout. Beta near 0.39 underlines that NYSE:KO is built for low volatility and cash compounding rather than aggressive growth.\nEarnings momentum and margin expansion\nIn the September 2025 quarter, Coca-Cola delivered revenue of $12.46B, up 5.07% year-on-year. Volume growth was modest, so most of the improvement came from pricing and mix, showing that the company still has strong pricing power across its portfolio. Operating expenses were $3.63B, slightly down by 1.31%, which means cost discipline supported the top line. Net income rose sharply to $3.70B, a 29.78% increase, expanding the net margin to 29.67% from roughly the mid-20s a year ago. EBITDA reached $4.30B, up 13.64%, which confirms operating leverage as revenue grows and margins widen. Earnings per share came in at $0.82, up 6.49%, consistent with a profile of mid-single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit EPS growth driven by both pricing and efficiency.\nCash flow strength and balance sheet profile\nThe cash engine behind NYSE:KO remains strong. Cash from operations in the latest quarter was $5.04B, up more than 500% year-on-year due to normalization after prior exceptional items. Free cash flow was $3.67B, only 7.58% lower than the previous year despite heavy one-offs earlier in the cycle, which still leaves ample coverage for dividends and reinvestment. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments total $15.78B despite a 13.12% decline year-on-year as litigation and acquisition-related payments flowed out. Total assets stand at $106.05B, liabilities at $72.78B, and equity at $33.27B, implying a price-to-book around 9.66 at current prices. Profitability ratios are robust, with return on assets at 9.58% and return on capital around 12.46%, while the debt-to-equity ratio of 1.30 signals leverage that is significant but clearly manageable for a company with this level of recurring cash generation.\nDividend power and yield-on-cost potential\nAt around $69.87, NYSE:KO pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51, or $2.04 annually, which translates into a 2.9% yield. The payout ratio is roughly two thirds of earnings, comfortable for a cash-rich, capital-light staples franchise. The key is the track record: more than sixty consecutive years of dividend increases put Coca-Cola in the very top tier of income names globally. With EPS growing in the 6\u20138% band and free cash flow normalizing upwards as exceptional cash uses fade, there is room for continued mid-single-digit or better annual dividend growth. That combination of a near-3% starting yield and consistent increases is what matters; over a decade, a patient holder of NYSE:KO can realistically see a significantly higher yield on cost without taking high volatility risk.\nValuation framework for NYSE:KO\nOn forward numbers, NYSE:KO trades at about 23 times earnings, roughly in line with its five-year average and not stretched by historical standards. Price-to-sales and price-to-book multiples also cluster close to their long-term norms. Management and analyst expectations for the next few years converge around 5\u20136% organic revenue growth and approximately 8% EPS growth. On that profile, the implied growth-adjusted multiple is rich compared with cyclical or high-growth names but appropriate for a defensive compounder with highly visible cash flows.

The pair gains ground as the US Dollar (USD) faces challenges, which could be attributed to growing expectations of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026.\nTraders are likely to focus on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due on Tuesday, which may shed light on internal policy debates shaping the Fed\u2019s outlook for 2026.\nThe US central bank lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows an 81.7% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 77.9% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 18.3% from 22.1% a week ago.\nThe latest weekly US labor market data sent mixed signals. Initial Jobless Claims declined to 214K from 224K in the prior week, beating the 223K market forecast. Meanwhile, Continuing Jobless Claims rose to 1.923 million from 1.885 million, while the four-week average of Initial Claims edged lower to 216.75K from 217.5K.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) lowered the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.75% in December, with a close 5\u20134 vote highlighting persistent inflation concerns. While inflation cooled to 3.2% in November, it remains well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target. UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in the third quarter, meeting expectations, but the BoE projects flat growth in the final quarter.\nBoE Governor Andrew Bailey signaled that interest rates are expected to ease further in a gradual manner, but cautioned that the scope for additional cuts is limited as rates approach their neutral level. Any moves beyond the latest cut are likely to be finely balanced and strongly driven by incoming data.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

                "body": "Silver Price Forecast: XAG/USD turns upside down on progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks\n|- Silver price corrects from the all-time high of $84.03 amid progress in peace talks on the war in Ukraine.\n- Elon Musk condemns China\u2019s export restrictions on Silver, starting from January 1, 2026.\n- The Fed is expected to deliver at least two interest rate cuts next year.\nSilver price (XAG/USD) retraces to near $75.00 in the Asian trading session on Monday from its all-time high of $84.03 posted in opening trading hours. The white metal gives up its intraday gains and turns slightly negative as United States (US) President Donald Trump has signaled progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\nUS President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have stated after a meeting in Florida, earlier in the day, that a deal on pace in Ukraine is close to being reached, flagging some key issues remaining unresolved, such as how much territory Ukraine will hand over to Russia, and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which is currently under Russian control, BBC reported.\nSigns of easing geopolitical tensions often diminish the appeal of safe-haven assets, such as Silver.\nMeanwhile, the outlook of the Silver price remains firm amid headlines stating China\u2019s export curbs on the precious metal and firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver more interest rate cuts in 2026 than it had projected in the policy meeting announced in the middle of December.\nBeijing has announced new restrictions on the export of Silver, starting from 1 January 2026, limiting smaller exporters from selling the white metal overseas, raising global supply concerns. Chinese authorities have stated that exporters of silver must obtain government licences, with eligibility limited to large, state-approved firms meeting strict production and financing thresholds.\nIn response, Tesla\u2019s leader, Elon Musk, has strongly condemned Beijing\u2019s decision, highlighting Silver\u2019s demand in various industries. \u201cThis is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter, which is now X.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows that the odds of the Fed reducing interest rates at least 50 bps in 2026 are 73.3%. However, the Fed\u2019s dot plot showed that policymakers collectively see the Federal Fund Rate heading to 3.4% by the end of 2026, indicating that there won\u2019t be more than one interest rate cut.\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial secto"

The pair weakens after the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) Summary of Opinions from the December policy meeting reinforced expectations of continued tightening in 2026, supporting Japanese Yen (JPY) stabilization, sustaining upward pressure on JGB yields, and reducing the risk of abrupt policy shifts.\nThe BoJ Summary showed one member arguing rates should rise steadily to avoid falling behind the curve. Another noted Japan\u2019s real policy rate is the lowest globally, supporting hikes given FX-driven inflation risks.

Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 18.3% from 22.1% a week ago.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The AUD/USD pair strengthens as the Aussie Dollar finds support amid growing expectations of interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).\nThe RBA\u2019s December Meeting Minutes indicated that board members are becoming less confident that monetary policy remains sufficiently restrictive. The minutes also indicated the board is prepared to tighten policy if inflation does not ease as anticipated, putting the spotlight on the fourth-quarter CPI report due January 28. Analysts say that a stronger-than-expected Q4 core inflation print could prompt a rate hike at the RBA\u2019s February 3 meeting.\nBloomberg reported Sunday that China\u2019s Ministry of Finance plans to expand targeted investment in priority sectors, including advanced manufacturing, technological innovation, and human capital development. The announcement followed a year-end meeting outlining next year\u2019s fiscal policy priorities. Any impact on China\u2019s economy could affect the AUD, given Australia\u2019s close trade ties with China.\nChina launched the \u201cJustice Mission 2025\u201d drills on Monday, simulating a blockade around Taiwan, according to China Daily, citing Senior Colonel Shi Yi of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command. The exercises underscore ongoing geopolitical risk in Asia, keeping markets alert to potential spillovers into shipping, semiconductors, and regional FX if the drills are prolonged or repeated.\nUS Dollar declines amid ongoing odds of more Fed rate cuts\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is depreciating and trading around 97.90 at the time of writing. The Greenback faces challenges amid ongoing expectations of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. Traders are likely to focus on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due on Tuesday.\n- The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\n- The CME FedWatch tool shows an 81.7% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 77.9% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 18.3% from 22.1% a week ago.\n- US Initial Jobless Claims declined to 214K from 224K in the prior week, beating the 223K market forecast. Meanwhile, Continuing Jobless Claims rose to 1.923 million from 1.885 million, while the four-week average of Initial Claims edged lower to 216.75K from 217.5K.\n- The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released delayed data showing that preliminary US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Annualized expanded 4.3% in the July\u2013September period. The reading exceeded market expectations of a 3.3% increase and surpassed the 3.8% growth recorded in the previous quarter.\n- Australia\u2019s headline inflation rose to 3.8% in October 2025 from 3.6% in September, remaining above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range. As a result, markets are increasingly pricing in a rate hike as early as February 2026, with both the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank projecting a rise to 3.85% at the RBA\u2019s first policy meeting of the year.\n- Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations rose to 4.7% in December from November\u2019s three-month low of 4.5%, supporting the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) hawkish stance.\nAustralian Dollar reaches new 14-month highs above 0.6700\nAUD/USD is hovering around 0.6720 on Monday.

                "body": "The Australian Dollar stabilises near a 14-month high of 0.6724, driven by anticipation of interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The currency gains momentum against the US Dollar on expectations of further economic tightening.\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s December meeting notes reveal concerns about the current monetary policy\u2019s effectiveness, with the possibility of tighter measures if inflation stays high. Speculations of rate adjustments at the February meeting loom, ahead of the release of fourth-quarter CPI data.\nImpact Of China\u2019s Economic Plans\nChina\u2019s economic plans, including investment in manufacturing and technology, could impact the AUD through trade ties. Additionally, geopolitical tensions due to China\u2019s military activities around Taiwan might influence markets sensitive to trade and currency fluctuations.\nThe US Dollar Index shows depreciation, trading at 97.90 amid likelihoods of Federal Reserve rate cuts by 2026. Recent US economic indicators reveal jobless claims fluctuations and GDP growth of 4.3% exceeding expectations.\nAustralia witnesses a rise in inflation to 3.8% in October 2025, above the target range, prompting rate hike speculations. The AUD/USD maintains upward momentum, hovering around 0.6720, with key technical indicators pointing to a bullish trend.\nThe close trade relationship with China and fluctuations in Iron Ore prices considerably affect the AUD. A positive trade balance supports the AUD, being Australia\u2019s primary export, impacting its value and economic health.\nCentral Bank Divergence\nThe current divergence between central banks suggests we should favor the Australian Dollar over the US Dollar. The Reserve Bank of Australia is showing signs it may hike rates again, while the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting in 2026. This fundamental difference creates a clear trading bias heading into the new year.\nWe see that markets are increasingly anticipating an RBA rate hike at the February 3 meeting. This expectation is fueled by Australian inflation which, at 3.8% in October 2025, remains stubbornly above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range. The upcoming fourth-quarter CPI report on January 28 will be the key data point confirming this move.\nThis bullish outlook for the Aussie dollar is further supported by strong commodity prices. We note that iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange have held firm above $130 a tonne, a historically robust level that directly benefits Australian export revenues. China\u2019s plans for targeted investment should also continue to support demand for Australia\u2019s raw materials.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US Dollar is facing headwinds from the Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish stance. After delivering 75 basis points in rate cuts during 2025, market odds suggest more easing is on the way in 2026. Tomorrow\u2019s release of the FOMC December Meeting Minutes will be closely watched for any change in this outlook.\nGiven this setup, we should consider buying AUD/USD call options with expiration dates in March 2026. This strategy would allow us to profit from a potential rise in the pair following the RBA\u2019s February meeting. It also provides a defined risk, limited to the premium paid for the options.\nHowever, we must remain aware of the geopolitical risks. The recent Chinese military drills simulating a blockade of Taiwan could trigger a flight to safety, benefiting the safe-haven US Dollar. Such a \u201crisk-off\u201d event would likely see the Australian Dollar weaken, regardless of central bank policy.\nThe most critical event risk is the Australian inflation data on January 28. If the reading comes in softer than expected, it would significantly reduce the probability of an RBA rate hike. Such a surprise would likely cause a sharp reversal in the AUD/USD, unwinding its recent gains."

                "body": "China indicated plans for a more active fiscal policy in 2026 to support growth amid external challenges. The Ministry of Finance aims to increase investment in sectors like advanced manufacturing, tech innovation, and human capital development. This announcement comes after a fiscal policy meeting outlining priorities for the following year.\nThe AUD/USD pair showed a slight increase of 0.02% to trade at 0.6716. Key factors affecting the Australian Dollar (AUD) include Australian interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), and Iron Ore prices, as it is Australia\u2019s largest export. China\u2019s economy also plays a role, given its status as Australia\u2019s largest trading partner.\nThe Role Of Reserve Bank Of Australia\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia impacts the AUD by adjusting interest rates to maintain inflation between 2-3%. High interest rates compared to other banks generally support the AUD, with the opposite effect for lower rates. Quantitative measures by the RBA can also influence the currency\u2019s value.\nThe state of China\u2019s economy significantly impacts AUD, with strong Chinese growth leading to increased demand for Australian exports, hence boosting the AUD. Iron Ore prices are pivotal to AUD value, given its significance in trade, with price rises generally boosting AUD strength. A positive Trade Balance, resulting from higher export demand, also strengthens the AUD.\nWith today\u2019s date being December 29, 2025, China\u2019s signal for sustained fiscal support in 2026 is a significant development for the new year. This proactive stance suggests Beijing is committed to shoring up its economy, which is a positive sign for its key trading partners. We should therefore consider positioning for strength in the Australian dollar over the coming weeks.\nThis stimulus is crucial, as we\u2019ve seen some mixed signals from China\u2019s economy recently. For instance, the official manufacturing PMI for November 2025 came in at a contractionary 49.0, reflecting ongoing struggles in the sector. This new fiscal push is designed to directly counter that weakness and stabilize growth heading into 2026.\nImpact Of Chinese Economic Policies\nThe direct beneficiary of this is the demand for industrial commodities, especially iron ore. We have already seen iron ore prices rally to around $138 per ton in recent weeks, a significant rise from levels seen earlier in the year. China\u2019s pledge for more investment in manufacturing and infrastructure should provide a solid floor for these prices, directly benefiting Australian export revenues.\nThis external support for the AUD comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of Australia is maintaining a hawkish stance. With inflation in Australia still proving sticky, running at 5.2% in the third quarter of 2025, the RBA has held its cash rate steady at 4.10%. This relatively high interest rate continues to make the currency attractive.\nGiven this backdrop, we should look to establish bullish positions using derivatives, such as buying AUD/USD call options with expirations in late January or February 2026. Current market volatility is relatively low, making option premiums reasonably priced for a potential upward move. This strategy allows us to capitalize on a stronger Australian dollar while clearly defining our risk.\nLooking ahead, we must monitor the specific details of China\u2019s spending plans as they are released. Confirmation of significant investment in heavy industry would reinforce this bullish view. Conversely, any wavering in Beijing\u2019s commitment or a sharp downturn in commodity prices would be a signal to reassess our position."

This report, published about 10 days after the Monetary Policy Statement, forecasts inflation and economic growth and is issued 8 times per year.\nThe USD/JPY remains stable as investors await the BOJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions. With discussions about a potential new Federal Reserve Chair who might cut rates next year, the US Dollar\u2019s performance against the Japanese Yen could be impacted.\nUSDJPY Resistance and Support Levels\nFor the USD/JPY pair, the first resistance level is at the December 9 high of 156.95, followed by December 22 high at 157.70, and the November 20 high at 157.89. On the downside, the December 26 low of 155.96 provides some support, with further declines possibly reaching December 19 low at 155.44 and December 17 low at 154.51.\nThe Bank of Japan, central to Japan\u2019s monetary policy, targets an inflation rate of around 2%. Since 2013, BOJ employed Quantitative and Qualitative Easing and introduced negative interest rates in 2016. This stimulated the economy but weakened the Yen particularly in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, BOJ moved away from this policy as rising inflation due to a weaker Yen and increasing energy prices led to surpassing its inflation target.\nWith the Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions due tonight, we see USD/JPY trading in a tight range, suggesting the market is holding its breath for a catalyst. This quiet period is an opportunity to position for the volatility that typically follows such key releases. The main focus will be on any new language regarding inflation and future policy tightening.\nWe are watching for signs that the BOJ is concerned about persistent price pressures, especially after Japan\u2019s core CPI for November 2025 came in at a firm 2.7%. If the summary reinforces a hawkish outlook, it could signal a faster pace of policy normalization than currently priced in. This would likely strengthen the yen, putting pressure on the initial support level at 155.96.\nMarket Outlook and Trading Strategies\nOn the other side of the pair, uncertainty around the new Federal Reserve Chair is weighing on the dollar. The prospect of a more dovish chair replacing Jerome Powell, combined with U.S. core PCE cooling to 2.5% in its latest reading, has increased bets on rate cuts in 2026. This policy divergence between a tightening BOJ and a potentially easing Fed creates a bearish long-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFor derivative traders, the elevated implied volatility on weekly options expiring this Friday suggests a significant price swing is expected. A long straddle or strangle strategy could be effective to trade the breakout, regardless of the direction. This allows us to profit from a sharp move without needing to predict its exact path.\nFor those with a directional bias, buying puts on USD/JPY could be a way to position for a hawkish BOJ report, targeting a move toward the 155.44 and 154.51 support levels. Conversely, if we believe the BOJ will sound cautious on growth, call options targeting the 156.95 resistance might offer value. The risk-reward is defined, which is crucial around a binary event like this.\nWe remember the market reaction to the October 2025 policy statement, when the pair moved over 200 pips in the subsequent 24 hours. Given the fundamental shift away from ultra-loose policy that began back in March 2024, these meetings now carry significant weight. Being unprepared for a sudden move could prove costly."

                "body": "The Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions put USD/JPY under the spotlight on Monday, December 29, amid shifting sentiment toward the rate path. This month, the BoJ raised interest rates to 0.75% but signaled a cautious policy stance, sending USD/JPY into the yen intervention zone (157-160). Since raising interest rates, Tokyo inflation cooled sharply, supporting a more dovish BoJ rate path.\nDespite softer inflation, USD/JPY has given up the lion\u2019s share of its BoJ-driven gains. Yen intervention warnings and speculation about an incoming Fed Chair supporting lower rates have pushed the pair lower.\nThe BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions pointed to a more hawkish stance, while the markets are betting on a March Fed rate cut, suggesting a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s December interest rate decision and Tokyo inflation numbers tempered expectations of aggressive rate hikes to achieve monetary policy normalization. Meanwhile, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions shed more light on policymakers\u2019 views on the economy, wage growth, inflation, and rate hikes. Policymakers\u2019 opinions included:\nWhile there was a hawkish spin to the opinions, several policymakers called for caution, discussing the need to assess the impact of higher nominal rates on the economy and prices. These opinions included:\nDespite calls for caution, recent economic data suggest the economy and prices are moving in line with the BoJ\u2019s outlook. The hawkish sentiment had a greater influence, bolstering demand for the yen, pushing USD/JPY lower in early trading.\nUSD/JPY briefly climbed to a post-report high of 156.486 before falling to a low of 156.058. USD/JPY price action reflected a shift in sentiment, given the likelihood of further BoJ rate hikes narrowing US-Japan rate differentials.\nLater on Monday, US economic indicators are likely to influence US dollar demand and USD/JPY. Pending home sales and the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index will be in focus. Given the strong third-quarter GDP numbers, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index will likely influence sentiment more than housing sector numbers.\nEconomists expect the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index to increase from -10.4 in November to -2.5 in December.\nA weaker-than-expected Dallas Fed Manufacturing index would signal a loss of economic momentum, weighing on the US dollar.\nWhile the data will influence US dollar demand, Fed commentary will be key. Support for further rate cuts on inflation outlook and a weaker labor market would weigh on the US dollar, pushing USD/JPY lower.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut increased from 53.3% on December 26 to 54.8% on December 27.\nLooking ahead, the prospects for further BoJ rate hikes, a new Fed Chair, and a deteriorating US labor market are likely to remain the key themes. These scenarios continue to support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, technical indicators, and fundamentals will require close monitoring.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY remained above its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating a bullish bias. While technicals remained bullish, fundamentals are outweighing the technical structure, indicating a bearish outlook.\nA drop below the 155 support level would bring the 50-day EMA into play. If breached, the 200-day EMA would be the next key technical support level. Crucially, a sustained break below the EMAs would signal a bearish trend reversal, paving the way toward 150.\nIn my view, expectations of further BoJ rate hikes, yen intervention threats, and bets on a Fed rate cut indicate a negative price outlook. However, BoJ communication on its neutral interest rate and the upcoming FOMC Meeting Minutes will be key.\nA higher neutral interest rate level would point to multiple BoJ rate hikes and a narrower US"

                "body": "USD/CAD slips to near 1.3650 as Oil prices gain on Middle East tensions\n- USD/CAD struggles as the CAD appreciates due to stronger Oil prices.\n- Crude Oil prices rise on Middle East tensions, with Saudi airstrikes and Iran\u2019s war rhetoric raising supply disruption risks.\n- The US Dollar weakens as expectations grow for two additional Fed rate cuts in 2026.\nUSD/CAD depreciates for the second successive session, trading around 1.3660 during the Asian hours on Monday. The pair remains subdued near the five-month low of 1.3642, reached on December 26, as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from stronger Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price gains ground after registering 2.5% losses in the previous session, trading around $57.20 at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices rise amid persistent Middle East tensions, as Saudi airstrikes in Yemen and Iran\u2019s declaration of a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d against the United States (US), Europe, and Israel heighten supply disruption concerns.\nThe USD/CAD pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) loses ground due to the ongoing likelihood of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. Traders will likely observe the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due on Tuesday, which may shed light on internal policy debates shaping the Fed\u2019s outlook for 2026.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows an 81.7% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 77.9% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 18.3% from 22.1% a week ago.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s c"

The potential downside for a major pair might be limited, as the Bank of England (BoE) guided that monetary policy will remain on a gradual downward path.\nThe BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee decided to cut a quarter point in its benchmark interest rate to 3.75% at its December meeting, the first cut since last August. Governor Andrew Bailey said during the press conference that rates are likely to continue on a gradual downward path, but \"how much further we go becomes a closer call\" with each cut.\nOn the USD\u2019s front, traders anticipate two rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026 due to a cooling labor market and easing inflation. Financial markets are pricing in nearly an 18.3% odds that the US central bank will reduce the interest rates at its next policy meeting in January, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Firm Fed dovish bets could weigh on the Greenback and create a tailwind for the pair in the near term.\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3486. The 100-day EMA edges higher and price holds above it, preserving the medium-term uptrend. A pullback would meet dynamic support at this average, keeping the broader bias intact. RSI sits at 66 (bullish) after easing from recent highs, pointing to firm momentum without an overbought signal. Initial support stands at the Bollinger middle band at 1.3393, with the 100-day EMA below at 1.3336. Holding above this zone would keep dips contained and the topside favored.\nBollinger Bands drift higher, with price entrenched in the upper half and approaching the upper band at 1.3547, indicating persistent bullish pressure while not overstretched. The bands have modestly widened in recent sessions, signaling firm momentum. A close above that barrier would open scope for an extension, while a rejection would leave room for consolidation toward the lower band at 1.3240.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling.

                "body": "The GBP/USD started last Monday around the 1.33785 mark and finished on Friday around the 1.34978 ratio. The GBP/USD correlated well to other major currencies which gained against the USD most of last week. Holiday season price action which began last week certainly brought lighter volumes.\nBut while some may question the gains made in the GBP against the USD, it does appear behavioral sentiment has shifted as weaker USD centric attitudes prevail.\nSustained higher values going into the weekend may be looked at suspiciously by some speculators of the GBP/USD, but the currency pair is touching values seen in late August and in September of this year without actually challenging higher apexes. The 1.34978 heights clearly have 1.35000 within sights and financial institutions may have interesting near-term decisions to make in the days ahead leading into the New Year\u2019s holiday.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nMid-Term Outlook and Near-Term Reactions\nThe GBP/USD did touch the 1.36000 level rather consistently in late August and September of this year. In fact the 1.37000 mark was also penetrated briefly on the 17th of September. That doesn\u2019t mean that the 1.34978 ratio now displayed is cheap, but implies that shifting mid-term outlook which views USD weaker centric price action as a possibility due to upcoming power shifts in the U.S Federal Reserve, may be impacting financial institutions now and the way they are positioning the GBP/USD.\nThe U.S released a better than expected GDP report last week, but its results were published late, due to the government shutdown a couple of months ago, thus its results are being debated. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next FOMC meeting is in late January and opinion varies regarding what the central bank will do regarding interest rates in the immediate future. However, this Tuesday, yes, while a lot of the financial markets are not paying attention because of being on vacation, the Fed will release its FOMC Meeting Minutes report. The Fed\u2019s publication this week could prove lively reading, because it is known that open disagreements are brewing among the FOMC voting members. Who will be paying attention?\nHolidays and Speculative Trading\nHoliday trading volumes are certainly going to impact the markets this coming week. However, the GBP/USD is one of the most heavily traded currency pairs in the world.\n- Forex traders will be active on Monday and Tuesday of this week, while the volumes will not match normal trading conditions, the GBP/USD should be watched along with other major currency pairs.\n- Sentiment shifts in Forex regarding the USD may make the first couple of days trading this week worthwhile.\n- Volumes will come to a crawl on New Year\u2019s eve and Friday\u2019s price action may be quite quiet too.\n- A key barometer may be the 1.35000 level, but traders need to be prepared for possible volatile conditions and the prospect of sudden spikes from large orders that are imbalanced.\nGBP/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.34310 to 1.35430\nThe move higher in the GBP/USD mirrored movements in the EUR and other currencies against the USD this past week. Cautiousness the week before, suddenly changed into a more optimistic approach regarding USD centric weakness potential early this past Monday and the sustained move higher didn\u2019t produce a reaction reversal. The lack of a strong reversal, and the ability to easily stay above the 1.34000 level and then the 1.34500 mark is an indication the GBP/USD has traction.\nDue to the holiday season and lighter volumes than normal being seen in Forex, traders should remain careful and not get overly ambitious. If the 1.35000 ratio is penetrated and sustained this could indicate financial institutions believe the GBP/USD is within a sincere bullish trend. Speculators aiming for the highs attained in September of this year should not get greedy. The potential for a reactionary bout of selling in the GBP/USD with light volumes prevalent is a danger.\nReady to trade"

While inflation cooled to 3.2% in November, it remains well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target. UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in the third quarter, meeting expectations, but the BoE projects flat growth in the final quarter.\nBoE Governor Andrew Bailey signaled that interest rates are expected to ease further in a gradual manner, but cautioned that the scope for additional cuts is limited as rates approach their neutral level.

                "body": "What if Bitcoin blocks signaled the New Year? Creating Universal Bitcoin Time but trapping holders in a tax nightmare\nReplacing the clock with consensus height turns the year-end into a statistical lottery where \"midnight\" might arrive days late.\nBitcoin miners produced block 929,699 on Dec. 27. What if that was the signal for a New Year\u2019s moment, rather than our traditional calendar?\nThe pitch is that block height, the ordered count of blocks every full node can verify, can act as a calendar layer for a market that trades and settles across jurisdictions.\nFor argument's sake, we'll use Bitcoin Block Explorer and the last observed chain tip in this snapshot at height 929,699, timestamped Sat, 27 Dec 2025 09:47:19 UTC, with a mempool around 5,324 transactions at the time of the page\u2019s update.\nThe same source listed difficulty near 148.26T.\nAccording to YCharts, Bitcoin network hash rate was about 1.150B TH/s (about 1,150 EH/s) as of Dec. 26, 2025, up about 62.69% from a year earlier.\nYCharts also showed average difficulty around 148.26T, up about 36.62% year over year, and estimated the next difficulty adjustment around Jan. 8, 2026, with an estimate near +1.40% at the time of capture.\nOn the supply side, MacroMicro put circulating supply around 19,966,689.8 BTC as of Dec. 24, 2025.\nBitcoin trading in the $88,000\u2013$89,000 zone in late-December conditions.\nNew Year UBT (Universal Bitcoin Time)\nThe idea resonates because midnight by civil time is a jurisdictional convention, while consensus height is enforced by nodes running common rules.\nDual time has precedent. In the United States, railroads consolidated hundreds of local times into standardized zones in 1883, and adoption met resistance because it felt like a loss of autonomy, according to the National Museum of American History.\nUTC itself remains a governed system. NIST describes UTC as the internationally agreed time standard and maintains UTC(NIST) as the U.S. representation.\nTimekeeping politics also has not ended. The BIPM notes that leap seconds create discontinuities that can break infrastructure, and international bodies have moved toward changing how UTC handles UT1-UTC divergence by or before 2035.\nHeight and wall time are not interchangeable, and Bitcoin\u2019s rules make that clear. The network targets a 10-minute average block interval and uses difficulty adjustments every 2,016 blocks (about two weeks) to keep that average over time.\nBlock discovery is stochastic, and even with steady hash rate the number of blocks per day varies, a point Blockchain.com flags in its charting.\nTimestamps inside blocks are not atomic time either. Under the Bitcoin Wiki timestamp rules, a block time is valid if it is greater than the median of the prior 11 blocks\u2019 timestamps and less than network-adjusted time plus two hours.\nThat means \u201ctime\u201d in the header is bounded but not a substitute for a clock.\nA \u201cBlock New Year\u201d can be defined as the first block mined after a chosen height H.\nUnder the standard proof-of-work model, the waiting time for that next block follows an exponential distribution with a 10-minute mean, consistent with the mining process described in Bitcoin Developer Documentation.\nThat turns the countdown into a shared suspense event: everyone can agree on the number that flips the year, and nobody can know the second in advance.\nA block-based \u201cyear\u201d also has a measurable drift profile. If a community defines a year as 52,560 blocks (144 per day times 365), the expected length is 365 days.\nRandomness alone produces a multi-day band around that target\nUnder a 10-minute exponential model, a 90% band for the end of a 52,560-block year is about plus or minus 2.6 days.\nA 95% band is about plus or minus 3.1 days, so the boundary is auditable yet not tied to a solar calendar.\nAnchoring those abstractions to the current tip makes the concept testable. Starting from height 929,699 at 09:47 UTC on Dec. 27 and using the 10-minute target as a baseline, round-number milestones come "

                "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) has had a muted Christmas, slipping below the key psychological level of $90,000 and cooling year-end optimism across the crypto market.\nAccording to market analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin is consolidating around the mid-$88,000 range, signaling rising market indecision. This sideways price action points to a clear \u201cwait-and-see\u201d phase, where neither bulls nor bears have gained decisive control, leaving the next major move unresolved.\nWell, the $90,000 level has long served as a key psychological threshold for Bitcoin, and slipping below it has dampened short-term sentiment, especially among retail traders who often view such levels as signals of market strength. However, consolidation beneath resistance is not inherently bearish.\nHistorically, Bitcoin has often paused to build liquidity and momentum after major moves, particularly during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor expectations. At its current price of $87,423, according to CoinGecko, this sideways action may reflect stabilization rather than weakness.\nBitcoin on Track for Weakest Q4 in 7 Years as Price Slides 22%\nAccording to on-chain market analyst Coin Bureau, Bitcoin is on track for its weakest fourth-quarter performance in seven years, challenging the long-held belief that Q4 is typically Bitcoin\u2019s strongest period and fueling renewed investor concern.\nPer Coinglass data, Bitcoin is down 22.54% on a monthly basis this quarter, an unusual break from its historically strong year-end performance. The last time Q4 showed similar weakness was in 2018, when Bitcoin plunged 42.16% amid the depths of the post-bull-market crash.\nNotably, Coin Bureau highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s weakness stems from macro uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and subdued speculation, as rising global interest rates, tighter liquidity, and persistent inflation continue to pressure risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, this year.\nMeanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $188.6 million in outflows on December 23, marking a fourth consecutive day of withdrawals as institutional investors reduce exposure ahead of the Christmas holiday, according to SoSoValue."

                "body": "What Is ? Complete Guide (2025 Update)\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, few events generate as much buzz as the\nWhether you\u2019re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, this complete guide breaks down everything you need to know: from the mechanics and history to impacts on price, miners, and altcoins. Let\u2019s explore why the\nWhat Is and Why Does It Happen?\nConceived by Bitcoin\u2019s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the halving mimics the scarcity of precious metals like gold. Miners secure the network by solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks. In return, they earn freshly minted BTC plus transaction fees. The halving slows this issuance, promoting deflationary economics and potentially driving up value as demand grows against a shrinking supply influx.\nUnlike fiat currencies prone to inflation, Bitcoin\u2019s halving ensures predictable scarcity, making it a unique asset in the financial landscape.\nHow Does the Bitcoin Halving Work?\nThe process is fully automated and hardcoded into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n- Block Mining: Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, adding a block roughly every 10 minutes.\n- Block Height Tracking: The network monitors the total blocks mined. At multiples of 210,000 (e.g., 210,000, 420,000), the reward halves.\n- Reward Adjustment: The subsidy drops by 50%\u2014from 50 BTC initially to 25, then 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and so on.\n- Transaction Fees Take Over: As rewards diminish, fees become miners\u2019 primary income, incentivizing network efficiency.\nThis cycle repeats 32 times until around 2140, when the last satoshi is mined, and Bitcoin becomes fully deflationary.\nBitcoin Halving History: Key Dates and Price Movements\nBitcoin has undergone four halvings since 2009, each marking pivotal market moments. Here\u2019s a comprehensive table summarizing them:\nNotice the pattern? Each halving has preceded massive bull runs, though with varying timelines and short-term volatility. The 2024 halving was amplified by spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, drawing institutional capital and pushing BTC to new heights by late 2025.\nImpacts of : Miners, Price, and the Market\nThe halving creates a supply shock, halving daily new BTC issuance (from ~900 to ~450 post-2024). If demand remains steady or grows, prices tend to rise. Key effects include:\n- Miners: Revenue halves, pressuring inefficient operations to shut down. Hashrate dips temporarily, but survivors consolidate and upgrade, leading to a more robust network.\n- Price Volatility: Short-term dips are common as miners sell holdings, followed by rallies from scarcity hype.\n- Market Cycles: Halvings often ignite bull markets, boosting liquidity across crypto.\nIn 2025, post-halving miner efficiency improved, with fees rising amid ETF-driven volume.\nNext : When Is It and What to Expect?\nThe fifth halving looms at block 1,050,000, slashing rewards from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC. Estimated for April 2028 (as of late 2025, ~829 days away), exact timing varies with block production speed.\nExpect similar dynamics: supply crunch, miner shakeouts, and potential rallies. With growing adoption, this could be the most impactful yet, especially if nation-states and corporations deepen BTC reserves.\nHow Affects Altcoins and Triggers Altseason\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominates (50-60%), halving-fueled BTC surges create spillover effects. Post-halving bull runs often lead to \u201caltseason,\u201d where capital flows from BTC to altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP.\nSigns of altseason: BTC dominance drops below 50%, 75%+ of top altcoins outperform BTC over 90 days. Historical halvings have sparked these rotations, multiplying gains for riskier assets\u2014but with higher volatility.\nDebunking Common Myths\n- Myth: Halving guarantees 10x gains. Reality: Past performance isn\u2019t future-proof; external factors like regulation matter.\n- Myth: All miners die post-halving. Reality: Efficient ones thrive; price rises often compensate.\n- Myth: Hal"

                "body": "Heading into 2026, crypto investors have plenty of reasons to be nervous. Across the board, top cryptocurrencies are down anywhere from 10% to 50% for the year.\nWith that in mind, I've put together a list of three cryptocurrencies that should hold up best in 2026. In a best-case scenario, these cryptocurrencies could absolutely soar in value next year, driven by strong underlying fundamentals.\n1. Bitcoin\nMy top pick is Bitcoin (BTC +2.77%), which continues to be the market bellwether. As Bitcoin goes, so goes the rest of the crypto market. That's because Bitcoin still accounts for a whopping 60% of the value of the entire crypto market.\nCRYPTO: BTC\nKey Data Points\nThere's plenty to like about Bitcoin heading into 2026. For one, the pace of institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to build. It's not just big institutional investors that are allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Corporations are now adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, led by Bitcoin treasury companies that are scooping up the world's top cryptocurrency as fast as they can.\nEven better, the U.S. government has also embraced Bitcoin. 2025 saw the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and I'm convinced that things could accelerate even faster in 2026. The Trump administration has hinted over and over again that it is keeping a close eye on the price of Bitcoin, given its new status as a \"strategic asset.\"\nIf the price of Bitcoin begins to weaken next year, I'm convinced that the Treasury Department will find a \"budget-neutral\" way to load up on Bitcoin that doesn't involve taxpayer dollars. If sovereign nations around the world follow suit, that could lead to a major uptick in the price of Bitcoin.\n2. Ethereum\nWhat makes Ethereum (ETH +3.63%) so attractive as a potential investment target in 2026 is its highly diversified blockchain ecosystem. I've always viewed Ethereum as a sort of crypto conglomerate that has its hands in every important niche of the blockchain and crypto world.\nArguably, the most important of these niches is decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum remains a powerhouse in this area, and stands head and shoulders above other Layer-1 blockchain networks as the preferred blockchain of Wall Street.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nIn 2026, if Wall Street banks are going to embrace blockchain technology, then they are likely to embrace Ethereum as well. With that in mind, two major fintech trends could help to give Ethereum a major lift next year.\nOne of these is the extraordinary growth in stablecoins. These are digital currencies that are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. As such, they are really just \"digital dollars\" that can be deployed across various blockchains and different DeFi protocols.\nThe other major trend is real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This refers to the transformation of real-world assets such as stocks and bonds into digital assets that live on the blockchain. This is potentially a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity, and Ethereum stands out as the one blockchain where these digital assets are going to be actively managed and traded.\n3. Bittensor\nMy final pick is Bittensor (TAO +2.71%), which became the highest market cap AI coin in 2025. Plain and simple, an investment in Bittensor is a bet on the intersection of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence.\nNote that I've used the word \"bet\" here. That's exactly what it is. Bittensor is down 50% in 2025, and it's not a slam dunk by any means that it will continue to be the top AI coin in 2026.\nHowever, there's one feature of Bittensor that has my attention: a maximum lifetime supply of 21 million coins. Long-time crypto investors will immediately recognize the significance of that number: It's the exact same lifetime coin supply as that of Bitcoin.\nThus, if you buy into the scarcity argument as a big reason to invest in Bitcoin, then you need to buy into the same argument for Bittensor. By way of comparison, other top AI coins have supplies that "

(NYSE American: BMNR) heads into the final week of the year as one of the market\u2019s most polarizing \u201ccrypto-treasury\u201d equities\u2014trading less like a traditional operating company and more like a high-beta proxy for Ethereum. With U.S. stock markets closed for the weekend, investors are parsing a fresh wave of headlines tied to Ethereum staking activity, valuation models, and institutional positioning\u2014while also keeping an eye on a holiday-thin tape that can amplify Monday\u2019s opening moves.\nBMNR last traded at $28.31 at Friday\u2019s close, down about 3.6% on the session, with heavy volume relative to many small- and mid-cap names. [1]\nMeanwhile, crypto markets trade 24/7. Ethereum is hovering around $2,935 as of Sunday evening in New York, a level that matters for BMNR because the company\u2019s stated strategy has evolved into a large Ethereum-treasury play.\nWhy BMNR matters right now: the \u201cEthereum treasury\u201d trade meets staking\nBMNR\u2019s current narrative is anchored to one big idea: Bitmine has positioned itself as a major holder of ETH, and its valuation can swing sharply with Ethereum price moves, crypto sentiment, and the market\u2019s willingness to pay a premium\u2014or apply a discount\u2014to a corporate ETH balance sheet.\nIn its definitive proxy materials, the company\u2019s chairman, Thomas J. Lee, CFA, described 2025 as a \u201chistoric year\u201d in Bitmine\u2019s transformation into an \u201cETH and BTC Treasury Company,\u201d and disclosed crypto holdings that included millions of ETH along with bitcoin and cash. [2]\nThat framing matters because the last 48 hours brought a key development: reports that Bitmine-linked wallets began staking ETH\u2014moving from passive accumulation toward yield generation.\nThe BMNR news flow in the last 24\u201348 hours\n1) Reported ETH staking activity draws investor attention\nOver the weekend, Cointelegraph reported that wallets linked to Bitmine sent large ETH transfers to an Ethereum contract labeled \u201cBatchDeposit,\u201d citing on-chain data from Arkham and commentary from the on-chain analyst known as EmberCN. The report described transfers totaling 74,880 ETH\u2014roughly $219 million\u2014characterizing it as Bitmine\u2019s first move into staking. [3]\nIf Bitmine were to stake more of its holdings over time, the math can become meaningful quickly\u2014but it is highly assumption-dependent. Cointelegraph cited an estimated ~3.12% staking APY and a hypothetical scenario where staking a much larger ETH balance could generate substantial annual rewards. [4]\nWhat investors should keep in mind: this is not the same as an SEC-filed earnings forecast. It\u2019s an extrapolation based on staking yields and on-chain movements. Until Bitmine formally updates investors through a press release or SEC filing, the market is effectively trading the \u201cstory\u201d alongside the blockchain data.\n2) InvestingPro valuation call revisited after BMNR\u2019s big slide\nInvesting.com revisited BMNR\u2019s 2025 drawdown in a piece dated Dec. 27, focusing on an InvestingPro Fair Value model that previously flagged the stock as overvalued when it traded at $54.21\u2014estimating a Fair Value of $28.84. The article noted BMNR\u2019s subsequent decline into the high-$20s, broadly aligning with that downside estimate. [5]\nFor Monday, that sets up a key tension: if the stock is now near where some models consider \u201cfair,\u201d incremental upside may depend more on new catalysts\u2014ETH price strength, confirmation of staking economics, and capital-markets decisions\u2014than on a simple mean reversion narrative.\n3) Institutional ownership headlines surface via filings-based coverage\nOn Dec. 28, MarketBeat highlighted a Voya Investment Management position disclosed via SEC filing data\u201444,813 shares reported for Q3\u2014along with other institutions that have taken positions.

Ethereum followed far behind with approximately $524 million, highlighting a clear shift in where on-chain economic activity concentrated this year.\nThis milestone marks a major validation of Solana\u2019s high-throughput architecture and low-fee design, which continue to attract traders, developers, and power users even during periods of broader market volatility.\nDeFi and Memecoins Fuel Explosive Growth\nSolana\u2019s revenue surge stems largely from intense activity in decentralized finance and memecoin trading. The network processed massive transaction volumes while maintaining low costs, enabling rapid-fire trading that generated consistent fee income. In 2025 alone, Solana supported nearly 39.8 million active addresses and maintained roughly $17.3 billion in total value locked across its DeFi ecosystem.\nThis performance gave Solana its third consecutive quarter as the revenue leader among major blockchains, signaling sustained momentum rather than a short-lived spike.\nStrong Fundamentals, Mixed Market Reaction\nDespite Solana\u2019s dominant network earnings, community discussions highlight a growing disconnect between protocol performance and SOL\u2019s token price. While the blockchain posts record revenue and usage metrics, SOL price action has remained relatively muted compared to expectations.\nThis contrast has reignited debates within the ecosystem around value capture. Community members increasingly call for mechanisms such as fee burns, validator incentives, or revenue redistribution models that could translate network success more directly into tokenholder benefits. Solana\u2019s 2025 revenue leadership positions the network as a serious long-term contender in the Layer-1 race. As usage continues to scale, the next phase may hinge not on attracting activity\u2014but on aligning economic incentives so that network growth and token value move in tandem.\nReferences\nFollow us on Google News\nGet the latest crypto insights and updates.\nRelated Posts\nXRP Community Spots \u201c589\u201d Signal in Times Square New Year\u2019s Display\nTriparna Baishnab\nAuthor\nPi Network Academy Pushes Back Against GCV Narratives, Urges Pioneers to Trust Official Sources\nTriparna Baishnab\nAuthor\nWhy OKB Outshines Litecoin as a $1 Million Crypto Bet, According to On-Chain Data\nTriparna Baishnab\nAuthor"

                "body": "TLDR:\n- Ethereum currently hosts most stablecoins and core economic activity in the blockchain ecosystem.\n- Solana excels in high-frequency trading due to its optimization for low-cost transactions.\n- A single blockchain cannot scale to meet growing demand for tokenization and on-chain activity.\n- Dragonfly projects tenfold growth in stablecoins and prediction markets over the coming years.\nDragonfly general partner Rob Hadick stated that Ethereum and Solana will develop in parallel across different use cases during a December 24 interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box.\nHe compared the two blockchain networks to \u201ctwo Facebooks\u201d rather than competitors destined for a winner-take-all outcome.\nHadick explained that a single blockchain cannot support the entire ecosystem as asset tokenization accelerates and on-chain economic activity expands.\nThe veteran investor noted that Ethereum currently hosts most stablecoins and core economic activity, while Solana excels in high-frequency trading and transaction efficiency.\nParallel Development Across Different Use Cases\nHadick\u2019s assessment challenges the common narrative of blockchain competition. He explained that both networks serve distinct purposes within the broader crypto ecosystem.\nEthereum maintains its position as the primary hub for stablecoins and fundamental economic operations. The network\u2019s established infrastructure continues to attract projects requiring robust security and widespread adoption.\nMeanwhile, Solana has carved out a niche in areas requiring rapid transaction processing. The network\u2019s optimization for low-cost transactions gives it an edge in high-frequency trading applications.\nThis technical advantage has translated into higher trading volumes compared to Ethereum, even though Ethereum retains more total value locked.\nThe Dragonfly partner emphasized that the expanding demand for blockchain services will require multiple networks.\nAs tokenization of traditional assets gains momentum, different platforms will specialize in specific functions. This diversification reflects the natural evolution of technology markets rather than fragmentation.\nPositive Outlook Driven by Stablecoins and Tokenization\nDragonfly\u2019s investment strategy reflects confidence in the broader crypto market\u2019s future. Hadick expressed a constructive outlook for 2026, citing improved macroeconomic conditions and increased adoption.\nThe firm invests across the entire crypto ecosystem without ideological preferences for specific tokens. This approach allows them to capitalize on innovation throughout financial markets.\nHadick recommended stablecoins and prediction markets as particularly promising areas. He projects tenfold growth in both sectors over the coming years.\nMcKinsey research supports this view, showing substantial increases in cross-border payments using stablecoins. The growing acceptance of these digital assets by traditional finance suggests continued expansion.\nThe conversation also touched on emerging competitors in the blockchain space. Hadick acknowledged that new networks like Monad are entering the market to challenge established players.\nHowever, he maintained that both Ethereum and Solana will survive and flourish. The crypto veteran compared Bitcoin\u2019s two-year returns favorably to traditional markets, noting that Bitcoin has doubled while NASDAQ gained 50%.\nHe also referenced ICE\u2019s Jeff Sprecher\u2019s vision of tokenizing all markets, potentially creating an industry as large as ICE itself. This long-term perspective informs Dragonfly\u2019s investment philosophy across multiple blockchain platforms."

                "body": "A U.S. federal court has stepped into a growing dispute over fairness in the Solana memecoin market, drawing sharp attention to Pump.fun. The platform, known for rapid and open token launches, now sits at the center of a class-action lawsuit focused on transaction ordering and MEV tools.\nSignificantly, the court recently allowed thousands of internal messages from a whistleblower into the record, signaling that the claims warrant serious examination. While the ruling does not establish wrongdoing, it pushes the case beyond speculation and into formal legal scrutiny, with potential consequences for the wider crypto ecosystem.\nHow MEV Shifted the Fair Launch Debate\nPump.fun built its reputation on equal access. It removed presales, private rounds, and early allocations, creating confidence among retail traders. However, the lawsuit argues that fairness at the interface level does not ensure fairness in execution.\nBlockchains process transactions through validators, mempools, and priority fees, not simple button clicks. Consequently, traders with faster infrastructure and MEV bots can reach the front of blocks, even during public launches.\nAdditionally, newly launched tokens on Pump.fun start with thin liquidity and sharp bonding curves. Early execution can dramatically change prices within seconds.\nPlaintiffs claim that sophisticated traders exploited this structure by securing priority ordering, buying at lower prices, and exiting quickly. Retail users, meanwhile, often entered later at inflated levels, believing they remained early participants.\nWhy the Case Targets More Than Pump.fun\nThe lawsuit expands beyond Pump.fun to include Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, and Jito Labs. Plaintiffs argue that MEV advantages arise from infrastructure decisions, not just application design.\nValidators determine transaction order, while MEV tools optimize execution speed. Hence, responsibility may extend to entities that build and promote these systems.\nJito Labs receives particular attention due to its role in MEV optimization on Solana. Moreover, Solana\u2019s core organizations face scrutiny for promoting ecosystem growth while allegedly knowing about structural disadvantages facing retail users. If proven, this could reshape how blockchains communicate risk and fairness to users.\nBroader Implications for Retail Trust\nThe lawsuit cites estimated retail losses between $4.4 billion and $5.5 billion, though courts have not verified these figures. Still, the scale underscores rising concern about systemic inequality in crypto markets. Significantly, the case challenges whether public access alone defines fairness."

The broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), however, is trading down 0.3% premarket.\nMeanwhile, trade negotiations with China are on the rocks once again.

                "body": "NEW YORK, December 28, 2025, 21:01 ET \u2014 Market closed\n- Goldman Sachs shares closed down 0.4% on Friday in quiet post-holiday trading.\n- Investors head into the final year-end sessions with Fed minutes due Dec. 30 and trading volumes still thin.\n- Goldman is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15, the company said.\nGoldman Sachs shares slipped 0.4% to $907.04 at Friday\u2019s close as U.S. markets eased in a subdued, post-Christmas session.\nWhy this matters now is simple: with the cash market shut for the weekend, investors are heading into the last few sessions of the year with fewer catalysts and lighter participation. Low turnover can make even modest rebalancing flows show up more clearly in big, liquid bank stocks. [1]\nThe next scheduled macro event lands early in the week. The Federal Reserve is set to release minutes from its Dec. 9-10 meeting on Dec. 30, a detailed account that investors use to gauge how unified policymakers were on the rate outlook. [2]\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 fell 2.11 points to 6,929.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 20.19 points in what the Associated Press described as a quiet, low-volume session after the holiday. [3]\nFinancials moved with the broader tape. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund dipped 0.2%, while JPMorgan Chase fell 0.4%, Bank of America eased 0.1% and Morgan Stanley edged up 0.1%.\nGoldman traded between about $904 and $913 on Friday, with just under 1 million shares in volume.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just simply catching our breath today after the holiday,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. [4]\nThe rate backdrop remains central for banks. The Fed funds target range stands at 3.50% to 3.75%, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-rate data. [5]\nThose expectations can matter for bank stocks because they influence the outlook for net interest income \u2014 the spread between what banks earn on loans and pay on deposits \u2014 and can shift risk appetite for underwriting and trading.\nFor Goldman, the next company catalyst is earnings. The bank said it will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, Jan. 15, with results expected around 7:30 a.m. ET and a conference call at 9:30 a.m. ET. [6]\nBefore the next session, traders will be watching whether year-end positioning keeps volumes light and price action choppy in financials, particularly in large-cap names that often get used for quick risk adjustments. [7]\nOn charts, the $900 level is a clear round-number marker for Goldman, with Friday\u2019s low near $904 and resistance around $913, the session\u2019s high.\nAfter the minutes on Dec. 30, the Fed\u2019s calendar shows its next policy meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27-28. [8]\nSome investors also track the so-called \u201cSanta Claus rally,\u201d the seasonal stretch covering the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the next, for an early read on January sentiment.

UnitedHealth Group (up 24.2%)\nUnitedHealth took a tumble with a weak earnings report at the end of July, but bounced back in August. The stock soared on Aug. 15, as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a brand-new position of 5 million shares in the stock. The $3.3 billion merger with home health specialist Amedisys was completed on the same day, adding fuel to the fires.

The four-year commitment of an additional $100 billion includes partnerships with Texas Instruments and Corning.\nAdvertisement\n3. American Express (up 10.7%)\nCredit services giant American Express (NYSE: AXP) sprinted higher by landing several valuable sporting sponsorships in the Miami area. The deals include the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Dolphins football team.\n4. Home Depot (up 10.7%)\nHome improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE: HD) reported modest Q2 results last month. The stock still rose; management said that consumers are just delaying their big-ticket home improvement projects. The financial results should improve over time.\n5. Sherwin-Williams (up 10.6%)\nPaint retailer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) followed the same themes as Home Depot.

[4]\nThe weekend setup: Wall Street near highs, metals on the move\nWhile the LSE was closed, U.S. markets wrapped up a post-Christmas Friday session that was nearly flat\u2014more \u201ccatching our breath\u201d than \u201cnew trend unlocked.\u201d Reuters reported the S&P 500 finished at 6,929.94, with the Dow and Nasdaq also edging slightly lower on the day, as investors watched for signs of a \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d and weighed year-end positioning. [5]\nAt the same time, Reuters\u2019 global markets report underscored the other major cross-asset storyline: gold and silver surged to fresh records, supported by expectations for Fed rate cuts and safe-haven demand\u2014moves that can matter disproportionately for London because of the FTSE\u2019s resource-heavy composition. [6]\nThat combination\u2014Wall Street steady-to-firm, and commodities (especially precious metals) behaving like they\u2019ve had three espressos\u2014sets up Monday as a potentially lively catch-up session for London-listed miners and diversified commodity names.\nTrading hours and what \u201cMonday\u2019s reopen\u201d actually means\nFor readers tracking the London session from New York: London Stock Exchange trading hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. London time. [7]\nLate December can also include irregular schedules. LSE listings face an upcoming year-end half-day: the exchange\u2019s business-day guidance indicates Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025 is a New Year\u2019s holiday half-day, with the market closing process beginning around 12:30 p.m. London time. [8]\nForecasts and market strategy: 2026 optimism, with caveats\nInvestor mood going into the final trading days of 2025 has leaned upbeat\u2014especially in the U.S., where the S&P 500 is near the psychologically important 7,000 threshold. In Reuters\u2019 \u201cWeek Ahead\u201d preview, Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, said momentum favored bulls, while also noting the market\u2019s sensitivity to shocks. [9]\nThe same Reuters piece flagged the next set of catalysts that global equity desks will be juggling\u2014particularly Federal Reserve meeting minutes and the ever-present question of the path for rates in 2026. Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, told Reuters the minutes could be useful in understanding the debate inside the Fed. [10]\nFor London investors, these U.S. signals matter because they influence global risk appetite, the dollar, and bond yields\u2014variables that can quickly ripple into UK financials, multinationals, and commodity-linked shares.\nOn the calendar, Investopedia highlighted a ho"

                "body": "Hang Seng Index jumped 30% in 2025: here are the top gainers\nThe Hang Seng Index had a good performance in 2025 as it jumped by 30%, outperforming other top global indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and the Nasdaq 100 Index. It was trading at $25,935 on Monday, up by ~40% from its lowest level in April. This article explores some of the top reasons behind the rally and the top gainers.\nWhy the Hang Seng Index soared in 2025\nThe Hang Seng Index, which tracks the biggest companies in China, did well in 2025. First, the rally was because of the ongoing performance in the global equities market, with most indices being in the green. This includes popular indices like the German DAX, the Nasdaq 100, and the TSX Composite.\nSecond, the index jumped after Donald Trump announced a trade deal with China in his bid to secure rare earth materials. He slashed tariffs from over 100% to the current 15%.\nAdditionally, the index benefited from the artificial intelligence trade experienced this year. That is important as the index is made up of some of the biggest companies in the AI industry, like Tencent and Alibaba.\nThe Chinese economy continued doing well, with analysts expecting it to hit the important milestone of 5%. One sign that this will happen is the soaring copper price, which hit a record high of $13,000. Copper is widely seen as the barometer for the global economy.\nTop gainers in the Hang Seng in 2025\nMost companies in the Hang Seng Index did well this year. China Hongqiao Group stock jumped by 181% this year and was the best-performing company in the index. This increase brought its ten-year gains to over 653% as demand for aluminium continued soaring. This is notable as it is one of the biggest players in the aluminium index.\nZijin Mining Group stock price jumped by 154% this year as the copper and gold prices continued their bull run. Gold more than doubled and moved above the key resistance level at $4,50. Silver price is nearing $80, while other metals it mines continue rising.\nSMIC, one of the biggest chip manufacturing companies in China, soared by 126% this year as the artificial intelligence boom accelerated. It has jumped by over 800% in the last decade.\nMeanwhile, the Pop Mart stock price jumped by 126%, helped by the ongoing labubu craze. However, the stock has plunged by 22% in the last three months as concerns about its demand remained.\nThe other top gainers in the Hang Seng Index were companies like Innovent Biologics, Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, JD Health, and Sino Biopharmaceutical Group.\nSome key companies in the index did well. For example, Alibaba jumped by over 78% as the company\u2019s turnaround strategy accelerated. HSBC stock soared because of the ongoing boom in the banking sector, and as its turnaround continued. Hang Seng Bank also jumped after being acquired by HSBC.\nThere were some notable laggards in the Hang Seng Index this year. Meituan\u2019s stock price plunged by 30% this year as the price war with Alibaba and JD accelerated. Li Auto and BYD stocks dropped by double digits as concerns about the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) remained.\nInvestors are concerned that these companies will see waning demand after many Chinese provinces started to end the subsidies. As such, market participants worry that the companies will see slow growth during the year.\nThe other top laggards in the Hang Seng Index were Zhongsheng Group, JD.com, New Oriental, China Mengniu Dairy, Longfor Group, and JD Logistics.\nREAD MORE: Top reasons why the Hang Seng Index may surge in 2025"

                "body": "December 29: Florence Gaub\u2019s Zukunft fuels foresight investing\nFlorence Gaub is inspiring German investors to think ahead. Her bestseller Zukunft, praised by a German review, argues that we can shape outcomes with clear, science-based thinking. As the year ends, we can turn that message into action. We link futures thinking to portfolios, investor sentiment, and scenario planning for 2025. We show how to set simple routines, test assumptions, and build risk buffers in euro terms. This is foresight investing done in plain language.\nHow foresight investing turns ideas into action\nThe review of Zukunft stresses that we are not stuck with a fixed fate. That aligns with how we invest. We choose exposure, time horizon, and buffers. Florence Gaub reminds us to focus on choices, not headlines. For investors in Germany, that means written plans beat hunches. See the German review for context and method emphasis source.\nWe start with a driver, like energy prices or EU policy. Then we sketch two or three realistic paths and note portfolio impacts. Florence Gaub\u2019s focus on structured thinking helps us turn vague risks into clear options. We set triggers for adds, trims, or hedges. The review\u2019s framing of Zuk\u00fcnfte supports this plural view of the future source.\nTools German investors can use before year-end\nMany German savers own broad ETFs and DAX funds. We can test scenarios like slower global growth, stronger euro, or higher ECB rates. For each path, we note effects on exporters, banks, and utilities. This is simple to write and quick to review. Florence Gaub\u2019s message helps us keep it practical and calm.\nWe match cash needs to time. Bills within one year sit in cash-like vehicles. Goals in three to five years get balanced funds. Long-term targets use broad equity exposure. We size each bucket in euros, not guesses. This turns worry into steps. With florence gaub in mind, we protect agency by spacing risks over time.\nInvestor sentiment and discipline in 2025 positioning\nWhen markets rise, we often chase. When they fall, we freeze. A futures mindset asks what could happen next and what we would do. We write that plan before emotions spike. Florence Gaub\u2019s approach to choices over fate helps us keep rules simple, repeatable, and ready for the next shift.\nWe track a short list: euro moves, ECB tone, wage growth, and power prices. We add earnings guidance from major European firms and watch cost of credit. We cut the noise. With florence gaub as inspiration, we pick signals we can explain at the kitchen table, then link them to clear portfolio actions.\nA practical monthly workflow for foresight investing\nOnce a month, we run a one-hour review. Fifteen minutes to update data, 20 minutes to refresh scenarios, 15 minutes to check positions, 10 minutes to note actions. If we invest as a family, one person leads notes, another challenges assumptions. Florence Gaub\u2019s focus on structure supports this short, steady routine.\nWe pre-write add, hold, and reduce rules for each holding. We keep a small watchlist with entry ranges and reasons. We set exit triggers tied to facts, not fear. We record each move and review results. Refer back to the German review of Zukunft to keep the method grounded source.\nFinal Thoughts\nForesight investing turns vague worry into simple, written steps. We define two or three plausible paths, note effects on our holdings, and assign clear triggers. We size cash, balanced, and equity buckets in euros that match our goals. We keep a tight dashboard of signals we can explain to our family. Inspired by florence gaub, we choose action over fate and discipline over noise. For 2025, set a monthly one-hour review, update scenarios, and make small, repeatable adjustments. This steady process helps German investors stay calm, protect downside, and capture upside without guesswork.\nFAQs\nFlorence Gaub is a strategic foresight expert and Spiegel-bestselling author of Zukunft. Her core idea is that the future is shaped by choices, not f"

                "body": "NEW YORK, December 28, 2025, 8:33 a.m. ET, Market closed \u2014 Frankfurt\u2019s stock market is off the tape this weekend, but the next open could pack more punch than the calendar suggests. With the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) and its flagship electronic venue Xetra heading into the final stretch of 2025, investors are staring at a familiar year-end cocktail: thin liquidity, compressed trading schedules, and an outsized sensitivity to U.S. rate expectations.\nGermany\u2019s blue-chip DAX last closed at 24,340.06 on December 23 (before the Christmas shutdown), within sight of its 52-week high of 24,771.34\u2014a reminder that European equities have been finishing 2025 with their own momentum, even as trading days disappear. [1]\nWhere the Frankfurt Stock Exchange stands heading into Monday\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange is best understood as a \u201cmarket ecosystem\u201d rather than a single screen. Xetra is the main electronic order book for German equities, while Frankfurt trading also runs longer hours for many instruments. Official Deutsche B\u00f6rse guidance lists Xetra trading from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CET (Monday\u2013Friday), with Frankfurt trading \u201cin general\u201d from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. CET for many products (bonds are shorter). [2]\nFor U.S.-based readers tracking this from New York, wintertime clocks typically put Xetra\u2019s core session in the early morning through late morning ET\u2014a scheduling detail that matters when macro headlines hit before the European open.\nJust as important: the calendar.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s published year-end schedule shows Germany\u2019s cash market was closed December 24\u201326, returns for a shortened session on December 30 (until 2:00 p.m. CET), and is closed on December 31 and January 1, 2026. [3]\nThat means the next Frankfurt session (Monday) arrives in a market that\u2019s had time to \u201cmarinate\u201d in global news without local price discovery\u2014often a recipe for gap moves at the open.\nThe last 48 hours: the global headlines Frankfurt traders are waking up to\nBecause Germany\u2019s cash equity market has been shut for the holiday stretch and weekend, the most market-moving developments over the past two days have been largely U.S.-driven\u2014and those signals frequently set the tone for Europe\u2019s first prints when trading resumes.\nHere\u2019s what dominated the last 24\u201348 hours in market coverage:\n1) Wall Street stayed near record levels, but the action was thin.\nReuters\u2019 week-ahead outlook noted major U.S. indexes sitting at record peaks, with the S&P 500 about 1% from 7,000, and highlighted that light volumes can exaggerate moves into year-end. [4]\nAP likewise described quiet post-Christmas trading on Friday, with major indexes finishing slightly lower amid below-average volume. [5]\n2) The Fed is back in the driver\u2019s seat next week.\nReuters flagged upcoming Federal Reserve minutes as a key near-term catalyst, with investors focused on the path of further cuts after 2025\u2019s rate reductions. In that same report, Murphy & Sylvest\u2019s Paul Nolte said equity momentum still favored bulls absent an \u201cexogenous event,\u201d while Michael Reynolds of Glenmede pointed to the minutes as potentially illuminating for the policy debate. [6]\nFor Frankfurt, that matters because the \u201crates narrative\u201d tends to translate quickly into European financials, cyclicals, and euro sensitivity.\n3) Markets are watching rotation, not just direction.\nReuters also emphasized market rotation\u2014strength outside big tech\u2014and quoted Anthony Saglimbene (Ameriprise) on investors increasingly buying into the idea that the economy has been \u201con pretty solid footing.\u201d [7]\nThat\u2019s relevant for the DAX, which is heavily tilted toward industrials, chemicals, and global exporters\u2014sectors that can benefit when broadening participation reduces the market\u2019s dependence on a narrow tech leadership cohort.\n4) Commodities made noise: precious metals surged while oil fell.\nAP reported silver jumping sharply and gold rising, while crude prices slid.

There are no extreme readings from longer-term breadth indicators, such as the percentage of stocks trading above their 50- and 200-month moving averages.\nWhile weekly price action has become increasingly choppy and hints at the development of an ABC-style correction, there is little evidence to suggest a major secular top is forming in the absence of a genuine black swan event.\nUltimately, I expect dips to continue to be bought through 2026, allowing the broader bullish trend to reassert itself and push to new highs by year end.\nThat said, the Nasdaq 100 may already be entering \u2014 or be close to entering \u2014 a more meaningful corrective phase.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson, Source: TradingView, Nasdaq\n10\u201320% Retracement Risk: What History Suggests\nThe lower indicator shows the percentage drawdown from the prior 12-month high, helping to distinguish major sell-offs from more routine corrections while also highlighting their frequency. Unsurprisingly, the largest declines occurred during the dot-com bust, but the focus here is on smaller pullbacks, which are statistically far more common.\nSince 2003, the vast majority of Nasdaq corrections have been less than 10%. Only thirteen have exceeded 10%, and just two extended beyond 20%. Barring a major shock, this suggests any pullback in 2026 is more likely to fall in the 5\u201310% range, with a smaller risk of a deeper 10\u201320% correction.\nNasdaq 100 Technical Analysis: Key Correction Levels\nThe weekly chart suggests an ABC-style correction may already be underway. Retracement levels have been plotted using December\u2019s current high as the assumed year-to-date peak, helping identify areas where any pullback could stall.\nNotably, the February high aligns closely with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, sitting just below the 10% drawdown zone. This places the ~22,300 area as a plausible near-term target for bears, or a zone where bulls may look to buy dips later in the year.\nIn the event of a sharper sell-off, a deeper correction of around 20% would bring prices towards the 50\u201361.8% Fibonacci retracement zone, cluster"

[4]\nThe bigger-picture backdrop remains supportive for the tech trade: the S&P 500 is hovering near record territory and has been within striking distance of 7,000, while the Nasdaq Composite is up about 22% year-to-date\u2014an outcome that reinforces how central technology and AI themes have been to 2025\u2019s equity performance. [5]\nThe key crosscurrent: rotation away from tech, not a tech collapse\nA crucial nuance for investors heading into Monday is that \u201ctechnology stocks\u201d aren\u2019t moving as one block.\nIn recent weeks, the S&P 500 tech sector has lagged other areas of the market\u2014down more than 3% since early November\u2014even as groups like financials, transports, healthcare, and small caps have shown better relative strength. Strategists have described this as rotation toward more moderate valuations and broader participation, rather than a definitive end to the multi-year tech-led bull run. [6]\nThat rotation matters for how investors approach \u201ctech stocks\u201d into year-end:\n- If breadth continues to improve, the Nasdaq can rise even with select megacaps consolidating.\n- If rate expectations shift abruptly, long-duration growth stocks could swing more sharply than the broader market.\n- If AI spending fears re-accelerate, semiconductors and hyperscaler-adjacent names may see the biggest reactions.\nHeadlines driving tech sentiment in the last 24\u201348 hours\nNvidia stays at the center of the AI hardware narrative\nNvidia remains the bellwether for AI-related risk appetite. In Friday\u2019s session, Nvidia shares gained after news tied to a licensing arrangement with AI chip startup Groq and an executive hire, keeping investors focused on competition\u2014and collaboration\u2014in AI compute. [7]\nOver the weekend, the AI trade also attracted high-profile skepticism. The Wall Street Journal reported that Michael Burry has been positioning against AI leaders including Nvidia and Palantir via put options, arguing parts of the AI complex show bubble-like behavior reminiscent of prior tech manias. [8]\nThe takeaway for tech-stock investors: Nvidia isn\u2019t just trading on quarterly fundamentals right now. It\u2019s also trading as a proxy for broader confidence in AI monetization timelines, capex discipline, and the durability of hyperscaler demand.\nAmazon: drone delivery plans in Italy halted\nAmazon, a heavyweight in many \u201ctechnology stocks\u201d baskets and broad-market indexes, added a fresh corporate headline Sunday. Reuters reported that Amazon will no longer pursue its commercial drone delivery plans in Italy following a strategic review, citing the broader business and regulatory environment.

                "body": "By Ankur Banerjee\nSINGAPORE, Dec 29 (Reuters) \u2013 Asian stocks were at six-week highs on Monday, while the dollar hovered near its lowest in almost three months on expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next year, which have also sparked a fierce rally in precious metals.\nSilver climbed above the $80-per-ounce-mark for the first time before sliding sharply lower in volatile trading on Monday, while platinum and palladium also fell sharply after hitting all-time highs. Gold eased nearly 1% but has repeatedly breached record highs this year on dollar weakness, safe-haven demand and rate cut wagers.\nCharu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said precious metals have been lifted this year by a powerful mix of rate-cut tailwinds and hedging against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.\n\u201cAdd supply worries and the move has turned parabolic. But the late-year, near-vertical surge, especially in silver, also raises the risk of higher volatility. Near-term, the risk is technical and positioning-led.\u201d\n\u201cThe big picture, however, for precious metals still looks structurally supportive with easier rates ahead, fiscal and geopolitical unease, and ongoing diversification demand. That means any pullbacks may be seen as opportunities for long-term investors to rebuild exposure,\u201d Chanana said.\nGeopolitics was back on investors\u2019 minds after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were \u201cgetting a lot closer, maybe very close\u201d to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.\nSTRONG YEAR-END FOR STOCKS\nIn stocks, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares was 0.27% higher, hitting its highest since October 3 in a strong start to the last week of the year. The index has risen over 25% this year, boosted by technology stocks as AI mania firmly took hold of investors.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 1.5% to a near two-month peak, taking its yearly gains to an eye-popping 74%, on pace for its strongest annual gain since 1999. Japan\u2019s Nikkei slipped 0.4%, while Taiwan stocks rose 0.3% to a record high.\nInvestor focus on the holiday-curtailed week will be on minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting due on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank cut rates earlier this month and projected just one more cut for next year while traders have priced in at least two more.\nTony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, said markets will scour the minutes for deeper insights into the committee debates on the balance of risks and the timing of future easing.\nThe spotlight will then switch over to labour market data expected in the new year including non-farm payrolls, Sycamore said.\n\u201cIf these reports show unambiguous labour market weakness, it will increase the likelihood that the Fed cuts rates by 25bp at its January FOMC meeting.\u201d\nFRAIL YEN FINDS SUPPORT\nThe Japanese yen firmed 0.2% to 156.13 per U.S. dollar after a slightly hawkish summary of opinions from the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy meeting in December showed on Monday. The summary showed many board members seeing the need for further increases to the BOJ\u2019s policy rate.\nThe BOJ hiked interest rates earlier this month in a well-telegraphed move but markets were left disappointed by the comments afterwards that suggested the central bank was in no rush to hike again. That weighed on the yen and raised intervention worries among traders as officials in Tokyo sent strong verbal warnings last week.\nStill, the yen remains close to the 10-month low of 157.9 per U.S. dollar it hit in November and the risk of intervention lurks as investors cut their long yen positions.\nThe prospect of the Fed cutting rates next year has kept the dollar under pressure, while the spectre of a new Fed Chair that may be dovish and willing to lower rates looms large.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was 0.08% lower at 97.953, on track for a 9.7% drop for the year, its steepest since 2017.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Sam Holmes)"
