                "body": "Gold Eases From Record High on Profit Taking; Silver Sets New Peak\nGold markets have been full of excitement lately. After riding a huge rally and reaching fresh all\u2011time highs, Gold prices eased back as investors decided to lock in profits. At the same time, silver continued to make waves by setting new peak levels.\nGold Market Update\n- Record High Reached: Gold hit $4,500 per ounce in recent trading. Strong investor demand for safety drove this peak.\n- Profit Taking: Investors sold some holdings after large gains, causing a short-term dip. This is normal after big rallies.\n- Yearly Gain: Gold\u2019s price is up roughly 70% in 2025, reflecting market trends and interest in safe-haven assets.\n- Influencing Factors: Gains are boosted by expectations of U.S. rate cuts in 2026, macroeconomic uncertainty, central bank buying, and a weaker U.S. dollar.\n- Market Outlook: Short-term pullbacks don\u2019t indicate a crash. Gold remains strong as investors continue seeking security amid global uncertainty.\nSilver\u2019s New Peak\n- Record Levels: Silver continues to rise while Gold eased. Prices hit all-time peaks in multiple markets. In India, silver crossed historic price levels per kilogram for the first time.\n- Rally Drivers: The surge is fueled by investment demand and industrial use. Silver is key in tech, renewable energy, EVs, and data centers, fast-growing sectors.\n- Performance vs Gold: In 2025, silver jumped about 138% year-to-date, far outpacing Gold, which rose roughly 74.5%.\n- Market Impact: This strong move reflects tight supply, rising industrial demand, and high investor interest, pushing prices sharply higher.\nKey Factors Driving Recent Moves\n- Safe-Haven Demand: Gold and silver rise during uncertainty, like geopolitics and inflation.\n- Interest Rates: Expected Fed rate cuts in 2026 make Gold more attractive.\n- Dollar Influence: A weaker U.S. dollar boosts Gold prices.\n- Silver Demand: Industrial use in tech and clean energy drives silver prices.\nWhat This Means for Investors\nIf you\u2019re watching the Gold price and silver trends, here\u2019s what to keep in mind:\n- Gold is still strong: Even after easing, prices remain high. The long\u2011term trend is up unless macro conditions shift suddenly.\n- Silver\u2019s rally shows strength: Industrial demand gives silver extra legs to stand on. But high volatility means big swings are possible.\n- Diversification matters: Precious metals can help stabilize portfolios during uncertain times. Investors often use ETFs, bullion, or mining stocks to gain exposure.\n- Watch the news: Economic data, Fed signals, and geopolitical developments will keep moving these markets. Staying informed is key.\nConclusion\nGold has eased a bit from its record highs due to profit-taking and a firmer dollar. Yet the metal\u2019s broader trend remains strong as investors seek safety and hedge against uncertainty. Meanwhile, silver has marched ahead to new peaks, powered not only by investment demand but by real\u2011world industrial use. We believe the precious metals story in late 2025 highlights how markets balance fear, opportunity, and utility. Both gold and silver continue to matter for investors, even as they behave differently in the face of global forces. The key is to watch price trends closely and understand what\u2019s driving them, whether it\u2019s profit taking, rate expectations, or demand from industry.\nFAQS\nGold fell slightly due to profit-taking and a stronger U.S. dollar.\nSilver\u2019s surge is driven by industrial demand and tight supply, along with investor interest.\nLower interest rates make Gold more attractive compared to bonds and savings.\nNo, dips are usually temporary; Gold and Silver remain strong amid uncertainty.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational purposes.

The decline comes amid ongoing correction and profit-taking, alongside a recovery in the US currency ahead of the close of trading for 2025.\nThe downside in the single currency is being limited by fading expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates in February 2026, particularly as economic activity in the euro area has im"

                "source": "VT Markets",
                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/as-traders-secure-profits-gold-price-declines-after-reaching-a-near-4550-peak-amid-rising-dollar/",
                "body": "Gold prices declined during the early European session on Monday, following a record high near $4,550. Traders took profits before the holidays, causing a pullback despite a nearly 70% surge in 2025, marking its best performance since 1979.\nThe potential for US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026 could provide support, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold. Persistent geopolitical tensions may also support gold\u2019s appeal. The US Dollar\u2019s strength applies downward pressure on gold, increasing costs for non-US buyers.\nFinancial Markets Overview\nFinancial markets showed reduced activity ahead of the New Year. The US Pending Home Sales report for November was set to release later on Monday, while US Initial Jobless Claims declined to 214,000, exceeding forecasts.\nThe overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates caution for gold\u2019s near-term trajectory, despite maintaining strength above key technical levels. Immediate resistance stands at the $4,550 high, with support at the December 23 low of $4,430.\nGold remains a key investment during uncertain times and is a safeguard against inflation. Central banks, notably in China, India, and Turkey, have significantly increased gold reserves, with record purchases in 2022. Gold tends to rise when the US Dollar depreciates, maintaining its inverse relationship with various assets.\nWe are seeing some profit-taking in gold after it touched a record high near $4,550, which is natural given the thin trading volumes heading into the New Year. This slight pullback shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for a major reversal of the trend. The underlying reasons for its incredible 70% surge in 2025 are still firmly in place.\nExpectations for the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates into 2026 remain the primary driver for higher prices. With US inflation data throughout 2025 consistently running above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the appeal of gold as an inflation hedge is strong. Lower interest rates would also reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding metal.\nInvestment Strategies and Market Dynamics\nDespite the strong trend, we must acknowledge the overbought signals from technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This suggests the market is extended and could be vulnerable to a near-term correction before pushing higher. A drop towards support levels around $4,430 or even $4,338 would offer a better entry point for new long positions.\nFor those holding long futures positions, buying near-term put options could provide a cost-effective hedge against a sudden holiday-thinned market drop. Conversely, traders anticipating a continuation of the rally after this brief pause could look at buying call options with expirations in late January or February 2026. This allows us to participate in the upside while defining our risk.\nWe also see continued support from persistent geopolitical uncertainty, from the ongoing talks over Ukraine to other global hotspots that keep safe-haven demand elevated. Furthermore, data from the World Gold Council has confirmed that central banks continued their historic buying spree through 2025, absorbing supply and putting a floor under the price. These institutional flows are a powerful force that is unlikely to reverse course quickly."

Despite the potential tailwind from Chinese stimulus, crude is currently headed for a more than 20% decline this year\u2014its steepest annual drop since 2020.\nThe primary factor driving this sharp decline is the widespread expectation of a global oil supply surplus in the coming year, overshadowing near-term positive demand signals.\nOn the other hand, US crude oil stockpiles data for the week ending December 19 is highly anticipated by investors.\nA Reuters poll, which was extended, suggests a likely decline in US crude oil inventories for the past week, although both distillate and gasoline inventories are projected to have increased.\nDue to the Christmas holiday, the report\u2019s release was postponed from its typical Wednesday schedule last week."

                "body": "What's happening further down the Vaca Muerta shale oil production table?\nArgentina's Vaca Muerta shale play is typically associated with established oil heavyweights like YPF and Vista Energy \u2013 but smaller firms are looking to either gain a production toehold or grow their presence.\nYPF and Vista, along with five others, Pan American Energy (PAE), Pluspetrol, Shell, Tecpetrol and Chevron, account for around 90% of unconventional oil production, chiefly in Neuqu\u00e9n province.\nAround 10 others are working to tap Vaca Muerta resources, not just in Neuqu\u00e9n but also in R\u00edo Negro and Mendoza province, each sitting over a sliver of the formation.\nCompared with the billions of dollars of capex assigned by the big players, the smaller firms are typically planning smaller outlay, for exploration and development.\nA chief attraction of Vaca Muerta is the relatively low lifting costs achievable. In the conventional hydrocarbons segment, costs are typically higher and assets mature.\nMidstream infrastructure is also being built and the government has indicated that Rigi investment incentive regime benefits could be extended to include upstream hydrocarbons.\nUnconventional oil production in October registered at around 571,330b/d, according to data from local oil and gas institute IAPG.\nThe global oil price outlook for 2026 is not favorable for producers and could potentially impact investment decisions. US government energy data platform the US Energy Information Administration expects Brent to average US$55/b next year, down from an expected US$69/b in 2025.\nProducers will also be looking at long-term global demand trends amid the energy transition.\nGeoPark\nFor next year, Colombia-based GeoPark aims to deploy US$80mn-100mn at new acquired acreage Loma Jarillosa Este and Puesto Silva Oeste in Neuqu\u00e9n province, the company says in a work program.\nWork includes bringing a five-well pad into production, upgrading facilities and advancing permitting work for Puesto Silva Oeste.\nCompany output in Argentina is forecast to reach 20,000boe/d by end-2028, up from around 1,100boe/d.\nTanGo Energy\nPartly owned by Vista Energy, TanGo Energy has joined forces with PAE to invest US$36mn in the Loma Guadalosa area, in R\u00edo Negro province.\nThis falls under a provincial push to tap its sliver of the Vaca Muerta formation.\nFormerly Petrolera Aconcagua Energ\u00eda, TanGo also holds rights to Mendoza province acreage Pay\u00fan Oeste, seen holding unconventional and conventional potential. Outlay of US$8mn over 10 years is expected, local press reported.\nPampa Energ\u00eda\nTraditionally gas-focused, Pampa Energ\u00eda is investing to build a Vaca Muerta oil footprint, via acreage Rinc\u00f3n de Aranda in Neuqu\u00e9n province. The company has said it planned to spend US$750mn at the project in 2026, to reach a production plateau of 45,000b/d in 1Q27.\nKilwer (Phoenix Global Resources)\nThe flagship Vaca Muerta asset of Kilwer \u2013 a unit of British company Phoenix Global Resources \u2013 is Mata Mora Norte in Neuqu\u00e9n province.\nIn Neuqu\u00e9n, company output is around 13,000b/d and a treatment plant is being built.\nIn neighboring R\u00edo Negro, Phoenix was granted rights to Confluencia Norte and Confluencia Sur. Phoenix \u2013 which currently accounts for 30% of the province\u2019s output \u2013 has brought four wells into production in the Confluencia Sur area, pumping around 5,000b/d. Including production from Confluencia Norte, the company\u2019s total output in the jurisdiction is about 7,000b/d. Rights to the acreage were awarded in 2023. Overall outlay of around US$90mn is expected.\nLast half, Phoenix said Vaca Muerta investment would reach around US$2bn over the next five years.\nThe company goal is hitting a production plateau of 50,000-70,000b/d in 2026-27.\nCapex\nAnother Argentine minnow, Capex was awarded the rights to explore R\u00edo Negro acreage Cinco Saltos Norte.\nAssociated investment in US$6.85mn.\nWork includes reprocessing 200km2 of 3D seismic. Capex must form a consortium with provincial hydrocarbons firm Edhipsa.\nIf "

                "body": "Oil Stuck in Tug of War\nOil is stuck in a tug of war, Naeem Aslam, Chief Market Analyst at Zaye Capital Markets, said in a comment sent to Rigzone on Monday.\n\u201cGeopolitics are adding short term volatility and keeping prices supported, but persistent oversupply, rising inventories, and weakening demand signals are capping any real upside,\u201d Aslam said in the statement.\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s a major supply shock, crude is likely to stay range bound around the low $60s rather than break higher,\u201d Aslam added.\nA BofA Global Research report sent to Rigzone on December 18 noted that Brent broke below $60 per barrel that week \u201con news that China crude oil inventories continued to balloon during the past week, even though much of the oil is likely set to go into strategic storage\u201d.\n\u201cThe reality is that crude oil prices have been falling since OPEC+ announced a return of idle production in June 2024, as incremental volumes have exacerbated an already-sluggish market environment for crude oil,\u201d the BofA report stated.\n\u201cWhile near dated crude oil prices have come down significantly, long dated prices have only fallen by a few dollars,\u201d it added.\nThat report went on to state that \u201ca global projected surplus of two million barrels per day means that crude oil prices should average substantially less in 2026 than they did in 2025\u201d.\n\u201cHeading into next year, we remain only somewhat bearish on prices despite the large projected surplus, as we do not believe it is in OPEC\u2019s self-interest to drive Brent below $50 per barrel,\u201d the report noted.\nThe report went on to project that the Brent price will average about $60 per barrel next year \u201ccompared to almost $69 per barrel this year\u201d.\nIn a statement sent to Rigzone by the Enverus team on December 16, Enverus subsidiary Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR) projected that the Brent price will average $55 per barrel in 2026. According to the statement, EIR sees the Brent price rising from an average of $50 per barrel in the first half of next year to an average of $60 in the second half.\n\u201cEIR projects oil prices will weaken in 2026, with Brent crude expected to average $55 per barrel,\u201d EIR noted in that statement.\n\u201cNear term oil price pressure reflects global inventory levels approaching highs last seen during the pandemic and the shale price war,\u201d it added.\nEIR outlined in the statement that it \u201cadopts a bullish stance\u201d beyond 2026.\n\u201cOPEC-12 liquids output is near historic highs and could tap untested spare capacity in coming years, while long term oil demand projections have strengthened,\u201d EIR said in the statement.\n\u201cAt the same time, global oil and gas supply projects are declining due to underinvestment - setting the stage for tighter balances and higher prices later in the decade,\u201d it added.\nIn the statement, EIR Director Al Salazar said, \u201cour analysis shows that while short term pressures will weigh on oil and gas prices, both markets become supply short post 2026\u201d.\n\u201cThis should pave the way for renewed bullish momentum through the rest of the decade,\u201d he added.\nA report sent to Rigzone by the Macquarie team on December 5 showed that Macquarie was projecting that the Brent price will average $68.21 per barrel overall in 2025 and $60.75 per barrel overall in 2026.\nAccording to its December short term energy outlook (STEO), which was released on December 9, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) sees the Brent spot price averaging $68.91 per barrel this year and $55.08 per barrel next year. In its previous STEO, which was released in November, the EIA projected that the Brent spot price would average $68.76 per barrel in 2025 and $54.92 per barrel in 2026.\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com\nWhat do you think?

                "body": "Oil prices rebound over 2% on geopolitical fears, but global supply glut, Saudi cuts loom\nOil prices jumped on Monday on potential disruptions in oil supply from the Middle East.\nAt the time of writing, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was at $58 per barrel, up 2.2%, while Brent was 2% higher at $61.44 a barrel.\nBoth oil benchmarks had fallen more than 2% on Friday.\nGeopolitical tensions fuel a surge\nOil prices rose, driven by heightened Middle East tensions that increase the risk of supply disruptions.\nThis includes Saudi Arabia\u2019s reported airstrikes in Yemen and Iran\u2019s provocative rhetoric, which said that it is in a \u201cfull-fledged war\u201d with the US, Europe, and Israel.\n\u201cEnergy markets moved higher as geopolitical developments lent support to crude prices, with Brent edging up on renewed Middle East tensions and shifting Ukraine peace talks,\u201d IG analyst Axel Rudolph was quoted as saying in a Reuters report.\nThin trading volumes could pave the way for more volatility in the oil market at the start of next year, added Rudolph.\nAccording to a Sunday report from Bloomberg, President Trump indicated \u201ca lot of progress\u201d in his talks with Zelenskiy.\nHowever, he cautioned that no definitive breakthrough has been achieved on territorial disputes, suggesting a final agreement might still be several weeks away.\nMeanwhile, a meeting with Russia, according to Zelenskyy, can only take place once both President Trump and European leaders have consented to a peace framework put forth by Ukraine.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s price cuts and supply glut\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, is anticipated to reduce the price of its primary Arab Light crude for Asian customers in February.\nThis expected reduction is due to declines observed in the spot market, reflecting plentiful crude supplies, according to a Reuters survey of six Asia-based refining sources.\nThis decline would represent the third consecutive monthly drop, deepening losses from the January premium of 60 cents a barrel, which was already the lowest in five years.\nThe OSP for Arab Extra Light crude oil is anticipated to decrease in February, according to the latest market survey.\nThis decline is projected to be in the range of 10 to 20 cents per barrel.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s announcement of increased fiscal spending in 2026 suggests a proactive stance to stimulate economic growth, which is generally seen as a positive sign for future oil demand.\nThis comes as the crude oil market faces significant downward pressure. Despite the potential tailwind from Chinese stimulus, crude is currently headed for a more than 20% decline this year\u2014its steepest annual drop since 2020.\nThe primary factor driving this sharp decline is the widespread expectation of a global oil supply surplus in the coming year, overshadowing near-term positive demand signals.\nOn the other hand, US crude oil stockpiles data for the week ending December 19 is highly anticipated by investors.\nA Reuters poll, which was extended, suggests a likely decline in US crude oil inventories for the past week, although both distillate and gasoline inventories are projected to have increased.\nDue to the Christmas holiday, the report\u2019s release was postponed from its typical Wednesday schedule last week."

This sets the stage for a strong performance heading into 2026. According to top-tier trading platforms, Euro trading has remained positive, fueled by market expectations regarding the future policies of the US Federal Reserve compared to those of the European Central Bank (ECB).\nAmidst quiet holiday trading between Christmas and the New Year, the exchange rate settled near 1.1772. The US Dollar remains under pressure despite strong US growth data. Recently, financial markets have shifted their focus toward Federal Reserve policy outlooks and concerns over central bank independence, rather than short-term economic activity indicators.\nWith long positions on the euro increasing, the potential for further gains may depend on the emergence of new catalysts in early January.\nWill the Euro's gains continue in the coming days?\nTop Regulated Brokers\nAccording to forex market trading, the euro (EUR) remained stable in global markets last week, while the dollar remained under pressure despite better-than-expected US GDP data. Consequently, the EUR/USD exchange rate reached its highest level in three months, approaching 1.1810, before settling slightly below 1.18.\nRegarding factors influencing currency prices, any developments related to the incoming Federal Reserve Chair and other US central bank officials will be closely monitored. Looking ahead, MUFG Bank anticipates further limited net losses for the dollar in 2026 due to interest rate changes. They stated, \"We expect the European Central Bank to maintain its current monetary policy throughout 2026, justifying the EUR/USD exchange rate's rise in short-term yield movements, given that the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates at least three times, exceeding expectations.\"\nAfter an initial stabilization, the bank expects the EUR/USD exchange rate to reach 1.24 by the end of 2026.\nTrading Advice:\nTraders advise caution when trading during periods of low market liquidity, a natural reaction to holidays in many financial markets.\n2026 Trading Outlook:\nAccording to currency trading experts, the US dollar is likely to remain vulnerable to volatility in global markets until the start of the new year. However, the latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows an increase in non-commercial long positions in the euro to nearly 145,000 contracts from 138,000 contracts previously, its highest level in two years. This concentration will increase the risk of a euro correction early next year. Very strong resistance is also likely for the EUR/USD pair on any move towards the psychological resistance level of 1.20.\nOn the Economic Front, US GDP data for the third quarter showed annualized growth of 4.3%, compared to 3.8% previously, exceeding analysts' expectations of 3.3%. Consequently, financial markets are currently trading at a probability of less than 15% for another US interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in January, with two further cuts expected in 2026.\nReady to trade our daily Forex analysis?

The US Dollar (USD) started the week with a soft tone. Still, the pair was unable to advance beyond the 1.1800 mark, as holiday diminished volumes contain major pairs within limited intraday ranges.\nFinancial markets have little to focus on this week, as the macroeconomic calendar won\u2019t offer any relevant data. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release the Minutes of the December meeting next Wednesday. The document usually sheds light on policymakers\u2019 thinking during the rate-decision meeting. Given the limited trading volumes, the news can trigger a reaction in USD.\nThe EU did not publish relevant data earlier in the day, while the United States (US) will soon release November Pending Home Sales and the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index for December.\nEUR/USD short-term technical outlook\nFrom a technical point of view, the EUR/USD pair is bearish in the 4-hour chart. The EUR/USD trades at 1.1761, below the day's opening by 16 pips and little changed on a daily basis. In the same chart, the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) has flattened near 1.1780, providing dynamic resistance. At the same time, the pair remains above rising 100- and 200-period SMAs, preserving a positive medium-term tone. Meanwhile, the Momentum indicator edges lower below its midline, signaling waning buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator stands at 45 and inches down, aligning with the increased downward bias. A decisive push above the 20 SMA would revive upside traction, whereas a break beneath the 100 SMA would open the door for a deeper retracement toward the longer baseline.\nIn the daily chart, EUR/USD trades above all its moving averages, with the 20-day SMA rising above the 100- and 200-day SMAs, with all three sloping higher, reinforcing a bullish bias. The 20-day SMA at 1.1716 offers nearby dynamic support. Finally, the Momentum indicator remains above its midline, though it has eased modestly, signaling steady buying interest while the RSI indicator stands at 62, easing from its recent highs.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPremium\nYou have reached your limit of 3 free articles for this month.\nStart your subscription and get access to all our original articles.\nAuthor\nValeria Bednarik\nFXStreet\nValeria Bednarik was born and lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

                "body": "Early on Monday in Europe, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the US dollar against six major global currencies, was holding steady at 98.00. Given thin trading volumes, plenty of people are off work for the New Year holiday, so there\u2019s less money sloshing around to cause significant price swings.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) chopped the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its December meeting, knocking the target range down to 3.50%-3.75%. That\u2019s right \u2013 this is the 3rd cut the Fed has made in 2025 \u2013 a total of 75 bps.\nNow that the Fed has delivered these cuts, markets are looking at the possibility of more, at least two more in 2026. The CME FedWatch tool currently suggests there\u2019s an 18.3% chance the Fed will reduce rates at its next policy meeting in January.\nAfter last week\u2019s comments from Donald Trump about wanting the next Fed Chair to ease off on interest rates a bit if the markets do well, some folks are getting a bit worried about the Fed\u2019s independence. This could put extra downward pressure on the dollar.\nAll the same, geopolitical risk is pushing investors towards safe havens \u2013 and that\u2019s good news for the US dollar. On Sunday, Trump was talking about how he\u2019d made a lot of progress with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a possible peace deal \u2013 but he also said it might still be a few weeks before the deal\u2019s actually done. At the same time, all these geopolitical uncertainties are giving investors the jitters \u2013 and that means they\u2019re reaching for safe havens.\nSo, even though the Fed is looking to cut interest rates, the DXY is still holding firm \u2013 for now, at least. Traders are keeping a close eye on the Pending Home Sales report that\u2019s due out later today, as well as any more comments from Federal Reserve officials.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 98.02 after a bit of a bounce last week from that 97.73-97.80 support level. On the 2-hour chart, the price is still holding within a short-term rising channel, suggesting it has some momentum but isn\u2019t quite ready to shake off that downtrend just yet. The 50-day EMA at 98.12 is acting as a ceiling, while the 100-day EMA at 98.55-98.60 is a much stronger resistance level above.\nLooking at Fibonacci levels from that recent downward move, we can see the price struggling to get above that 38.2% retracement at 98.12, which is keeping any upside pretty firmly in check. If we can finally break above 98.25, then 98.55 looks like it might be in play \u2013 but if we fail to make that break, then 97.75 is looking like it\u2019s next port of call.\nThe GBP/USD pair is hovering around $1.3490 at the moment, trading in a tight range within a clear rising channel on a 2-hour chart. The bigger picture remains bullish, with the price staying above the channel midpoint and key moving averages.\nPrice is also holding up well above the 50-day EMA at $1.3470, which is currently acting as short-term support, and the 100-day EMA at $1.3340 is the foundation of the medium-term trend.\nThe immediate support is sitting around $1.3470-$1.3450, then comes the slightly stronger support just below $1.3410. On the other hand, there\u2019s resistance capping things at $1.3535, and the upper channel boundary is not far off at $1.3600.\nThe EUR/USD pair is still trading around $1.1780, though it\u2019s now stuck in a neat little rising channel on the 2-hour chart. Price action remains bullish, with buyers still strongly defending the lower channel boundary at $1.1750, which is short-term horizontal support.\nThe 50-day EMA comes in around $1.1765 and is acting as a real line of defence, while the 100-day EMA at $1.1705 is also adding to the overall bullish picture.\nOn the upside, there\u2019s some resistance around $1.1805, and then that upper channel limit comes in at $1.1850. As long as EUR/USD can stay above $1.1750, we\u2019re looking good for an upward trend \u2013 with dips naturally attracting buyers.\nArslan is a finance MBA and also holds an MPhil degree in behavioral finance.

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair sees a decline to approximately 1.3485 during the early European session on Monday, with increased demand for the US Dollar. Despite this weakening, the Bank of England\u2019s guidance on a gradual downward monetary policy could limit further downside risks for the pair.\nThe BoE cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3.75% in December, marking the first reduction since last August. Governor Andrew Bailey mentioned that while rates may continue to fall, the extent of additional cuts will require careful consideration. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve may make two rate cuts in 2026 due to a cooling labour market, with financial markets forecasting an 18.3% chance of a rate reduction by January.\nTechnical Analysis of GBP/USD\nOn the technical front, GBP/USD holds at 1.3486 with support from the 100-day EMA, suggesting a medium-term upward trend. Initial support is at 1.3393, while the first resistance is at 1.3547. Bollinger Bands indicate persistent bullish pressure, with potential for extension if the pair closes above the upper band.\nThe Pound Sterling is the oldest currency, issued by the Bank of England, and accounts for 12% of global foreign exchange transactions. Economic data and trade balance figures, alongside BoE\u2019s monetary policy, are key influences on its value.\nAs we look at the GBP/USD pair trading around 1.3485, its position above the 100-day moving average keeps the medium-term outlook positive. However, we see the Bank of England has already begun its easing cycle, having cut rates to 3.75% at its December 2025 meeting. This move was widely expected after the latest data from November 2025 showed UK inflation had fallen to 2.4%, bringing it much closer to the Bank\u2019s 2% target.\nThe BoE\u2019s dovish stance is further justified by an economy that has shown clear signs of stalling. We saw that UK GDP growth for the third quarter of 2025 was nearly flat at just 0.1%, and the most recent retail sales figures for November disappointed with a 0.5% month-over-month decline. This weak economic backdrop suggests that further rate cuts are likely in 2026, which could limit the Pound\u2019s potential upside.\nOutlook for the US Dollar\nOn the other side of the trade, the US Dollar is feeling pressure from expectations of future Federal Reserve rate cuts, even though they have not started yet. The November 2025 jobs report indicated a cooling labor market, with a lower-than-expected 140,000 jobs added and the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.1%. This, combined with the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge falling to 2.6%, has solidified market bets for at least two rate cuts during 2026.\nFor derivative traders, the critical factor in the coming weeks will be the relative pace of easing between the BoE and the Fed. Since the BoE has already made the first move, any surprisingly weak US economic data could accelerate expectations for Fed cuts and push the pair toward the 1.3547 resistance level. We believe using options to play rising volatility heading into the January 2026 central bank meetings could be a prudent strategy to manage this uncertainty.\nIn the near term, the pair remains in a bullish channel, with the technicals suggesting dips could be shallow. We would view a pullback towards the 1.3393 support level as a potential buying opportunity, especially if upcoming US data confirms a softening economy. This is a starkly different environment from the aggressive rate-hiking cycle we traded through back in 2022 and 2023, where monetary policy provided a clear tailwind for the dollar."

This could put extra downward pressure on the dollar.\nAll the same, geopolitical risk is pushing investors towards safe havens \u2013 and that\u2019s good news for the US dollar. On Sunday, Trump was talking about how he\u2019d made a lot of progress with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a possible peace deal \u2013 but he also said it might still be a few weeks before the deal\u2019s actually done. At the same time, all these geopolitical uncertainties are giving investors the jitters \u2013 and that means they\u2019re reaching for safe havens.\nSo, even though the Fed is looking to cut interest rates, the DXY is still holding firm \u2013 for now, at least. Traders are keeping a close eye on the Pending Home Sales report that\u2019s due out later today, as well as any more comments from Federal Reserve officials.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 98.02 after a bit of a bounce last week from that 97.73-97.80 support level. On the 2-hour chart, the price is still holding within a short-term rising channel, suggesting it has some momentum but isn\u2019t quite ready to shake off that downtrend just yet. The 50-day EMA at 98.12 is acting as a ceiling, while the 100-day EMA at 98.55-98.60 is a much stronger resistance level above.\nLooking at Fibonacci levels from that recent downward move, we can see the price struggling to get above that 38.2% retracement at 98.12, which is keeping any upside pretty firmly in check. If we can finally break above 98.25, then 98.55 looks like it might be in play \u2013 but if we fail to make that break, then 97.75 is looking like it\u2019s next port of call.\nThe GBP/USD pair is hovering around $1.3490 at the moment, trading in a tight range within a clear rising channel on a 2-hour chart. The bigger picture remains bullish, with the price staying above the channel midpoint and key moving averages.\nPrice is also holding up well above the 50-day EMA at $1.3470, which is currently acting as short-term support, and the 100-day EMA at $1.3340 is the foundation of the medium-term trend.\nThe immediate support is sitting around $1.3470-$1.3450, then comes the slightly stronger support just below $1.3410. On the other hand, there\u2019s resistance capping things at $1.3535, and the upper channel boundary is not far off at $1.3600.\nThe EUR/USD pair is still trading around $1.1780, though it\u2019s now stuck in a neat little rising channel on the 2-hour chart. Price action remains bullish, with buyers still strongly defending the lower channel boundary at $1.1750, which is short-term horizontal support.\nThe 50-day EMA comes in around $1.1765 and is acting as a real line of defence, while the 100-day EMA at $1.1705 is also adding to the overall bullish picture.\nOn the upside, there\u2019s some resistance around $1.1805, and then that upper channel limit comes in at $1.1850. As long as EUR/USD can stay above $1.1750, we\u2019re looking good for an upward trend \u2013 with dips naturally attracting buyers.\nArslan is a finance MBA and also holds an MPhil degree in behavioral finance.

The Aussie pair gives back its intraday gains as the Australian Dollar (AUD) faces profit-booking after rallying for weeks, with the US Dollar (USD) trading broadly calm.\nAustralian Dollar Price This Month\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies this month.

RBA hawkish expectations are backed by rising Australian inflationary pressures. Australian monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises at a faster pace of 3.8% year-on-year (YoY) in October.\nAs of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades flat around 98.00.\nThe US Dollar flattens ahead of the release of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes on Tuesday. Investors will pay close attention to the FOMC minutes to get fresh cues on the United States (US) interest rate outlook.\nIn the policy meeting, the Fed reduced interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% and signaled that there will be only one in the entire 2026. On the contrary, the CME FedWatch tool shows the odds of the Fed reducing interest rates at least 50 bps in 2026 are 73.3%.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting fo"

However, there is a chance that the other Fed officials will push back against these cuts, especially if inflation remains above the 2% target.\nMeanwhile, there are chances that the RBA will hike interest rates or maintain the status quo in the coming meetings. Officials have already hinted that they will not be in a hurry to cut rates, especially if inflation remains at an elevated level.\nRecent data showed that Australia\u2019s inflation continued rising, a trend that may continue in the coming months.\nThe soaring commodity prices are also boosting the AUD/USD pair. Top commodities like copper, gold, and silver have all surged in the past few months. Iron ore is also rising. Historically, the Australian dollar has been seen as a commodity proxy because of the vast amounts that it exports to China.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows that the AUD/USD exchange rate has been in a strong uptrend in the past few weeks. It rose and crossed the important resistance level at 0.6685, the previous year-to-date high.\nThe pair has jumped above all moving averages and the Supertrend indicator. Also, top indicators like the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have continued rising.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue rising as bulls target the next important resistance level at 0.6800.

The Summary of Opinions published today reaffirmed the tightening bias, with one member stating that further increases are needed to \"avoid falling behind the curve\" and another noting that there remains a \"considerable distance to the neutral\". [2]\nThe central bank retains scope for further tightening as core inflation remains well above the 2% target, while elevated wage growth is expected to persist into the next fiscal year. In addition, the US-Japan trade agreement to lower tariffs and the government's sizeable fiscal stimulus could support the economy.\nThis hawkish bias is supporting the yen, alongside recent currency intervention warnings from Japanese officials. These include comments from the Finance Minister, who stated that \"we are always ready to act\" in a Bloomberg interview last week [3]. Meanwhile, the USDOLLAR is weighed down by the Fed's December rate cut and its easing bias [4], as the US economy and labour market face tariff-related headwinds.\nThese monetary policy dynamics are pressuring USD/JPY, leaving the pair vulnerable to a break below the 200-day EMA, which would challenge the upside momentum. However, the downside appears technically well protected, with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the ascending trendline from the September lows following. This creates scope for a recovery and keeps the 2025 peak in play.\nThe Bank of Japan may have raised rates but maintained its slow and gradual approach, while economic headwinds may limit the extent of further tightening. Moreover, the US central bank remains on a cautious easing path, with the latest Summary of Economic Projections pointing to just one rate cut in 2026.\nNikos Tzabouras\nSenior Financial Editorial Writer\nNikos Tzabouras is a graduate of the Department of International & European Economic Studies at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

The positive impact from the hawkishly-tilted Summary of Opinions of the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) Monetary Policy Meeting seen during Monday\u2019s Asian session has waned during London trading.\nThe Yen appreciated across the board after the Japanese central bank published the minutes of the last monetary policy meeting. BoJ policymakers observed that rates are still far from neutral, although some of them advised proceeding with caution to avoid undesired consequences on the economy and markets.\nThe Bank of Japan hiked its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% basis points to a 30-year high of 0.75% in December and signalled further rate cuts in 2026 amid the bank\u2019s overall commitment to monetary policy normalisation.\nInvestors, however, remain concerned about Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s pro-stimulus measures and their potential impact on an already stretched Japanese fiscal deficit. Fears of a debt crisis are acting as a significant headwind for a steady Yen recovery.\nThe US Dollar, on the other hand, remains weighed by market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark rate at least two more times in 2026, against the bank\u2019s projection of a single rate cut. On Tuesday, the release of the minutes of the December meeting is likely to shed further light on the topic, and might set the near-term direction of the USD/JPY pair.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said last week that Japan has full freedom to act against excessive moves in the yen.\nBart Wakabayashi, head of State Street\u2019s Tokyo branch, said these intervention warnings have helped limit positioning in dollar/yen, although bearish sentiment toward the Japanese currency is evident in other foreign exchange pairs.\n\u201cI think holding long yen positions is extremely painful,\u201d Wakabayashi said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some expression of short yen positions against those currencies, especially against the Australian dollar.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe market is still trying to understand the role the yen plays now in terms of being a safe haven.\u201d\nThe dollar was last down 0.26% at 156.3 yen, after jumping 0.45% on Friday. The yen traded at 105.02 per Australian dollar, just shy of the 17-month low of 105.08 reached on Friday.\nThe dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of peers, edged slightly lower to 97.95. The euro ticked up marginally to $1.1780, while sterling was steady at $1.3503.\nThe Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate to a 30-year high of 0.75% from 0.5% at its December meeting. The summary of opinions released on Monday showed that many board members saw the need for further rate hikes, with real interest rates still deeply negative once inflation is taken into account.\nHowever, the rate hike failed to stem the yen\u2019s decline, with the currency falling to 157.78 per dollar on December 19, prompting renewed intervention warnings. Japan last intervened to support the yen in July 2024, when it bought the currency after it slid to a 38-year low of 161.96 per dollar.\nWith limited data this week and thin trading ahead of New Year holidays in many markets, geopolitical developments moved to the forefront.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were \u201cvery close, perhaps extremely close\u201d to reaching an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, although both leaders acknowledged that some of the most complex issues remain unresolved.\nIn Asia, tensions remained elevated as China deployed military units around Taiwan ahead of live-fire drills scheduled for Tuesday. Meanwhile, North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch of long-range missiles on Sunday, while South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said further tests could take place around New Year\u2019s Day.\nThe main data focus this week will be the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, from a gathering held earlier this month. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates at that meeting and projected just one additional cut next year, while market participants have priced in at least two more.\nGoldman Sachs analysts said in a note: \u201cThe FOMC adjusted its post-meeting statement to signal a higher bar for further rate cuts, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reinforced this message during his press conference. We expect the December minutes to point to continued disagreement among committee members over the appropriate near-term path of monetary policy.\u201d\nThe Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6717, while the Swiss franc was firmer at 0.787 per dollar.\nSilver prices fell by more than 6% in the European market on Monday, driven by accelerating correction and profit-taking activity, after earlier hitting a fresh all-time high during Asian trading by breaking above the $80 per ounce level for the first time ever.\nIn addition to profit-taking pressure, silver prices came un"

After trading near a five-month low around 1.3640 late last week, the pair benefits from a modest return of demand for the US Dollar (USD) amid thin liquidity at the start of a holiday-shortened week.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) had recently found support from rising Oil prices, as Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States (US). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) US Oil prices are recovering after sharp losses in the previous day, supported by persistent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and concerns over potential supply disruptions. However, this commodity-related support appears to be losing momentum in the near term, limiting the Canadian Dollar\u2019s ability to extend its gains.\nOn the monetary policy front, the US Dollar remains broadly under pressure but shows signs of stabilization. Investors continue to price in the prospect of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026, following the 25-basis-point rate cut delivered at the December meeting, which brought the target range to 3.50%-3.75%. The Federal Reserve has now delivered a cumulative 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2025, amid a gradually cooling labor market and inflation that remains above target.\nMarket focus now turns to the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, due on Tuesday, which could provide further insight into internal policy debates and the outlook for the coming year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of rates being left unchanged at the January meeting remains high, while expectations of an immediate rate cut continue to fade.\nOn the Canadian side, expectations remain more stable. The Bank of Canada (BoC) is expected to maintain a cautious stance, as inflation has remained slightly above the 2% target in recent months. Minutes from the latest meeting confirmed that policymakers consider the current policy stance appropriate, while standing ready to adjust if the economic outlook changes materially. This contrast between the expected monetary policy paths continues to keep USD/CAD in a consolidation phase.\n(This story was corrected on December 29 at 13:55 GMT to remove a reference that USD/CAD ended a four-day losing streak.)\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today. Canadian Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Canadian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent CAD (base)/USD (quote).\nAuthor\nGhiles Guezout\nFXStreet\nGhiles Guezout is a Market Analyst with a strong background in stock market investments, trading, and cryptocurrencies.

                "body": "The USD/CAD pair has shown depreciation for a second consecutive session, hovering around 1.3660, close to the five-month low of 1.3642. This decline is influenced by the rise in Oil prices, with the Canadian Dollar benefiting from Canada\u2019s role as the largest crude exporter to the US.\nOil prices see a recovery, with West Texas Intermediate trading at approximately $57.20, as tensions in the Middle East escalate due to Saudi airstrikes in Yemen and Iran\u2019s aggressive stance against the US, Europe, and Israel. The potential disruption in oil supply is contributing to the increase in crude prices.\nThe Us Dollar Weakens\nThe US Dollar is weakening, partly due to the anticipation of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026, with traders looking forward to the FOMC December Meeting Minutes for insights. The Federal Reserve recently reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, leading to a cumulative 75 bps cut in 2025.\nThe CME FedWatch tool indicates an 81.7% probability of interest rates being maintained at the Fed\u2019s January meeting. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has decreased to 18.3%.\nThe Canadian Dollar is affected by various factors, including the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rates, oil prices, economic health, and inflation. Market sentiment and the health of the US economy also play roles in influencing the CAD.\nAs we approach the end of 2025, we are seeing the USD/CAD pair test significant lows not seen in five months. The primary drivers are clear: rising oil prices are boosting the Canadian dollar, while expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve are weighing on the US dollar. This downward pressure on the currency pair presents specific opportunities and risks for the coming weeks.\nFactors Influencing Oil Prices\nThe strength in crude oil is a key factor, with West Texas Intermediate trading around $57 a barrel amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has shown consistent draws on crude inventories over the past month, further supporting prices. Given Canada\u2019s position as a top energy exporter, these higher oil prices create a fundamental tailwind for the Canadian dollar, suggesting that any trade looking for a stronger USD against the CAD faces an uphill battle.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US dollar is softening based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions throughout 2025. We have already seen the Fed deliver 75 basis points in rate cuts this year, a response to a cooling US labor market where November\u2019s non-farm payrolls report showed job growth slowing significantly. With the market pricing in the possibility of two more cuts in 2026, the path of least resistance for the greenback appears to be lower.\nFor derivative traders, this environment favors strategies that profit from a continued decline in USD/CAD. Buying put options on the pair could provide leveraged exposure to the downside, with a key target being a decisive break below the 1.3642 support level. Selling out-of-the-money call spreads would be a more conservative approach, designed to profit if the pair stays below a certain resistance level while generating income from the premium.\nHowever, we must watch for potential reversals heading into January 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, due this Tuesday, could reveal a more divided or cautious stance than the market currently anticipates, which would strengthen the US dollar. Furthermore, any de-escalation of conflict in the Middle East could quickly unwind the recent rally in oil prices, removing a major pillar of support for the Canadian dollar."

As one of the largest crude oil suppliers to the United States, Canada's currency is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international oil prices. In the oil market, WTI experienced a technical rebound after falling approximately 2.5% in the previous trading session, currently trading near $57.20 per barrel.\nMarket sentiment has been affected by the ongoing escalation of tensions in the Middle East, with concerns over potential supply disruptions resurfacing to support oil prices. A stronger oil price directly improves Canada\u2019s terms of trade, providing positive support for the Canadian Dollar.\nInvestors will focus on the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting, scheduled for release on Tuesday, to assess internal divisions among policymakers regarding the future policy trajectory.\nLooking back at the policy context, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 3.50%\u20133.75% during its December meeting, with cumulative rate cuts projected to total 75 basis points for 2025, against a backdrop of a gradually cooling labor market but inflation still above target.\nThe CME FedWatch tool indicates that the market now assigns an 81.7% probability to the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates unchanged at its January meeting, while the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has dropped to 18.3%, reflecting a cautious short-term policy stance.\nFrom a daily chart perspective, USD/CAD has been trending lower in a sustained downtrend since the November high, operating within a clearly defined descending channel. The current exchange rate has broken below the key support level of 1.3700 and is repeatedly testing lows in the 1.3640\u20131.3660 range, signaling dominance by bearish trends.\nIn terms of the moving average system, both short-term and medium-term moving averages are arranged in a bearish configuration and continue to diverge downward, exerting significant downward pressure on the exchange rate. The RSI indicator is hovering near 40, not yet entering extreme oversold territory, suggesting that downside potential remains technically open.\nIf the exchange rate subsequently breaks below 1.3640 effectively, USD/CAD may further decline toward the 1.3550\u20131.3580 region; conversely, if a technical rebound occurs, the 1.3720\u20131.3750 range will serve as the primary resistance zone.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nAgainst the backdrop of recovering oil prices and dovish expectations for US dollar policy, USD/CAD still faces downward pressure in the short term. As long as crude oil prices remain relatively strong, the Canadian dollar's relative advantage is unlikely to weaken.\nHowever, considering that the exchange rate is already close to a phase low, caution is warranted against a technical rebound triggered by a pullback in oil prices or shifts in risk sentiment. Nevertheless, before the trend is disrupted, the overall outlook remains biased toward weakness with fluctuations."

The pair is trading near 210.50 at the time of writing after pulling back from session highs at 211.43.\nThe Japanese Yen depreciated further last week as investors pondered the timing of the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) interest rate hike, amid growing concerns about the impact of Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s expansive policies on the country's already strained accounts.\nTakaichi\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Takayama launched the strongest warning to date last week.

                "body": "Bitcoin Nears Red Yearly Close: Galaxy Digital Explains The Setup\nBitcoin is heading into New Year\u2019s Eve on the verge of printing a red yearly candle, an awkward setup after a year packed with pro-crypto policy and institutional headlines. Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn said BTC is down 6.3% year-to-date and 8.25% year-over-year, and would need a daily close above $93,389 on New Year\u2019s Eve to finish 2025 positive.\nThe late-year mood has been defined by a soft Q4 tape and a deeper drawdown than many bulls expected this late in the cycle. Thorn noted BTC traded as low as roughly 36% below its Oct. 6, 2025 all-time high of $125,296, even as a steady stream of bullish headlines landed throughout the year.\n\u201cDespite the tepid finish, 2025 was a banner year for Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin\u2019s staunchest supporters wouldn\u2019t have believed some of 2025\u2019s headlines just a few years ago\u2026 2025 has been filled with dozens of positive headlines for Bitcoin that in the past would have sparked euphoria. Today, these victories feel like par for the course. Maybe we really are \u2018tired of winning?\u2019\u201d Thorn wrote in Galaxy\u2019s weekly research note.\nBitcoin On Verge Of Red Yearly Candle\nThorn argued that part of the market\u2019s stalled feel is mechanical, not philosophical. He pointed to a large month-end options expiry as a potential catalyst for loosening the range-bound behavior he described between the mid-$80,000s and $90,000.\nRelated Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin\u2019s Most Important Resistance Level\n\u201cA significant options expiry at the end of the month clear some of the outstanding dealer gamma that has encouraged bitcoin to stay pinned between major $85k and $90k, and January may prompt some portfolio managers to take a fresh look at the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency. There are reasons why the quiet period we\u2019ve seen for the last month will not persist in the near term.\u201d\nHe also cited headwinds that hit spot demand and risk appetite: \u201csignificant whale distribution,\u201d an Oct. 10 leverage wipeout, and competition from other macro trades such as AI, hyperscalers, gold, and the \u201cMag 7.\u201d One of Thorn\u2019s key observations was the divergence between bitcoin\u2019s drawdown and US bitcoin ETF behavior.\nHe said US bitcoin ETF cumulative inflows are down only 9% from their October peak of $62 billion, even though bitcoin fell sharply from its highs and, in his estimate, 60% of ETF inflows are underwater at current prices.\nThat resilience, he argued, makes the source of selling more notable. \u201cSo, who has been selling?\u201d Thorn wrote. \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house.\u201d Since July 2025, he said coins held by long-term holders have declined more sharply than at any point in the eight years since the 2017 bull run, suggesting older on-chain holders have been net sellers into newer brokerage-led demand.\nThorn framed that distribution as painful in the short run but constructive for the asset\u2019s long-run maturity, lifting the average cost basis and broadening ownership. He highlighted bitcoin\u2019s realized market cap above $1.1 trillion and a realized price above $56,000 as evidence of the network\u2019s rising aggregate principal.\nIn a Dec. 21 post summarizing Galaxy\u2019s 2026 outlook, Thorn said Galaxy predicts bitcoin to hit $250,000 by year-end 2027, while calling 2026 \u201ctoo chaotic to predict.\u201d Options markets, he noted, are currently pricing roughly equal odds of $70,000 or $130,000 by end-June 2026, and $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026, reflecting unusually wide uncertainty bands.\nHe also pointed to a structural decline in longer-term volatility and a changed skew: the BTC vol smile now prices puts as more expensive than calls, which he described as a shift toward patterns more typical of macro assets than high-growth markets.\nLooking into 2026, Thorn\u2019s near-term marker is whether BTC can \u201cfirmly re-establish\u201d itself above $100,000\u2013$105,000. Over the longer run, he argued the bigger story is demand for non-dollar hedges\u2014and how little incremental allocation might"

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s record staking queue looks bullish, but one corporate giant is secretly distorting the real signal\nEthereum\u2019s staking congestion signals institutional interest amidst regulatory progress, led by BitMine\u2019s bold move.\nA single corporate treasury has effectively hijacked Ethereum\u2019s validator mechanics, executing a billion-dollar maneuver that has flipped the network\u2019s flow data from a steady exodus to a sudden traffic jam.\nFor the first time in six months, the queue to stake ETH, locking up tokens to secure the blockchain in exchange for yield, significantly outstrips the line to exit.\nData compiled by the Ethereum Validator Queue tracker shows approximately 734,299 ETH waiting for entry, implying a mandatory delay of nearly two weeks before these coins can begin earning rewards. By comparison, the exit queue holds roughly 343,179 ETH, with a delay of six days.\nOn the surface, the data suggests a broad resurgence in investor sentiment, a bullish signal for a proof-of-stake network where participation is often read as a proxy for long-term confidence.\nHowever, a closer examination of the on-chain flows reveals a more concentrated reality. Nearly half of the entire entry backlog, 342,560 ETH, originates from a single entity: BitMine, the largest public ETH holding firm.\nThe digital asset treasury firm\u2019s aggressive entry over the past 48 hours has distorted the signal, masking what remains a cautious market environment.\nWhile the validator line is indeed moving up, the \u201ccrowd\u201d is arguably a single whale creating a wake that retail and smaller institutional players are merely drafting behind.\nFor traders and analysts, distinguishing between broad organic demand and idiosyncratic corporate treasury management has become the primary challenge of the holiday trading session.\nThe regulatory thaw\nWhile BitMine dominates the immediate flows, its move is not occurring in a vacuum.\nIt coincides with a pivotal shift in the regulatory environment that has fundamentally reduced the risk of staking for US institutions.\nIn a landmark clarification earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that liquid staking activities, specifically the receipt of tokens representing staked assets, do not constitute securities transactions, provided the provider exerts no managerial effort.\nThis was followed in November by the IRS and Treasury Department issuing Revenue Procedure 2025-31. This guidance created a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and trusts, allowing them to stake digital assets without jeopardizing their tax status as grantor trusts.\nAsset manager Grayscale stated that these two policy changes have effectively greenlit a new era of product structure.\nIn a recent note to clients, the firm's analysts argued that crypto ETPs' ability to stake will likely make them the default structure for holding investment positions in proof-of-stake tokens.\nDue to this, the firm predicts a bifurcated market in which custodial staking via ETPs captures the passive bid, exerting pressure on reward rates. In contrast, on-chain liquid staking retains the advantages of composability within DeFi.\nThis regulatory clarity explains why capital is moving now. The \u201cinstitutional pipeline\u201d is no longer blocked by compliance ambiguity.\nAs a result, the market has seen BlackRock advance its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ticker: ETHB), and Grayscale has already enabled staking for its Ethereum Trust (ETHE).\nThese regulated vehicles are now routing portions of their massive established holdings into the validator set, transforming static assets into productive ones.\nFrom experiment to expectation\nMeanwhile, this shift has forced a maturity upgrade across the crypto infrastructure stack.\nStaking represents a new form of yield on otherwise idle digital assets, but for institutions, the implications go far beyond simple returns.\nThe primary driver is capital efficiency: the ability to convert static holdings into producti"

Incoming ETH now outweighs withdrawals by almost two to one.\nAccording to the latest data from the Ethereum Validator Queue, approximately 745,000\u2013746,000 ETH is now waiting to enter the validator set, compared with roughly 360,000 ETH in the exit queue.\nThis means nearly twice as much ETH is being lined up to stake as to withdraw, signaling a marked increase in staking demand relative to outflows.\nOver the weekend, both queues hovered around 460,000 ETH; after that, the entry line picked up speed, with analysts warning the exit queue may soon hit zero at the current pace.\nAbdul says the exit queue was a leading indicator of selling pressure in 2025\nAbdul, who heads DeFi at Monad, described the change as historically significant, referencing a June reversal that saw Ether\u2019s price double. He contended that he expects a rather dramatic 2026. Back in June, ETH was trading around $2,800 before hitting a record high of $4,946 in late August, though it\u2019s now hovering near $3,000.\nEthereum relies on proof-of-stake, meaning validators must stake ETH to help secure the blockchain. Rising exits suggest selling, whereas increased staking signals confidence and lower near-term supply.\nFor starters, Abdul said the exit queue has served as a leading indicator of selling pressure in 2025. According to his estimates, 5% of all Ether has changed hands since July, largely due to Kiln\u2019s September unstaking, with BitMine taking in about 70% of that ETH, thereby gaining a 3.4% share of the total supply.\nIn September, Kiln had initiated a controlled withdrawal of its validators after an exploit at the digital asset platform SwissBorg. The firm defended its action, stating that it was more of a precaution rather than a sign of lost confidence in Ethereum.\nDylan Grabowski links staking surge to demand from digital asset treasury firms\nAbdul suggested that at the current pace, the exit queue might be empty by January 3, possibly diminishing the selling pressure on the market and bringing a little more stability.\nSome in the crypto space, including Dylan Grabowski, host of the Smart Economy Podcast, attribute the staking surge to rising demand from digital asset treasury firms. BitMine, for example, staked over 342,000 ETH \u2014 roughly $1 billion \u2014 within just two days, according to Lookchain data.\nOthers, including Ignas, the pseudonymous co-founder of DeFi Creator Studio Pink Brains, also cited additional reasons for the boom, including Ethereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade, which aims to make staking easier and extend limits on validators to accommodate large investors. Ignas also said that higher borrowing rates and the unwinding of leveraged staking in DeFi could have further shifted supply flows.\nBlackRock applied for a staked Ethereum ETF\nEarlier this month, BlackRock filed for a staked Ethereum ETF, a big step toward mainstream staking exposure. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) review is underway; however, a formal approval timeline will begin after the listing exchange files a Form 19b-4. The firm had alluded to iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB) via a Delaware-registered name in November, but no formal SEC application was made at the time.\nBefore that, the firm and other issuers had formed the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024. However, at the time, Gary Gensler \u2014 the leading figure at this agency \u2014 was alleged by many to have demanded the removal of staking components due to potential unregistered securities issues posed by platforms such as Kraken and Coinbase.\nIf you're reading this, you\u2019re already ahead.

                "body": "In 2025, Solana received a new, atypical source of demand. Treasury companies and exchange-traded funds focused on SOL accumulated nearly 5% of the token\u2019s circulating supply over the year. The combined reserves of these entities exceed 28 million SOL and are becoming a factor that the market will take into account in 2026 as well.\nPart of these assets is already involved in staking and supporting validators. This means it is not just about passive holding, but about growing influence on the Solana ecosystem from within.\nWho bought SOL and how much\nSolana\u2019s treasury reserves expanded throughout 2025, but new purchases stopped in December.\nAccording to analysts, strategic entities, including treasury companies and ETFs, have formed reserves of more than 20 million SOL. At current prices, their combined value is about $2.6 billion.\nOf this amount, about 9.5 million SOL are already staked. Such a volume of delegation strengthens the positions of validators working with large holders and increases their role in Solana\u2019s network economy.\nAlthough the pace of purchases throughout the year was uneven, the very fact that almost 5% of the supply is concentrated in the hands of a limited group of players changes the token\u2019s ownership structure.\nTreasury companies slowed down purchases\nBy the end of the year, treasury companies focused on Solana had effectively stopped increasing their reserves. In December, there was no net inflow of SOL to their balances, despite the token\u2019s price decline.\nAt the same time, interest in such companies on the stock market decreased. After the peak hype in the third quarter, the shares of most players went into correction.\nForward Industries, the largest of such entities, still shows about 40% growth for the year, but its quotes have noticeably rolled back from the September high of $39. At the same time, the value of its SOL reserve is estimated at $871 million, while the company\u2019s market capitalization has dropped to $608.8 million. This indicates a cooling of interest in \u2018proxy investments\u2019 through shares.\nA similar trend is observed among other participants. Solana Company, which owns about 2.3 million SOL, has not been able to recover its share price after a sharp drop. The former biotech company trades around $2.78, which is incomparable to the March peak. DeFi Dev Corp, the third largest treasury entity with a reserve of about 2.19 million SOL, ends the year near $5.76, having lost most of its value from the yearly high.\nFocus on yield within the ecosystem\nAmid a lack of new inflows, treasury companies are increasingly dependent on Solana\u2019s internal economy. The main sources of income are staking, validator rewards, and commissions from ecosystem applications.\nThis model can work provided the SOL price remains relatively stable. However, it makes companies more sensitive to changes in network activity and the real profitability of applications, rather than speculative token growth.\nETFs continue to buy\nUnlike treasury companies, Solana ETFs maintain positive inflow dynamics. Over the past three weeks, the funds have mostly recorded net purchases.\nAt the moment, ETFs have accumulated about 7.86 million SOL, and total assets under management have exceeded $1 billion. This level is considered important, as after reaching it, funds may review their fee structure.\nAt the same time, ETFs remain a less stable source of long-term demand. Unlike treasury companies, funds can quickly change their positioning when market conditions change.\nPrice lags, attention remains\nDespite the concentration of supply and growth in on-chain activity, SOL still trades within a range. The price remains below $130 and does not show a steady impulse to update highs.\nAt the same time, Solana maintains a high share of attention on social networks. According to analytics platforms, its mindshare exceeds 10% and has grown by more than 29% recently. The network remains one of the key platforms for decentralized applications and is "

That doesn\u2019t mean traders are done taking risks. The attention has gone back to memecoins, especially those built on Solana [SOL].\nNFTs are so yesterday!\nOver the past year, overall NFT activity has gradually decreased, with few spikes and a flat trading pattern across marketplaces. What\u2019s interesting is where the remaining volume is going. NFT market share has become increasingly concentrated, with OpenSea and Blur accounting for the bulk of total trading volume, while smaller platforms lose relevance.\nA handful of marketplaces dominate NFT trading, while most others contribute only a sliver of activity. Interest is shrinking, with traders sticking to the most liquid venues and avoiding risk.\nNFTs are definitely losing pace, and they are no longer where the spotlight is right now.\nAttention is flocking into memecoins instead\nCoinMarketCap data shows consistent volume across the largest memecoins; big names like Dogecoin [DOGE], Shiba Inu [SHIB], Pepe [PEPE] are proof \u2013 even on tame days, their numbers are astounding. Newer entrants are seeing strong daily trading activity too. Many of the most actively traded tokens over the past week are either native to Solana or heavily traded on it.\nThis is where the network stands out. Several Solana-based memecoins post high volume despite smaller market caps; they\u2019re frequently traded rather than held long-term. Low transaction fees and fast settlement make it easier for traders to enter and exit positions quickly. This keeps activity elevated.\nThis was perhaps what lead to the quick rotation from NFTs.\nWhat traders are responding to\nIt\u2019s not just about NFTs versus memecoins; it\u2019s about how traders want to participate. Capital is moving toward fast, flexible and constantly engaging assets. Memecoins fit that need better right now than NFTs, which often require patience, higher upfront costs, and longer holding periods.\nAnother change is scale. Memecoins allow smaller traders to stay active without committing large amounts of money. That\u2019s harder in both NFTs and large-cap crypto. There\u2019s more participation, even if it is mindless fun. Traders are choosing markets that let them move quickly, and step away just as fast.\nFinal Thoughts\n- NFT trading volume is lesser and concentrated on just two marketplaces.\n- Memecoins, especially on Solana, are where it\u2019s at now, with low fees and fast trades."

This centralization of value has created a robust ecosystem where developers and institutions feel confident building complex applications.\nA real world example can be found in decentralized exchanges.

The network has already processed billions of dollars in transactions with low fees, attracting developers who need efficiency at scale.\nRecent trends highlight Solana\u2019s rise in areas where throughput is critical. For example, some NFT projects and crypto games have shifted to Solana to handle large volumes of small, rapid transactions that would be costly or slow on Ethereum.

Tesla (TSLA) stock was down 2.3%, while the other members of the Magnificent Seven all were down modestly with the exception of Apple (AAPL), whose shares were up slightly.\nGold futures declined 3% to about $4,415 an ounce after setting their latest all-time high of nearly $4,585 on Friday. Silver futures fell nearly 6.5% to $72.20 an ounce after touching a record above $82.65 earlier Monday.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, surged more than 2% to $58 per barrel amid U.S.-Venezuela tensions.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, slipped to 4.12% from Friday's close of below 4.14%.\nBitcoin was trading around $87,500, down from an overnight high of roughly $90,300.

It put billions of dollars into OpenAI earlier this year, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most-valuable startup.\nWhich States Are Seeing the Highest Foreclosure Activity Right Now\nIn many states across the U.S., homeowners are struggling to keep up with their housing costs.\nAs of November, foreclosure activity had risen by 21% when compared with the same month last year.

                "body": "Top Dow Jones Index news to watch in 2026\nThe Dow Jones Index continued its recent rally, rising by 15% this year and hitting its all-time high of $48,862. It has jumped by ~35% from its highest level in April this year. This article explores the top US30 Index news to watch in 2026.\nDow Jones Index to react to key earnings\nThe Dow Jones Index will react to corporate earnings from its constituent companies in the index. Analysts are highly optimistic that American companies will continue doing well as they did this year amid the tariff uncertainty.\nData compiled by FactSet shows that the S&P 500 Index companies experienced double-digit earnings growth in all quarters of the year.\nMost of the earnings growth was driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that continued for the third year. A good example of this is Nvidia, the biggest company in the world, whose revenue jumped to over $57 billion in the third quarter.\nOther companies in the Dow Jones, like Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and Boeing continued to publish strong financial results during the year.\nThe strong earnings explain the surge in the index\u2019s top gainers like Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Nvidia, IBM, and JPMorgan. For example, the most recent results showed that Goldman Sachs earnings jumped, helped by the trading boom and the return of investment banking.\nTherefore, the Dow Jones Index will react to earnings as they will provide more color on growth, and most importantly, the AI boom.\nFederal Reserve news\nThe other important news that will impact the Dow Jones and other US indices are the Federal Reserve. One of the Fed news items will be the appointment of the next chairman by Donald Trump and the vetting process.\nTrump has interviewed several potential officials, including Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller, and Rick Rieder. Market participants now expect that Hassett will be nominated to replace Jerome Powell.\nThe potential nominee will have a major impact on the Dow Jones and other indices as Trump has vowed to appoint an official who will cut interest rates.\nStill, the bank\u2019s decisions will be determined by the whole FOMC committee, and there are chances that the members will push back against the chairman.\nThe other Fed news that will impact the Dow Jones Index are the monetary policy decisions, which will happen in January, March, April, June, July, September, November, and December.\nMost analysts believe that the bank will deliver at least three interest rate cuts in 2026, a move that may boost American stocks.\nThe other major Fed news will be the firing of Lisa Cook, who Trump accused of conducting mortgage fraud. A court will deliver the verdict on whether the firing was justified. If it is upheld, it means that Trump may fire more Fed officials who are not ready to cut rates.\nAdditionally, the index will react to the upcoming macro data, like inflation and the labor market, which will help to determine the next Fed action.\nAI boom to continue?\nThe other important Dow Jones Index news will be on the AI boom, which has propelled American stocks to record highs this year.\nTherefore, there are concerns about whether the boom will continue and whether it will burst during the year. Fears that the latter will happen explains why top stocks like Nvidia and Oracle have slumped in the past few weeks.\nThe upcoming earnings will help to determine whether the boom in the AI industry is accelerating. For example, a significant slowdown in earnings and forward guidance of top companies like Nvidia and Microsoft will help to determine this.\nOther catalysts for the Dow Jones Index\nThere will be other major catalysts for the Dow Jones Index this year, including geopolitics like the relationship between the US and China, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. China will deliver its decision on rare earth materials exports later during the year.\nThe index will also react to the US midterm election in which Democrats are expected to win by a lands"

                "body": "Prediction: This Dividend-Paying Dow Jones Growth Stock Will Beat the S&P 500 For the 6th Consecutive Year in 2026\nKey Points\nAmerican Express has beaten the S&P 500 every year since 2021.\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings reinforce its investment thesis.\nAmerican Express is benefiting from an affluent card member base.\nAmerican Express (NYSE: AXP) just rocketed to an all-time high after a blowout earnings report and a raised forecast.\nAt the time of this writing, the financial stock is up 20% year-to-date compared to 15% for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) component on track to beat the S&P 500 yet again. American Express has outperformed the S&P 500 every year since 2021. Which is impressive, considering that period of market gains has been driven largely by tech-focused growth companies and artificial intelligence stocks.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nHere's why American Express has what it takes to beat the S&P 500 and the Dow for years to come.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAmerican Express's advantages are on full display\nAmerican Express issues its own credit cards, offers charge cards and personal loans, and collects processing fees. This is a drastically different business model from Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which are pure-play payment processors. Visa and Mastercard are less risky because they work with banks and financial institutions to issue cards. However, American Express has more growth potential, which was showcased in its latest quarter.\nAmerican Express's revenue net of interest expense rose by 11%, diluted earnings per share by 19%, and it reduced its share count by 2% compared to the third quarter of 2024. American Express raised its full-year 2025 forecast, with revenue growth of 9% to 10% and earnings per share of $15.20 to $15.50 compared to adjusted EPS of $13.35 in 2024. That's earnings growth of about 15% -- which would be a fantastic year for American Express.\nAmerican Express cardholder spending is rising\nPerhaps the most important metric from the third-quarter 2025 report was an 8% foreign exchange-adjusted increase in card member spending. On the earnings call, American Express Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri attributed the uptick in cardmember spending to strong retail engagement and a rebound in travel. He also said that the company's credit performance continued to be excellent -- showcasing its ability to manage risk with low net write-off rates.\nDuring the quarter, American Express launched its refreshed Platinum cards for U.S. consumers and businesses. The cards include higher fees but more perks, which can be a win-win for American Express and its card members. Squeri said the following on the earnings call:\nI'm very pleased to say that the initial customer demand and engagement are exceeding our expectations. In fact, while it's still early, this is the strongest start we've seen for a U.S. Platinum card refresh. Before I get into more details on Platinum, I want to provide some context. We are fortunate to have a global premium customer base that is unmatched in the industry, and our goal is to provide our customers with the best experience in the industry.\nThe solid increase in card member spending, paired with the successful launch of the new Platinum card, showcases American Express's advantages in today's bifurcated economy. Broadly speaking, consumer spending on discretionary goods and services, and even staples, is under pressure from relatively high interest rates and rising living costs.\nBy catering to an affluent consumer base and charging high card fees, American Express's customer base isn't as stressed by the rising cost of living. In fact, the upticks in spending may be partly due to higher asset prices, from stocks to real estate and gold. So, even though high interest rates and home prices hav"

Near all time highs but low volume notable.\n- DAX: Flat to slightly positive; German bund yields stable near recent lows.\n- CAC 40: Similar pattern; defensive sectors outperform.\n- Drivers:\n- No major Eurozone macro data today.\n- ECB rate expectations unchanged; markets pricing cuts mid-2026.\n- Geopolitical tone (Ukraine peace signals) weighing on oil, supporting risk sentiment.\nGermany (DAX)\nGermany 40 is trading near 24,288.5 after rejecting the upper trendline close to 24,482.2, signaling a loss of bullish momentum. The chart shows a break below the ascending trendline, which had supported the rally from the late-November low. Fibonacci retracement levels highlight key zones: 78.6% at 24,118.7, 61.8% at 23,818.5, and 50% at 23,673.0. The inability to hold above the trendline suggests a potential corrective move toward 23,818.5 or 23,673.0 if selling pressure persists. A decisive recovery above 24,118.7 would be required to restore bullish control and target the previous high at 24,482.2.\nMomentum indicators reinforce the weakening outlook. MACD is flattening near the zero line, indicating fading bullish momentum and a possible bearish crossover. Stochastic RSI at 30.49 is near oversold territory, hinting at a short-term bounce but without confirmation. If price fails to hold above 23,818.5, downside targets include 23,349.8 and the prior swing low at 22,489.4. The technical bias has shifted to neutral-to-bearish unless price reclaims 24,118.7 decisively, making the next sessions critical for trend validation.\nCommodities\n- Oil: WTI ~$57.8, Brent ~$60.6, both down ~2\u20133% on Ukraine peace progress headlines.\n- Gold: Takes a breather to ~$4,460 after running up to ~$4,550. Silver Spot also down ~5.5% to ~$75 after briefly breaking through ~$82.\n- Agricultural: Mixed; corn and wheat flat, cocoa and cotton slightly higher.\nBonds\n- U.S. Treasuries: 10-year ~4.13%, 2-year yields slightly lower; curve stable.\n- German Bunds: Yields near recent lows; no major moves expected today.\n- UK Gilts: Flat; liquidity thin.\nKey News\n- Ukraine peace talks optimism pressuring crude and defensive companies.\n- No major economic releases in U.S. or Eurozone today.\n- Fed and ECB policy expectations unchanged; rate cuts priced for mid-2026.\nOutlook for Today\n- Equities: Quiet, low-volume trade; mild positive bias in Europe.\n- Commodities: Oil to remain under pressure; metals sideways possibly taking a short breather.\n- Rates: Stable; no catalysts until January.\n- Volatility: Expected to remain low.\nUpcoming\n- Dec 30: Continued thin trade; year-end rebalancing.\n- Jan 2: Full reopening; U.S. and Eurozone data flow resumes; focus on Q4 earnings and central bank tone.\nSafe Holidays,\n-Philip Papageorgiou \u2013 Market Analyst\n--X ex Twitter: PhilipForexCom\nStoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

If we can break above that level, then it is likely that we could go looking at the 25,000 Euro level.\nShort-term Pullbacks and Economic Factors\nShort-term pullbacks, I think, remain buying opportunities in a market that has been consolidating for six months after a vertical move to the upside. Short-term pullbacks that break down below the 50-day EMA could go looking at the 23,500 Euro level, maybe even the 200-day EMA, which is closer to the 23,300 Euro level.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nThe floor in the market currently is 23,000 Euro, and as long as we can stay above there, I don't know that anything has changed. It will be interesting to see how DAX behaves at the beginning of the year because, of course, it has been so range-bound; we need some type of external factor to get things going. Whether or not the DAX can take advantage of that remains to be seen, as economic numbers in the European Union are okay, but not necessarily great. A lot of this could come down to the money that the German government is going to be pouring into the country's manufacturing sector via expenditure bills, but so far, that has not been enough to get the DAX really rocking to the upside. I do think that 2026 ends up being a positive year, though.\nReady to trade our stock market forecast and analysis? Here are the best CFD stocks brokers to choose from."

                "body": "Synopsys, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock wasn't much affected by its recent lackluster earnings numbers. We did some analysis and found some concerning details beneath the statutory profit number.\nTo understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. Synopsys expanded the number of shares on issue by 24% over the last year. As a result, its net income is now split between a greater number of shares. Per share metrics like EPS help us understand how much actual shareholders are benefitting from the company's profits, while the net income level gives us a better view of the company's absolute size. You can see a chart of Synopsys' EPS by clicking here.\nA Look At The Impact Of Synopsys' Dilution On Its Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nSynopsys has improved its profit over the last three years, with an annualized gain of 38% in that time. Net profit actually dropped by 7.3% in the last year. Unfortunately for shareholders, though, the earnings per share result was even worse, declining 13%. And so, you can see quite clearly that dilution is having a rather significant impact on shareholders.\nIn the long term, if Synopsys' earnings per share can increase, then the share price should too. But on the other hand, we'd be far less excited to learn profit (but not EPS) was improving. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\nAlongside that dilution, it's also important to note that Synopsys' profit was boosted by unusual items worth US$597m in the last twelve months. We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable. We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature. And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'. Synopsys had a rather significant contribution from unusual items relative to its profit to October 2025. As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.\nOur Take On Synopsys' Profit Performance\nTo sum it all up, Synopsys got a nice boost to profit from unusual items; without that, its statutory results would have looked worse. On top of that, the dilution means that its earnings per share performance is worse than its profit performance. For the reasons mentioned above, we think that a perfunctory glance at Synopsys' statutory profits might make it look better than it really is on an underlying level. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Synopsys at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Synopsys you should know about.\nOur examination of Synopsys has focussed on certain factors that can make its earnings look better than they are. And, on that basis, we are somewhat skeptical. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Synopsys might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) recently posted soft earnings but shareholders didn't react strongly. We did some analysis and found some concerning details beneath the statutory profit number.\nTo understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. As it happens, Synopsys issued 24% more new shares over the last year. As a result, its net income is now split between a greater number of shares. To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to per share value. You can see a chart of Synopsys' EPS by clicking here.\nHow Is Dilution Impacting Synopsys' Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\nAs you can see above, Synopsys has been growing its net income over the last few years, with an annualized gain of 38% over three years. Net profit actually dropped by 7.3% in the last year. But the EPS result was even worse, with the company recording a decline of 13%. So you can see that the dilution has had a fairly significant impact on shareholders.\nIf Synopsys' EPS can grow over time then that drastically improves the chances of the share price moving in the same direction. However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\nAlongside that dilution, it's also important to note that Synopsys' profit was boosted by unusual items worth US$597m in the last twelve months. We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. Which is hardly surprising, given the name. We can see that Synopsys' positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to October 2025. As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be."

                "source": "ESPN",

                "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Brian Flores delivered a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 game as the football world watched on Christmas Day. The question now is simple: What will he do with it?\nFlores' contract as the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator will expire after this season. NFL rules allow coordinators to break their deals if they are offered a head coaching job, but Flores' situation will allow him to explore his coordinator options around the league as well. There are no indications that either Flores or the Vikings are eager to part ways, and Flores enjoys wide latitude and significant personnel influence in Minnesota. But the franchise must brace for the possibility that it will lose one of its top assets.\n\"He's one of the smartest guys when it comes to schemes that I've ever been around,\" cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. said. \"So he can't go anywhere. He's not allowed to go anywhere. No way. I know that everything happens for a reason, and it's always God's plan. But I definitely do not want him to go anywhere. I re-signed here last offseason and told him that he's one of the best coaches that I've been around, and that I wanted to come back and play for him. I don't want him to go anywhere.\"\nFlores continues to operate one of the NFL's most unique schemes, one that has evolved this season to incorporate safety Harrison Smith as a quasi-playcaller on the field. On Thursday, the Vikings dismantled the Detroit Lions' offense, forcing six turnovers, sacking quarterback Jared Goff five times and producing a defensive success rate of 71% -- their second highest in a game since Flores arrived at the start of the 2023 season.\nAmid a season lost long ago to poor quarterback play, the Vikings have evened their record at 8-8. Their defense, which ranks No. 8 in the NFL in defensive EPA per play, is the primary catalyst. In retrospect, coach Kevin O'Connell and Flores flipped a switch during the Week 6 bye as they prepared to reinsert quarterback J.J. McCarthy into the starting lineup.\n\"Our dialogue, was, 'Hey, let's just make sure we're being as aggressive as possible,'\" O'Connell said. \"And that's how [Flores] is by nature. But then also the element of Harrison being able to have a role in what we ultimately play when the ball gets snapped. And he's got an unbelievable feel of the system. ... He's really out there playing a game within the game. And it's been spectacular to watch.\n\"But you learn about each and every year. Teams are different and you learn that you might have to win different ways.\"\nAfter blitzing at a rate of 31.4% before their bye week, the Vikings have blitzed on 51.8% of their defensive snaps since. But Flores has done it in new ways and combinations, in part by relying on Smith to apply the knowledge he has absorbed in his 14-year career to break playcalling tendencies and capitalize on what coaches can't always see from the sideline.\nSmith missed the Vikings' first two games because of a personal health issue that arose during training camp, and he didn't get back to his full-time role until Week 7 -- the same time the Vikings elevated their aggressiveness. Since that point, Flores has regularly -- not on every play, but many -- given Smith the authority to change coverages and blitz alignments before the snap.\n\"Early in the year we were figuring out exactly what our individual roles were,\" Smith said. \"And there was a lot of good, but it wasn't quite as tight. And then we've gotten maybe a little more aggressive in some things. And I think it's more just the belief in that. Without getting too into detail, it's a scheme that most guys have not come up playing with these rules and these techniques and stuff.\"\nNFL coaches often give quarterbacks a series of plays to choose from on offense, but it's less common on defense. Speaking earlier this month about the arrangement, Flores said he first thought about the possibility while coaching now-retired safety Devin McCourty when they were with the New England Patriots in the late 2010s.\n\"I was"

Some policymakers think rates are still too low once inflation is factored in, keeping the door open to further tightening. Others warned against moving too fast and pushed for flexibility.

                "body": "Here\u2019s why the Nikkei 225 Index jumped in 2025 and the top gainers\nThe Nikkei 225 Index did well this year, rising from a low of \u00a531,145 in April to a record high of \u00a552,590. It rose by nearly 30% this year, outperforming most global indices like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, and the German DAX.\nWhy the Nikkei 225 Index soared\nThe Nikkei 225 Index surged this year, even as the Bank of Japan maintained its hawkish tone and Japan bond yields soared to the highest level in decades. Data shows that the ten-year bond yield jumped to a multi-year high of 2.10%, while the five-year soared to 1.54%.\nThe index jumped because of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, which benefited some of the biggest players in the industry, like Advantest and Softbank.\nAdditionally, it jumped because of the falling Japanese yen, which continued its freefall during the year. The USDJPY exchange rate rose from a low of 139.87 in April to a high of 157.83.\nA weaker Japanese yen benefits the Nikkei 225 Index by helping its biggest exporters, including automakers like Toyota, Mazda, and Honda. Other large industrial companies like Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric also benefited.\nMeanwhile, like other indices, the Nikkei Index jumped after Donald Trump signed a trade agreement with Japan, which reduced tariffs for goods from the country. This deal brought the levies to 15%, down from over 30%, with Japan promising to invest billions of dollars in the United States.\nTop gainers and laggards in 2025\nMost companies in the Nikkei 225 Index did well this year. Sumitomo Dainippon, a giant player in the pharmaceutical industry, soared by 311% this year, bringing its market capitalization to over $4.35 billion. This surge happened as the company made progress on its pipeline and as the turnaround gained steam.\nMitsui Mining & Smelting stock price jumped by 286% this year, with its valuation hitting over $7 billion. This surge happened as commodity prices continued soaring, with gold, silver, and copper gaining momentum. The jump benefited this company as it provides engineered materials used in the mining industry.\nFujikura share price soared by 173%, with its valuation jumping to $36 billion as demand for its technology products rose. Advantest, a top player in the semiconductor industry, rose by 116%, while Sumitomo Electric rose by 123%.\nJapanese bank stocks also did well as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) hiked interest rates during the year. Shizuoka Bank stock rose by 90%, while Concordia Financial, Mizuho, Chiba Bank, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial jumped by double digits during the year.\nMeanwhile, Softbank\u2019s stock price jumped by 90% this year. Recently, however, the stock has dropped by over 35% this year as concerns about the AI bubble have remained.\nOn the other hand, the top laggards in the Nikkei 225 Index in 2025 were companies like Itochu, KDDI, Bridgestone, Daiichi Sankyo, and Recruit Holdings, which dropped by over 20%."

                "body": "Outlook 2026 Series | VI. Japan\u2019s \u201cTakaichi Trade\u201d: Big Fiscal Stimulus Raises Growth Hopes\u2014and Debt Concerns\nJapan\u2019s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, wasted no time unveiling a massive \u00a521.3 trillion stimulus package, sparking a market rally now dubbed the \u201cTakaichi Trade.\u201d Her policy approach\u2014centered on aggressive fiscal spending and easing\u2014has drawn comparisons to Abenomics.\nParadoxically, Japan\u2019s latest fiscal package relies on heavy subsidies to curb inflation. Unlike previous expansions supported by aggressive easing, this stimulus coincides with a rate-hiking cycle. This shift has reignited concerns over debt sustainability, pushing 10-year JGB yields above 2% for the first time in two decades\u2014even as the Yen remains weak.\nMeanwhile, Japanese equities continue to hover near record highs. Looking toward 2026, the key trajectory for the Yen and the Nikkei depends on one question: Can Japan leverage the AI and semiconductor boom to complete its economic transformation, or will structural headwinds persist? This report analyzes these critical drivers.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Takaichi\u2019s stimulus boosted stocks, but with the yen weakening and yields surging, the economy isn\u2019t yet in a virtuous cycle.\n- Japan faces three structural headwinds: weak corporate investment, aging demographics, and low AI adoption.\n- We analyze both short- and long-term outlooks for Japanese equities and the yen.\nTakaichi vs. Ueda: A Policy Split Ahead of 2026\nWith Takaichi\u2019s cabinet in place, the policy focus has shifted to \u201cresponsible and proactive fiscal policy.\u201d At the same time, the BOJ raised rates by 25 bps to 0.75% on December 19\u2014the highest in 30 years\u2014highlighting a growing divergence between fiscal and monetary policy.\nFiscal Plan: Estimated to Add 0.5pp to GDP Growth in 2026\nThe Takaichi government\u2019s \u00a521.3 trillion stimulus package focuses on three pillars:\n- Cost of Living Support: \u00a511.7 trillion to offset rising prices. Measures include scrapping the gasoline tax surcharge, reviving energy subsidies, and boosting wage support.\n- Strategic Investment: \u00a57.2 trillion for 17 priority sectors like AI, semiconductors, and quantum tech.\n- Defense & Diplomacy: \u00a51.7 trillion to strengthen national security.\nBeyond this supplementary FY2025 budget, markets are watching the upcoming FY2026 initial budget, expected to exceed \u00a5120 trillion\u2014another record high.\nBOJ Tightening Likely to Slow in 2026\nWhile fiscal policy expands, the BOJ is cautiously tightening. After hiking rates in December, the central bank is facing persistent inflation\u2014November\u2019s CPI was 2.9%, with core inflation (excluding food and energy) higher than in the U.S.\n**We expect the BOJ to\nAlready a subscriber?
