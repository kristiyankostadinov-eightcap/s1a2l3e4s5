                "body": "US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) ended Wednesday's trading session in mixed territory after the Federal Reserve's latest decision to hold interest rates steady at its January FOMC meeting.\nYahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre breaks down the biggest market themes from today\u2019s trading day, including the latest price surge in gold (GC=F), possible market headwinds to come in 2026, and the negative moves in the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB)\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.\nWe got to start with the ho-hum action in stocks and you can see that was a very choppy chart that we had in the Dow. So, what am I saying here? Stocks shrug, but gold surges. So, let's go back and take a look at a few more charts. In fact, just to highlight this again, I haven't seen a Feb announcement day this choppy, this quiet in some time. That's just the Dow. You can see it closed barely in the green up 12 percentage points.\nThere's the Nasdaq, there's the S&P 500. But let's go to gold. and that was just on a tear. Even for gold standards, it was uh gold standard. It was up uh almost 6% and I went back and according to some measures and depends on how you slice and dice and put put together the futures contracts, but haven't seen a move like this since March 19th of 2009. You know what was happening back then? Very beginning, just a few days into QE1.\nAnd that just kind of tells you the strength of the move here. Let's check out the year to date and you can see it's up 25%. In fact, only a few days ago, it was uh it was up quite a bit lower. Let me just go to the 10 day because I think it'll only cross the 5,000 mark. Yeah, that was last week somewhere in there. So it is just on a tear. and it's not just gold, of course, it's silver too. That's is uh if it's not a record high today, it's very close.\nBut also in the upper left, PA equals F, that's palladium. And if we go to the year-to-date totals on all of these, you can see silver up 65%, platinum up 26, and gold just behind, uh palladium up 25 as well. And the upper left though, that's 99%, that's natural gas. Natural gas prices for February delivery have more than doubled this year, but that's kind of an outlier because of the weather.\nSo beyond the here and now my friend, you're looking farther out to 2026. You're wondering, what are some potential pain points I got to have on my radar? You would say what?\nYes, I was just asking that very same question to Steve Steve Sosnik. He's the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. And this is for an episode of Stocks and Translation, a podcast that comes out Tuesday morning. But here's what he had to say about one of these headwinds this year.\nIt's a mid-term election year. We've had two down years in the last 10. Care to guess when they were? You mentioned one of them, 2018, the other one was 2022. What do they have in common? Mid-term election years. We had obviously a big, you know, sort of bear market moves in 2020, obviously. And again, last year with with liberation day, but uh in terms of lasting down years, those were the two.\nAnd he had a he had quite a list there. Not just midterm elections, also the market is pricing in a number of Fed rate cuts, probably going to get a disappointment on that front. Uh new Fed chair, a lot of times when we have a new Fed chair, they are tested early. in 2018, Fed chair Powell came in, right away he was tested with Volmageddon in February, look that one up and also a near bear market in December of that year when he mentioned autopilot with respect to uh what was that? quantitative tightening.\nAlso, a weaker dollar and we're going to get into the dollar in a second. That can be inflationary. So, you know, kind of goes both ways there. But also we are in the fourth year of this bull market. That's another one. AI spending concentration risk and then rates. Uh we might actually have longer-term rates shooting up and that would be a headwind "

                "body": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady at 3.50% to 3.75%, attempting to project an image of stability as the U.S. financial landscape splits into two jarring realities: a stock market at record heights and a currency under pressure.\nThe decision, widely expected by 97% of investors, arrived just as the S&P 500 crossed the psychological 7,000-point threshold for the first time in history. But the euphoria in equities\u2014\u201cAMERICA IS BACK!!!\u201d President Donald Trump cried on Truth Social\u2014was matched by a move in the opposite direction for the greenback. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has shed more than 10% of its value over the past year, sliding further after Trump signaled late Tuesday a multiyear low for the currency was \u201cgreat.\u201d The U.S. dollar index rebounded slightly on Wednesday as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC: \u201cThe U.S. always has a strong dollar policy.\u201d\nIn its policy statement, the Fed said economic activity has continued to expand at a \u201csolid pace,\u201d though job gains are low, and the unemployment rate has shown signs of stabilizing. Inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee said, \u201cremains somewhat elevated.\u201d While acknowledging some progress on price pressures, officials emphasized that they still require \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target before resuming the rate-cutting cycle that defined the end of 2025.\nThe Fed also underscored increased uncertainty around its outlook and said it would attend to both sides of the mandate.\nThe central bank, however, now finds itself in a precarious bind. While a weaker dollar theoretically aids U.S. exports, it complicates the Fed\u2019s mandate by threatening to, in effect, import inflation and also rattle critical foreign investors needed to fund a massive U.S. deficit.\nNela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, told CNBC the dollar\u2019s decline is a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\n\u201c[It] does make U.S. exports more competitive abroad, but a weak dollar at home doesn\u2019t always have the confidence of markets,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that confidence is going to be very important as we look at other things that are a struggle for the U.S. economy, like sticky inflation, like high deficits and debts, and the need to sell Treasuries, both domestically and abroad.\u201d\nThat confidence crisis is already showing up in households. Consumer sentiment crashed in January to 84.5, a 12-year low that places American morale below the miseries of the 2020 lockdowns. That disconnect between a stock market at 7,000 and a pessimistic public facing a \u201clow-hire, low-fire\u201d labor market for the better half of the past year, continues to fuel concern over the \u201cK-shaped economy.\u201d\nDissent at the Fed\nThe internal rift at the Fed remains unresolved since December\u2019s meeting, which produced the most formal dissents since 2019. Two officials\u2014Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller\u2014dissented from Wednesday\u2019s decision, preferring that the Fed lower the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nExtra eyes are on Waller\u2019s verdict, since he is a rumored finalist for the chairmanship after Jerome Powell\u2019s term is up in May. Analysts have suggested a vote from Waller in favor of interest rate cuts, aligning with the president\u2019s browbeating demands for lower borrowing costs\u2014could be seen as a bellwether for his candidacy.\nTrump is expected to name the successor as early as this week, with prediction markets currently favoring Rick Rieder, BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder, who has no prior experience within the Federal Reserve system, has recently seen his odds on Polymarket surge to 55% following positive remarks from the White House. However, the prediction markets have been extremely volatile, and recent reports say it is still very much up in the air who Trump will choose.\n\u201cMarkets aren\u2019t focused on today\u2019s decision alone,\u201d Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone, wrote in a note. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on leadership path"

                "body": "Gold, silver prices hit record highs as US-Iran tensions drive haven demand\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its weekly report on crude oil inventories, revealing a significant drop in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by US firms. The actual number came in at a decrease of 2.295 million barrels, a stark contrast to the forecasted slight dip of 0.200 million barrels.\nThis unexpected decrease in crude inventories implies a greater demand for oil, a bullish signal for crude prices. Analysts had forecasted a minor decrease, but the actual figures surpassed these expectations, indicating that the demand for crude oil may be stronger than previously thought.\nComparing the actual decrease of 2.295 million barrels to the forecasted decrease of 0.200 million barrels, the actual number is more than ten times the forecasted number. This significant difference suggests that analysts may have underestimated the current demand for crude oil in the market.\nFurther comparison to the previous number, which was an increase of 3.602 million barrels, shows a significant shift in the trend. The move from an increase to a substantial decrease indicates a considerable change in the dynamics of the crude oil market.\nThe level of inventories influences the price of petroleum products, which can have an impact on inflation. With the unexpected decrease in inventories, we could potentially see a rise in the price of petroleum products. This could have a ripple effect on inflation, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.\nThe EIA\u2019s Crude Oil Inventories report is a critical indicator of the health of the oil industry and broader economy. The unexpected decrease in inventories, implying greater demand, could be a positive sign for the oil industry. However, the potential impact on inflation will be something to watch in the coming weeks.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                "body": "USD/JPY, EUR/USD Forecast: Dollar finds a floor as policy pushback emerges\n- ECB officials push back against euro strength\n- US rules out intervening to support the yen\n- Dollar rebound driven by positioning, not conviction\n- Intervention risk rising for USD/JPY\nSummary\nMarkets finally found a reason to pause the dollar rout, but not one built on conviction. Pushback from ECB officials and mixed messaging from Washington acted as a release valve on USD weakness, triggering sharp reversals in EUR/USD and USD/JPY before quickly fading. With Japan left to defend the yen alone and euro strength increasingly clashing with the ECB\u2019s inflation mandate, the next phase looks less about policy promises and more about whether officials are prepared to back words with action.\nECB officials lean against euro strength\nThis shift in tone was most evident in Europe, where policymakers wasted little time responding to renewed euro strength. It didn\u2019t take long for a barrage of dovish commentary from European officials once EUR/USD punched above the 1.20 mark, with ECB Governing Council member Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau noting Wednesday that he is \u201cclosely monitoring this appreciation of the euro and its possible implications for lower inflation\u201d, flagging that the stronger currency\u2019s impact on prices will be a key factor \u201cin the months ahead\u201d. While the ECB publicly insists it does not target exchange rates, it is clear policymakers are alert to the risk that further euro strength could place additional downward pressure on inflation, which is already expected to undershoot its 2% target based on its latest forecasts.\nDoubling down on the dovish tone, Austria\u2019s central bank governor Martin Kocher told the Financial Times that if the euro continues to strengthen to the point it materially weighs on inflation forecasts, \u201cat some stage this might create\u2026a certain necessity to react in terms of monetary policy\u201d. Kocher said any response would be driven by the inflation outlook rather than the exchange rate itself, noting there is no immediate need to adjust rates but that policymakers should retain \u201cfull optionality\u201d amid uncertainty. In short, if euro strength blunts the inflationary impulse from abroad, the ECB could yet find itself back in easing mode.\nUS shuts the door on yen support\nAcross the Atlantic, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent poured cold water on speculation of coordinated FX action, stating the U.S. is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d intervening to support the yen and reiterating Washington\u2019s commitment to a strong dollar policy. His remarks contradict comments from Donald Trump less than a day earlier welcoming recent declines in the dollar as \u201cgreat\u201d, extending the now familiar good-cop, bad-cop dynamic within the administration. The result, once again, was mixed messaging that generated two-way volatility across markets.\nStepping back, Bessent\u2019s comments suggest reported rate checks in USD/JPY conducted by the New York Fed late last week were likely undertaken on behalf of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance rather than the U.S. Treasury. That implies Japan is attempting to stem yen weakness on its own, without U.S. backing. History suggests that approach can prove problematic unless Tokyo is prepared to back its warnings with action, including putting its money where its mouth is and instructing the BOJ to intervene directly.\nThe remarks from both sides of the Atlantic acted as a relief valve on USD weakness. The move was assisted by a slightly more hawkish FOMC statement, which nudged up its growth assessment while downside risks to the labour market were notably absent. With short-term positioning stretched after the recent dollar plunge, the rebound gathered momentum before fading during Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference, which failed to deliver any meaningful hawkish surprises.\nJapan\u2019s intervention credibility under scrutiny\nOf all the key macro developments overnight, Bessent\u2019s remarks towards the yen were perhaps the most telling, likely e"

The US Dollar (USD) remains weak against the Euro (EUR) amid uncertainty over US economic policies. The Eurozone Consumer Confidence and US Initial Jobless Claims reports are due later on Thursday.\nTraders remain concerned over US President Donald Trump's erratic policymaking and the Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, which drags the USD lower and acts as a tailwind for the major pair. The US president said on Tuesday that he will announce his pick for the new Fed Chair soon. Trump added that interest rates will significantly drop as soon as a new Fed chair is at the helm.\nThe US central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged in a range of 3.5%-3.75% at its January policy meeting on Wednesday. During the press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the outlook for economic activity has improved since the last meeting and that the labor market has shown signs of stabilizing, but also noted signs of continued cooling.\nFed officials signaled a more cautious approach to potential future rate reductions. Markets expect the Fed to wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again. A hawkish hold from the Fed could help limit the US Dollar\u2019s losses in the near term.\nAcross the pond, economists widely anticipate the European Central Bank (ECB) to keep rates steady at its upcoming February meeting and through at least mid-2026. The central bank indicated that rates are in a \"good place\" to ensure medium-term price stability.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for th"

                "body": "Early this morning, ECB's Kocher said that if the euro were to appreciate further and further, at some stage that might create a certain necessity to react in terms of monetary policy. Not because of the exchange rate itself, but because the exchange rate translates into less inflation, and this becomes a monetary policy issue.\nLast year, ECB's Vice President de Guindos said that 1.20 on the EUR/USD exchange rate is something they can tolerate, but anything above that would complicate the outlook for them.\nECB's Villeroy has also commented on the euro this morning saying that the ECB is closely monitoring the currency and its effect on inflation. He added that they have no target for the exchange rate but the euro is one element that will guide their policy.\nIt looks like they are trying to jawbone a bit here. Policymakers don't like fast, one-sided moves and we just went from 1.1576 to 1.2082 in less than two weeks. Of course, that was all about the dollar as USD/JPY intervention risks and Trump's actions weighed on the greenback.\nI personally think this move is overdone absent new catalysts because it was more about the intervention risk than something fundamental. If we get strong US data next month, the market should pare back the 48 bps of easing priced in by year-end and provide support for the dollar. On the other hand, if we get soft data, the greenback will likely remain under pressure as dovish bets would keep weighing on it.\nIf the euro strengthens too much and we get soft Eurozone inflation data in the next months, then we can expect traders to price in another rate cut from the ECB. On the other hand, a weak dollar with stocks at all-time highs and loose financial conditions, could lead to a re-acceleration in US inflation and eventually to a policy divergence between the Fed and the ECB."

The Federal Reserve (Fed) held interest rates steady, as many investors broadly anticipated, but the Fed\u2019s rate statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell both failed to give any hints about potential shifts toward future rate cuts, which many investors broadly hoped.\nWith the Fed\u2019s first rate call of the year out of the way, attention now shifts to political central bank matters. US President Donald Trump has been soft-rolling towards announcing a new Fed Chair pick to replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Key Trump officials have been drumming up anticipation for the president\u2019s next pick, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinting that Trump\u2019s list of potential candidates, which has allegedly been whittled down to just one name, could come within the next week.\n\u201cThe next week\u201d has been a popular catch-all bin for Trump officials to lump policy expectations into, and typically means anytime between several weeks to several months. President Trump, who selected Jerome Powell as head of the Fed during his first term, has been on an on-again, off-again warpath to have Powell replaced early after the Fed failed to deliver rapid-fire interest rate cuts upon request from the White House.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade"

Check our detailed guide-\nSterling has a clear runway due to dollar weakness and solid domestic data. December retail sales rose 0.4%, easing recession fears and suggesting that UK consumers are coping with high borrowing prices better than expected. These numbers have prompted the Bank of England to rethink its aggressive easing cycle, which runs counter to the Fed\u2019s policy.\nThe pair\u2019s momentum is boosted by global macro trends that favor commodities and high-beta currencies over the dollar. Gold prices have reached record highs, and new US tariff threats are disrupting global trade, making the pound a significant beneficiary of capital rotation out of dollar-denominated assets. UK inflation remains at 2.1%, supporting the Bank of England\u2019s cautious stance and the pound\u2019s yield advantage.\nMarkets are increasingly focused on the FOMC press conference in the late New York session. Any evidence that the Fed caves to political pressure to cut rates might break the 1.4000 resistance level. On the other hand, if Powell remains data-dependent and hawkish, traders may cover short dollar positions, reversing the sterling rally.\nGBP/USD Technical Forecast: Buyers Aiming for 1.4000\nThe GBP/USD price broke above the 1.3800 level, marking a fresh 4-year top at 1.3860 before correcting down to the 1.3790 area. The broken supply zone around 1.3800 is now acting as support, with projections pointing to a test of the swing high at 1.3860, then 1.3900, and finally the psychological level at 1.4000.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about South African forex brokers?

The pair appreciated after hotter-than-expected Australian inflation data, released on Wednesday, lifted the odds of a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate hike as early as next week.\nMarkets now price in over a 70% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) hike by the RBA from the 3.6% cash rate, up from 60% before the release, with rates fully priced at 3.85% by May and around 4.10% by September.\nAustralia\u2019s CPI rose by 3.8% year-over-year (YoY) in December, following a 3.4% increase prior. The market consensus was for 3.6% growth in the reported period. Australia\u2019s RBA Trimmed Mean inflation increased to 0.2% month-over-month (MoM) and 3.3% year-over-year (YoY). The monthly CPI rose 1.0% in December, up from 0% previously and above the 0.7% forecast.\nAustralia\u2019s export prices rose 3.2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in Q4 2025, rebounding from a 0.9% fall in Q3 and marking the first increase in three quarters, as well as the strongest gain in a year. Meanwhile, Import prices climbed 0.9%, beating expectations for a 0.2% decline and reversing a 0.4% drop in Q3.\nThe upside of the AUD/USD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the US commitment to a strong USD policy. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept interest rates unchanged at its January meeting on Wednesday, pointing to still-elevated inflation and resilient economic growth.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell noted during the post-meeting press conference that job gains have moderated and the unemployment rate has shown signs of stabilization, adding that the Fed is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to assess incoming data on a meeting-by-meeting basis and remains off a preset path for future rate decisions.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting "

                "body": "Australian Dollar extended its rally this week, with AUD/USD breaking above 0.70 psychological level. The move has been supported by broad-based Dollar weakness, but domestic factors have played a central role following Australia\u2019s stronger-than-expected inflation data.\nDecember CPI showed another month of acceleration, while Q4 headline inflation printed at 3.6%. More importantly for policymakers, trimmed mean CPI at 3.4% underscored persistent underlying inflation that sits uncomfortably above the RBA\u2019s target band. That inflation shock has quickly filtered into economist forecasts. Westpac and ANZ revised their outlooks, now expecting the RBA to raise the cash rate at its upcoming meeting next week. All four major Australian banks now forecast a 25bp hike back to 3.85%.\nThe key uncertainty now lies beyond the initial move. The question is whether the RBA would signal scope for a more extended tightening cycle, or frame the hike as a one-off adjustment designed to reassert inflation control.\nTechnically, AUD/USD remains in clear upward acceleration, with D MACD still pointing higher. The advance from 0.5913 is on track toward its 100% projection of 0.5913 to 0.6706 from 0.6420 at 0.7213 next. On the downside, below 0.6901 support will bring consolidations first. But downside should be contained above 0.6706 resistance turned support to bring another rally.\nMore importantly, the decisive break above 0.6941 structural resistance this week strengthens the case that the rise from 0.5913 is reversing the entire decline from the 0.8006 (2020 high). Next target is 61.8% retracement of 0.8006 to 0.5913 at 0.7206, which is close to the above 0.7213 projection level.\nReactions to this 0.72 resistance zone will decide whether current rise from 0.5913 is the third leg of the pattern from 0.5506 (2020 low), and open the door to further medium up trend through 0.8006."

Rising Australian bond yields, and a wea..\nker US dollar, can amplify that move by making AUD assets look more attractive to global investors.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Higher yields can ripple across assets.\nWhen traders suddenly reprice the path of RBA rates, the currency, bonds, and rate-sensitive stocks tend to move in sync. A more hawkish tone could keep supporting the aussie, while pressuring sectors that rely on cheap funding, like property and highly leveraged companies. The flip side is that if the RBA signals it\u2019s near done, the currency\u2019s rally can fade quickly as yield differentials narrow.\nZooming out: Not every central bank is on the same schedule.\nAfter a year of \u201cwho cuts first\u201d debates, Australia is starting to look like an outlier \u2013 at least temporarily.

The rebound comes as investors remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision expected later in the day.\nThe US Dollar came under heavy pressure on Tuesday following comments from US President Donald Trump, who said that a weaker US Dollar was \u201ca good thing\u201d and that the currency was simply seeking its own equilibrium level. These remarks reinforced concerns about political tolerance for a softer currency, adding to the pressure on the Greenback, which is already weighed down by expectations of future rate cuts.\nMarkets widely expect the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged in the 3.50%-3.75% range. Money markets assign a chance close to 95% to a hold, following three consecutive 25-basis-point cuts delivered last year. The focus will be firmly on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference, as his remarks are expected to provide guidance on the future path of interest rates. Several major banks believe the central bank will emphasize a wait-and-see approach, even as markets continue to price in two rate cuts later this year.\nSince the last Fed meeting, US macroeconomic data have broadly supported the view that the central bank can afford to remain patient. Inflation is easing only gradually, while labor market conditions remain relatively resilient, reducing the urgency for further monetary easing. However, any signal of a prolonged pause could provide additional support to the US Dollar.\nOn the Japanese side, the Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to draw structural support from the evolving monetary policy outlook. Minutes from the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) December meeting showed that policymakers are increasingly confident in the sustainability of wage growth and underlying inflation, justifying a gradual continuation of monetary tightening. This backdrop helps limit Japanese Yen losses, despite persistent concerns over Japan\u2019s fiscal position and political uncertainty ahead of the snap election scheduled for February 8.\nConcerns surrounding government spending plans and tax cuts in Japan continue to weigh on the domestic currency, alongside a generally positive risk environment. These factors help underpin USD/JPY in the near term, although the growing divergence between a more hawkish Bank of Japan and a Federal Reserve that may lean toward rate cuts could, over the medium term, restore some appeal to the Japanese Yen.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Is USD on the Verge of a Major Break After Trump Cheers Dollar Weakness?\nCurrencies are unique as an asset class and for many traders and quite a few investors, that nuance is difficult to explain. After all, the aim of trading currencies is the same as stocks or gold or palm oil or anything else: To use risk capital in an attempt to profit, and along the way taking risk that could erase some or all of that capital. But as far as the underlying assets go currencies are unique from those other markets in several ways, chief of which is the fact that all of those other markets are priced in the very same currencies that are being traded on FX platforms.\nThis is why spot FX is often traded in pairs: Because the only way to value a currency \u2013 is with another currency. So if you ask someone the value of the Euro there\u2019s not an easy direct response, you then need to ask, \u2018against which currency?\u2019\nCommonly in the FX world the default is the major pair, which is the pairing of the currency in question with the US Dollar. And in many ways the USD is the center of both the FX universe and western capitalism, which global trade often settled in the US currency. The USD is also considered as \u2018the global reserve,\u2019 and that title allows the US certain benefits, such as control over other countries and trade partners that can allow for leverage when levying sanctions.\nThis is somewhat controversial and far from the point of this article, but what is in the equation at the present is the USD\u2019s role in the global economy, as for years it\u2019s seemed that general policy was to avoid any direct engagement of strength or weakness drives even if other trade partners were doing so.\nJapan is a key example, and this is something that former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had commented on without seeming to do anything about it. But with a backdrop of decades of deflation and disinflation and an aging population that\u2019s only going to continue to decrease, Japan has been somewhat desperate to drive economic growth in their economies. This hit home in 2012, with the election of Shinzo Abe and his \u2018Abe-nomics\u2019 platform designed to put growth front-and-center for the Japanese economy. As part of the strategy there were multiple components, but a big part of that approach was weakening the Yen to help boost exports.\nBy doing so, the value of USD/JPY rose from the 80\u2019s into the 120\u2019s and, in essence, made it easier for Japanese companies to sell products in the United States. The other side of that, however, is that it made it more difficult for US companies to compete and if we\u2019re looking at a market like automobiles, that can have an outsized impact on the economy in the United States.\nFor US policymakers it seemed that this was largely tolerated as assistance to a key trade partner. But since President Trump\u2019s inauguration a year ago, this has been a major focal point as he\u2019s attempted to get that dynamic reversed to help US companies. This drove a massive wave of USD-weakness in the first-half of last year and he\u2019s been back on the topic with aggression even as the DXY sell-off stalled in the second-half.\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD: Where\u2019s the Weakness Going to Come From?\nGetting back to that unique element of FX and the fact that the only way you can value a currency \u2013 is with another currency, and there\u2019s a conundrum of sorts. And it\u2019s perhaps less obvious in the US Dollar basket or the DXY basket as it trades as a singular asset, similar to gold or stocks or anything else. But \u2013 the DXY basket is really just a basket of underlying currencies \u2013 so if we are going to see a trend in either direction for the Dollar, it\u2019s going to need assistance from the currencies in that basket.\nThe Euro is the largest component at 57.6%, so many times when we see a USD trend there\u2019s a mirror image trend in the Euro. The Japanese Yen is the second largest component at 13.6%, so when we see something like"

Weakness in the yen is supporting gains in the dollar today after Treasury Secretary Bessent said the US \"absolutely not\" intervening in the currency market to support the yen. Market movement is limited ahead of the FOMC decision later today.\nThe dollar sank to a nearly 4-year low on Tuesday after President Trump said he's comfortable with the recent weakness in the dollar. Also, the dollar continues to be undercut as foreign investors pull capital from the US amid political risks. The markets remain nervous about Greenland, even though Mr. Trump said last Wednesday that there was a framework agreement for increased US access to Greenland and that he would not invade Greenland by military force.\nJoin 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.The dollar is also under pressure on US political uncertainty after President Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs on US imports from Canada if Canada signs a trade agreement with China. Canada is seeking other trade partners amid President Trump's liberal use of tariffs during this second administration.\nIn addition, the dollar is weighed down by speculation that the US might coordinate FX intervention with Japan to boost the yen, which would dovetail with Mr. Trump's apparent view that a weak dollar is good for the US as a stimulus to US exports. The yen rose to a 2.75-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as US authorities reportedly contacted market participants last Friday to check dollar/yen prices, a possible precursor to intervention.\nThe risk of another partial US government shutdown is also weighing on the dollar. Senate Democrats threatened to block a government funding deal over Department of Homeland Security/ICE funding after the ICE shooting of an ICU nurse in Minnesota on Saturday. There could be a partial government shutdown when the current stopgap funding measure expires this Friday. In addition, the dollar is being undercut by risks to the Federal Reserve's independence, a growing US budget deficit, fiscal profligacy, and widening political polarization.\nThe markets are discounting the odds at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut at the conclusion of today's FOMC meeting.\nThe dollar continues to see underlying weakness as the FOMC is expected to cut interest rates by about -50 bp in 2026, while the BOJ is expected to raise rates by another +25 bp in 2026, and the ECB is expected to leave rates unchanged in 2026.\nEUR/USD S is up by +0.98% today. The yen is falling back from Tuesday's 2.75-month high against the dollar. Today's rally in the Nikkei stock index to a 1.5-week high has reduced some safe-haven demand for the yen. Also, higher T-note yields today are bearish for the yen. Losses in the yen accelerated today after US Treasury Secretary Bessent said the US is \"absolutely not\" intervening in the forex market in support of the yen.\nThe yen had rallied sharply over the past few sessions on speculation that US-Japan joint FX intervention may be forthcoming. US authorities reportedly called major banks last Friday to request dollar/yen quotes, a possible precursor to intervention. Also, Japanese Finance Minister Katayama said Tuesday that officials \"will take action\" in line with a US-Japanese FX agreement.\nThe minutes from the December 18-19 BOJ meeting showed some board members expressed rising concern over the extent to which the yen's depreciation is affecting price trends, saying that \"in deciding whether to raise the policy interest rate, the BOJ should give consideration to the impact of the yen's depreciation on inflation rates, and in some cases, on underlying inflation.\"\nThe markets are discounting a 0% chance of a BOJ rate hike at the next meeting on March 19.\nFebruary COMEX gold (GCG26) today is up +152.80 (+3.01%), and March COMEX silver (SIH26) is up +6.993 (+6.60%"

With no big change in guidance, investors didn\u2019t meaningfully reprice where rates go next, so the currency barely reacted. The Bank also kept the door open to more easing later this year without promising anything. That leaves USD/CAD less about Canada\u2019s rate path and more exposed to US data, Federal Reserve exp..\nectations, and broad swings in the greenback.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: USD/CAD is still mostly a US dollar story.\nING thinks the \u201cUSD leg\u201d is doing most of the work \u2013 meaning broad moves in the US dollar can outweigh Canada-specific news like a steady policy rate. If the recent US dollar pullback fades, that alone could lift USD/CAD, even if the Bank of Canada stays cautious and predictable. Translation: currency volatility may come more from Washington and Wall Street than from Ottawa.\nThe bigger picture: Trade talks are the wildcard for the loonie.\nING also points to eventual USMCA renewal negotiations as a potential pressure point. Canada\u2019s economy is tightly tied to US demand and cross-border supply chains, so any sign of friction can raise the risk premium investors demand to hold Canadian assets. That kind of headline risk can weigh on the currency even if growth and inflation forecasts stay broadly steady.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "USD/CAD slide to 1.3530, lowest since October 2024 amid bullish Oil prices and weak USD\n- USD/CAD drifts lower for the third straight day on Thursday and is pressured by a combination of factors.\n- Crude Oil prices climb to a four-month top and underpin the Loonie amid the BoC\u2019s neutral policy stance.\n- The uncertainty over Trump's decisions, Fed independence concerns, and rate-cut bets weigh on the USD.\nThe USD/CAD pair attracts some follow-through sellers for the third consecutive day and drops to its lowest level since October 2024 during the Asian session on Thursday. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.3540-1.3535 region, down 0.15% for the day, and seem vulnerable to decline further amid a combination of factors.\nCrude Oil prices rise to a four-month high due to rising geopolitical risks and continued Chinese buying. Furthermore, a surprise decline in US inventories offsets concerns about oversupply and remains supportive of elevated prices. This, in turn, underpins the commodity-linked Loonie, which, along with a bearish US Dollar (USD), continues to exert downward pressure on the USD/CAD pair and validates the near-term negative outlook.\nThe USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, remains well within striking distance of a four-year low amid heightened economic and policy risk linked to US President Donald Trump's decisions. Apart from this, bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs during the latter half of 2026 and the underlying bullish sentiment weigh on the safe-haven buck, contributing to the USD/CAD pair's slide.\nAs was widely expected, the US central bank left its key policy rate unchanged at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. In the post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the incoming data had shown a clear improvement in the economic outlook. Traders, however, are still pricing in two more interest rate cuts by the Fed in 2026. Moreover, concerns about the Fed's independence keep the USD bulls on the defensive.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Canada (BoC) said that elevated levels of economic and geopolitical uncertainty were behind its decision to hold interest rates for the second time on Wednesday. The BoC added further that the uncertainty is bleeding into economic predictions, which now run from cuts to hikes to holds for 2026. The outlook, however, does little to influence the Canadian Dollar (CAD), leaving the USD/CAD pair at the mercy of the USD.\nTraders now look to the release of the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, which could influence the USD demand. Apart from this, Oil price dynamics might contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities around the USD/CAD pair. Nevertheless, the aforementioned fundamental backdrop remains tilted in favor of bearish traders and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside.\nUS Dollar Price Last 7 Days\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies last 7 days. US Dollar was the strongest against the Canadian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "The Canadian dollar rose against most major currencies during Wednesday\u2019s trading, supported by the central bank\u2019s monetary policy statement.\nThe Bank of Canada decided today to keep the overnight interest rate unchanged at 2.25%, while maintaining the lending rate at 2.5% and the deposit rate at 2.20%, in a move reflecting its continued cautious stance amid a globally uncertain economic environment.\nThe bank said that the outlook for the global and Canadian economies has not changed materially from the projections in the October Monetary Policy Report, though risks remain elevated due to unpredictable US trade policies and ongoing geopolitical developments.\nThe bank noted that economic growth in the United States continues to exceed expectations and is likely to remain strong, driven by AI-related investment and consumer spending. While tariffs are contributing to higher US inflation, their impact is expected to fade gradually later in the year. In the euro area, growth has been supported by activity in the services sector, with additional fiscal support expected, while China\u2019s GDP growth is projected to slow gradually as domestic demand weakens, despite strong exports. Overall, the bank expects global growth to average around 3% over the forecast horizon.\nOn financial markets, the bank said global financial conditions remain broadly accommodative. Recent weakness in the US dollar has helped lift the Canadian dollar above 72 US cents, close to the level seen around the October report. Oil prices have also been volatile due to geopolitical events and are expected to be slightly lower in the period ahead compared with the assumptions in the previous report.\nDomestically, US trade restrictions and elevated uncertainty continue to weigh on growth. After a strong performance in the third quarter, GDP growth is likely to have stalled in the fourth quarter. Exports remain under pressure from US tariffs, while domestic demand is showing signs of improvement. Although employment has increased in recent months, the unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.8%, with only a small share of firms indicating plans to hire additional workers.\nThe bank expects economic growth to remain modest in the near term as population growth slows and Canada adjusts to US protectionist policies. Consumer spending is likely to remain resilient, while business investment is expected to improve gradually, partly supported by fiscal policy. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.1% in 2026 and 1.5% in 2027, broadly in line with the October projections. The review of the Canada\u2013US\u2013Mexico Agreement remains a key source of uncertainty.\nOn inflation, the consumer price index rose to 2.4% in December, driven by base effects related to the GST/HST tax holiday last winter. Excluding tax-related changes, inflation has continued to slow since September. The bank\u2019s preferred core inflation measures declined from 3% in October to around 2.25% in December. Inflation averaged 2.1% in 2025, and the bank expects it to remain close to the 2% target over the projection period, with trade-related cost pressures offset by excess supply.\nThe Bank of Canada reiterated that monetary policy remains focused on keeping inflation close to 2% while supporting the economy through this period of structural adjustment. The Governing Council sees the current policy rate as appropriate, provided the economy evolves broadly in line with today\u2019s projections. However, the bank stressed that uncertainty remains high and that it is closely monitoring risks, reaffirming its readiness to act if the economic outlook changes and its commitment to maintaining Canadians\u2019 confidence in price stability amid ongoing global disruptions.\nIn trading, the Canadian dollar rose against the US dollar at 20:51 GMT, gaining 1% to 0.7367.\nElevated spot metal prices suggest that 2026 could be one of the strongest profit years in recent memory for diversified mining companies, with Rio Tinto and Glencore emerging as th"

                "body": "GBP/JPY extends the range play below 211.00, close to multi-week low amid mixed cues\n- GBP/JPY struggles to gain any meaningful traction and remains close to a multi-week low.\n- Fiscal concerns and political uncertainty weigh on the JPY, lending support to spot prices.\n- The divergent BoJ-BoE policy expectations cap the intraday uptick and favor bearish traders.\nThe GBP/JPY cross extends its sideways consolidative price move for the second straight day and trades below the 211.00 mark during the early European session on Wednesday. Spot prices remain close to a five-week low, touched on Monday, though the mixed fundamental backdrop warrants caution before placing aggressive directional bets.\nInvestors remain concerned about Japan's fiscal health on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's aggressive spending and tax cut plans. Adding to this, domestic political uncertainty ahead of a snap election on February 8, along with a positive risk tone, undermines the safe-haven JPY and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross. However, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook and intervention fears help limit deeper JPY losses.\nIn fact, the December BoJ meeting minutes released earlier today showed that members were more confident about sustaining a moderate wage\u2013price cycle and were using that assessment to justify another step toward less accommodative policy. This, in turn, highlights the central bank's readiness to continue pushing up still-low borrowing costs. In contrast, traders are pricing in one or possibly two quarter-point rate interest cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) in 2026.\nApart from this, a goodish US Dollar (USD) recovery is seen exerting downward pressure on the British Pound (GBP), which further contributes to capping the GBP/JPY cross. However, the range-bound price action following a bearish gap opening on Monday makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for an extension of the corrective pullback from the vicinity of the 215.00 mark, or the highest level since July 2008, touched last week.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Po"

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped to around 45.7 after retreating from overbought territory, suggesting bullish momentum is fading. At the same time, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has eased to near 25.9, pointing to a loss of trend strength.\nOn the downside, price action is currently stabilizing above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near 209.70. A sustained break below this level would expose the 100-day SMA around 205.70, which closely aligns with the lower boundary of the rising channel.\nA decisive daily close below the channel would signal a deeper corrective phase, potentially opening the door toward the 200.00 psychological handle.\nOn the upside, the 21-day SMA near 211.80 is capping immediate recovery attempts. Failure to reclaim this zone would keep near-term risks tilted to the downside.\nConversely, a clear break above it could attract fresh buying interest, allowing a retest of the double-top region near the channel top, with scope for an extension to new highs if bullish momentum re-accelerates.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in."

I also recognize that we need some of the noise to soften in the yen denominated markets overall in order to get large with the position.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nThe US dollar is struggling quite a bit more against the yen than the British pound, but that makes sense considering the US dollar has its own concerns. That is why I\u2019m focusing on this pair, because I\u2019m trying to match up strength with inherent weakness. Yes, the central banks may have done something, but that\u2019s not the sign of a strong currency; quite frankly, it\u2019s mainly the opposite that it gives an impression of.

                "body": "It's been about two years since spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started trading in the U.S., marking a seminal event in the histories of both the ETF industry and the broader cryptocurrency space.\nOne of the most significant funds in this still young ETF category is the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB 0.34%). Just a couple of weeks past its second birthday, the ARK ETF is home $3.3 billion in assets under management (AUM), meaning just five crypto ETFs of any variety are larger than this fund.\nThat's an impressive start for any two-year-old ETF, and it confirms that advisors and retail investors alike are embracing this product. Still, that popularity also indicates that market participants, particularly those new to the game, need to understand the mechanics of spot Bitcoin ETFs, including this ARK fund. Here are three need-to-know facts about this fund.\n1. Investors own shares, not Bitcoin directly\nThe ARK Bitcoin ETF and its brethren are comparable to funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares in that investors buy shares in a fund that provides exposure to the underlying asset. However, investors purchasing this ETF don't directly own Bitcoin any more than a gold ETF investor owns gold bars, which is to say they don't.\nIn fact, the ARK ETF is, at its core, an index fund as it tracks the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate \u2013 New York Variant. Prospective investors need to remember that point.\n2. Unlike Bitcoin, the ETF doesn't trade all day\nFor many investors, one of the coolest things about cryptocurrency is that it's a true 24/7 market. Want to buy some Bitcoin or another digital currency at midnight or on Christmas Day? No problem. Your order will be processed, and you'll immediately add to your Bitcoin stake.\nThat's not the case with the ARK fund or any other Bitcoin ETF, for that matter. Remember what ETF stands for. These are funds that trade on exchanges, meaning any ETF can only be bought or sold when the exchange is open.\nNYSEMKT: ARKB\nKey Data Points\nAnd because we're talking about an ETF here, there's an expense ratio to consider. The ARK fund charges 0.21% annually, or $21 on a $10,000 investment. While the fee is nominal, it may be off-putting to experienced crypto investors accustomed to holding digital currencies in their own wallets or on exchanges where fees simply for holding aren't part of the equation.\n3. Cathie Wood is a Bitcoin bull\nPut this in the \"for what it's worth\" column, but ARK co-founder and CEO Cathie Wood is a longtime Bitcoin bull. Optimistic investors considering the firm's Bitcoin ETF may view Wood's support of the digital currency as naysayers view it as her talking her book. That call should be made on an individual basis.\nWhen it's said the ETF issuer is bullish on Bitcoin, it's really bullish. ARK forecasts a total cryptocurrency market capitalization of $28 trillion by 2030, implying a more than ninefold increase from the current level of $3.01 trillion.\nIt expects Bitcoin will represent 70% of that figure, or $19.6 trillion. Not only is that more than four times Nvidia's market cap, but that prediction implies the largest digital currency is in for an 11x run from current levels."

                "body": "Combine the biggest ETF manager, one of the hottest trends in ETF investing, and a new product launch, and what do you get? Meh.\nThere\u2019s nothing bombastic or shameful about the planned iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, due to debut soon. And it certainly has a solid firm behind it. Covered call ETFs, including active ones, are not new. And frankly, I find the product glut downright dangerous.\nI\u2019m not pointing fingers at any one firm. It is the sum total of option-driven income strategies that feel way too familiar. All the rage today, boatloads of arbitration cases later. I just don\u2019t know when. I also don\u2019t ignore the risk that there\u2019s just too much covered call writing chasing too little liquidity. Not in the current happy-time market. When it gets tougher. And volume blows out. And equities fall\u2026 and don\u2019t come back so quickly.\nRemember, the last time we had anything approaching a slow dripping market decline was 2022. And even that was all of 9 months before the AI rally began. We have to go all the way back to 2008 to find an environment where covered call ETFs failed more than temporarily. This is likely to happen again, I just don\u2019t know when.\nWhat\u2019s the Skinny on the Latest Covered Call ETF?\nBlackRock\u2019s new Bitcoin (BTCUSD) fund is an actively managed ETF that does two things simultaneously:\n- Holds Bitcoin: It is backed by actual Bitcoin held in cold storage by Coinbase Custody.\n- Generates Income: It writes (sells) call options primarily on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).\nIn plain English: This is a \u201cBuy-Write\u201d or \u201cCovered Call\u201d strategy for Bitcoin. It\u2019s designed for the investor who wants Bitcoin exposure but is tired of the stomach-churning volatility and wants to get paid a monthly premium while they wait.\nStrengths and Weakness: It\u2019s Not All Bad, But It\u2019s Not All Good\nWhy Now?\nBlackRock filing this in January 2026 tells me it believes the \u201cWild West\u201d era of 100% volatility is maturing. It is targeting the registered investment advisor (RIA) market, the folks who want to put 3% of a client\u2019s portfolio in Bitcoin but can\u2019t handle a 50% drawdown without an income stream to point to.\nThe Bottom Line for me is that this filing is the white flag of volatility. It\u2019s the sign that Bitcoin is being domesticated into a traditional asset class. It\u2019s great for retirees and income-seekers, but for the \u201cdiamond hands\u201d crowd, it\u2019s a distraction. This is not the first of its kind. But when iShares gets in, there\u2019s a sense of legitimacy.\nAnd for this product, that\u2019s the case. But when Bitcoin falls and can\u2019t get up, then what? That\u2019s when covered call writing\u2019s downsides set in. So as with most such products, my only interest in them is if I can hedge the downside using a put option (essentially completing a collar) or even an inverse ETF on the same or similar type of security.\nBut those are observations, not suggestions. This product overload in covered call writing just strikes me as a poster child for this era in history.\nRob Isbitts is a semi-retired fiduciary investment advisor and fund manager.

If a tokenized security is of substantially similar character and confers substantially similar rights and privileges, it may be treated as the same class for certain purposes under federal securities laws, regardless of format.\nThe only difference, it said, is that \u201cinstead of maintaining the master securityholder file through conventional, off-chain database records, the issuer (or its agent) maintains the master securityholder file on one or more crypto networks.\u201d\nThe statement comes as the federal agency has shifted its stance on crypto under the Trump administration, dropping or closing more than a dozen cases over the past year, including actions against major crypto companies that turned on whether tokens, staking products, or wallet infrastructure constituted unregistered securities.\nWhile the guidance reinforces that securities laws apply regardless of technological format, it\u2019s the same legal framework underpinning many of the cases the agency had abandoned.\nBut Wednesday's statement sidesteps the harder question those cases have raised on whether crypto-native products like tokens and staking programs are deemed securities in the first place.\nEthereum illustrates the unresolved boundary that the statement leaves untouched. In 2024, Consensys revealed in an unredacted lawsuit that the SEC had, in March 2023, authorized an internal investigation into \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d issuing a formal order that explicitly treated Ethereum as a security.\nThe probe, approved by the Commission the following month, stood in contrast to public comments from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who repeatedly declined to state whether the agency viewed ether as a security. The SEC later closed its Ethereum-related investigation without bringing enforcement action and declined to comment on its decision.\nThe SEC appears to have softened its general stance on crypto, but is still actively pursuing cases, such as those involving Bitcoin mining services, which it claims constitute securities offerings.\nDisclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.\nThe staff statement is \u201csaying, very clearly, \u2018tokenization changes nothing legally\u2019\u2014but the unspoken reality is that tokenization changes everything operationally, and the existing securities framework is not built for on-chain market structure,\u201d Andrew Rossow, public affairs attorney and CEO of AR Media Consulting, told Decrypt.\nThe SEC staff\u2019s statement also does not answer \u201cwhether on-chain ledgers can replace or legally equal traditional books and records,\u201d Rossow explained.\n\u201cThink of this from the overarching infrastructure. If a blockchain is the de facto cap table or bond register, but the SEC still requires transfer agents, registered custodians, and broker-dealers, then the blockchain is legally ornamental, not authoritative,\u201d he added.\nWhile the SEC appears to be \u201cenforcing \u2018technology neutrality\u2019 while relying on technology-specific assumptions,\u201d Rossow said, \u201cneutrality at the classification level masks non-neutrality at the operational level.\u201d\nThe SEC\u2019s staff stateme"

Earlier in the session, the S&P 500 hit the 7000 level for the first time.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up 0.3%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 ended fractionally higher and lower, respectively, after the Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 to leave interest rates unchanged at a range of 3% to 3.75%. (Read our live coverage here.)\nAt a press conference following the central bank's decision, outgoing Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, \"We still have some tension between employment and inflation, but it's less than it was.\" Powell, who has faced heavy criticism from President Donald Trump for failing to cut rates, was asked by a reporter what advice he'd give his successor and said, \"Stay out of elected politics.\"\nEarlier Wednesday, the S&P 500 hit a new all-time high for a second straight session, while the Nasdaq approached its record set on Oct. 29 before pulling back.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury\u2014which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages\u2014was little changed from Tuesday's close of 4.25% at 4 p.m. ET.\nSafe-haven gold futures surpassed $5,300 an ounce early Wednesday and recently were up about 6% to above $5,385. Silver futures were surged more than 10% to above $117 an ounce, near their record high set Monday.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of global currencies, was slightly higher at 96.39 after reaching more than four-year lows yesterday. Bitcoin was slightly higher on the day at around $89,400. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, were up 1.5% to around $63.35 a barrel.\nInvestors were gearing up for quarterly results from megacap tech firms Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA) after the closing bell.

                "body": "Global markets presented a mixed picture on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, as U.S. indices diverged ahead of major economic news. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500, which briefly touched the historic 7,000-point barrier for the first time, traded slightly lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slightly up. The day\u2019s muted, split action highlights a market in a holding pattern, cautiously awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision and a slate of key technology company earnings reports. Meanwhile, Indian markets rallied strongly for a second day, propelled by optimism from a new trade agreement with the European Union.\nU.S. Market Snapshot (as of Jan 28)\nS&P 500: A Historic Touch at 7,000\nThe broader S&P 500 index briefly crossed the historic 7,000-point threshold for the first time in history, reaching an intraday high of 7,002.28. This landmark moment underscores the market\u2019s underlying strength and bullish long-term sentiment. But by the middle of the session, the index had lost those gains and was trading little down. Its behavior serves as a gauge for a market that is hopeful but reluctant to commit prior to significant news events, falling between the Dow\u2019s gain and the Nasdaq\u2019s slight decline.\nDow Jones: A Modest Rebound\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.08%, marking a modest recovery from its previous session\u2019s 0.86% decline. The blue-chip index\u2019s performance suggests a degree of stability and selective buying in more traditional industrial and financial sectors. This recovery suggests that, as investors reevaluate risks ahead of the Fed\u2019s speech, the steep, healthcare-driven sell-off from the previous day\u2014led by stocks like UnitedHealth Group\u2014may have found short-term support.\nNasdaq: Tech Pauses Before Big Earnings\nThe Nasdaq Composite dipped slightly by 0.04%. This halt comes as investors prepare for earnings releases from major giants including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla after the market closes, following a robust 0.90% increase in the previous session. While the larger tech sector seemed to consolidate its gains while awaiting new catalysts from corporate results and the Fed\u2019s direction, the early session was bolstered by strength in semiconductor stocks following favorable reports from companies like Texas Instruments.\nWhat\u2019s Driving the Cautious, Split Market?\nThe mixed signals from the major U.S. indices point to a market carefully balancing several powerful forces:\nThe Federal Reserve in Focus: The dominant theme for the day is the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision. Investors are universally on hold, parsing every word for clues on the future path of inflation and rate cuts. This event has the power to redefine market direction for weeks to come.\nEarnings Season Crosscurrents: Early positive results from chipmakers fueled initial optimism, particularly around AI-related investments. But for the mega-cap tech reports that are due after the bell, the market is currently in \u201cwait-and-see\u201d mode. While disappointments could lead to a wider decline, strong results could rekindle the rise.\nA Stable Geopolitical Setting: Unlike the last session when U.S.-Iran tensions clearly drove markets (lifting gold to record highs), today\u2019s trading suggests those worries have eased. Other stories now dominate as investor focus has decisively shifted toward company fundamentals and domestic monetary policy rather than global political flashpoints.\nIndian Markets: Strong Rally on Trade Deal Optimism\nIndian markets continued their upward path, clearly outperforming global peers for a second straight day today. The rally was firmly driven by ongoing optimism around the newly finalized India-EU Free Trade Agreement.\nIndex Performance Summary (as of Market Close, Jan 28)"

This marks the first time since July that rates have not been adjusted, despite significant pressure from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs further.\nThis decision follows a series of rate reductions in September, October, and December of the previous year. The move is expected to frustrate President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more aggressively, even suggesting that rates should be as low as 1%.\nLast month, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced rates to their lowest level in three years, responding to concerns about rising unemployment and a softening labor market. On Wednesday, Jerome Powell noted that while inflation remains somewhat high, the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong and unemployment levels are stabilizing. However, he cautioned that the housing sector continues to struggle.\nOngoing disputes between President Trump and Chair Powell have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, especially after the President\u2019s public criticisms. Earlier this month, the Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into Powell, a move he described as an attempt to undermine the central bank\u2019s autonomy. The investigation centers on a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed\u2019s headquarters, which has exceeded its budget.\nPowell asserted that the real motivation behind the probe is the Fed\u2019s refusal to set interest rates according to the President\u2019s preferences, warning of the dangers of political interference. Central bankers worldwide, along with former Fed leaders and Treasury secretaries, have condemned the investigation.\nFormer Bank of England Governor Lord King recently warned that President Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed could push the U.S. economy toward a severe recession. He emphasized the risks of dismissing inflation concerns, noting that such complacency can lead to persistent inflation that may only be resolved through a deep economic downturn.\nThe investigation into Powell follows Trump\u2019s attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook over unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud, a case now before the Supreme Court. Powell described this legal battle as potentially the most significant in the Fed\u2019s 113-year history.\nPowell defended his decision to appear alongside Lisa Cook at the Supreme Court, despite criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Powell explained that he felt it would be difficult to justify not attending such a pivotal hearing.\nWith Powell set to step down in May, he is expected to oversee two more interest rate decisions before a new chair is appointed by President Trump.\nMarket Response:\nWhen asked for guidance for his successor, Powell advised, \u201cStay out of politics. Don\u2019t get drawn into political disputes.\u201d\nPowell noted that American households are tightening their budgets due to affordability challenges. Retailers serving lower-income customers report that consumers are opting for less expensive brands and reducing overall spending. Powell emphasized the Fed\u2019s awareness of these concerns.\nPowell stressed the importance of maintaining the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, warning that losing public trust in the institution\u2019s impartiality would be difficult to recover. He reaffirmed his and his colleagues\u2019 dedication to this principle.\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s announcement, U.S. stock indices experienced modest declines. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 6,970 points after surpassing 7,000 earlier, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also edged down. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3%.\nPowell highlighted the urgent need to address the U.S. federal budget deficit, noting that running large deficits during periods of full employment is unsustainable and requires prompt action from policymakers.\nThere was broad agreement within the FOMC to keep rates unchanged, though Powell acknowledged ongoing t"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is once again the drama queen of Europe \u2013 a classic tug-of-war between cautious bears and comeback-hungry bulls. Instead of a clean one-way move, the index is locked in a choppy, emotional phase: pullbacks get bought, breakouts get faded, and every new macro headline from Frankfurt, Berlin, or Washington can flip sentiment in minutes. This is not a sleepy, low-volatility environment; this is where active traders live.\nRight now, the German benchmark is hovering in a crucial zone, where previous highs, psychological round-number marks, and moving average clusters all collide. That creates a technical battlefield: dip buyers see a potential launchpad for the next leg higher, while risk-off players are watching for a failed breakout that could morph into a deeper correction. In short: it is not a random range, it is a decision zone.\nThe Story: To understand the DAX 40 in early 2026, you have to zoom out beyond just candles and intraday spikes. The real driver is the macro cocktail: ECB policy, the euro versus the dollar, energy prices, and Germany\u2019s industrial pulse.\n1. ECB and Interest Rate Drama\nThe European Central Bank is still walking a tightrope: fight the last remnants of inflation without suffocating a fragile recovery. Markets are obsessed with every word coming from ECB officials, especially any hint about the timing and pace of rate cuts. If the ECB stays hawkish for longer than expected, growth-sensitive sectors like autos, chemicals, and cyclical industrials feel the pressure. If the tone softens and the path toward easier policy becomes clearer, you can expect a relief rally in European blue chips and high-beta names.\nFor DAX traders, ECB meetings are volatility events. Hawkish surprises typically trigger short-term selloffs, with financials and exporters wobbling as bond yields and FX expectations shift. A more dovish tilt, combined with an improving growth narrative, tends to support risk-on rotations into cyclical German names.\n2. Euro vs. Dollar: The FX Side-Quest\nThe DAX is packed with exporters: automakers, industrials, and global manufacturing champions that live and die by foreign demand and the currency rate. A weaker euro versus the dollar often acts as a tailwind for earnings, making German exports more competitive abroad. A stronger euro, on the other hand, can compress margins and cool enthusiasm for export-heavy stocks.\nCurrent FX action is a balancing act. The euro is not in a wild freefall, but it is also far from a one-way moonshot. For traders, that means the currency is more of a tactical factor than a single big trend. Sudden FX spikes around US data or Fed communication can still hit DAX futures quickly, so intraday traders watch both the euro-dollar chart and the index side-by-side.\n3. Energy Prices and the German Model\nGermany\u2019s economic narrative over the last years has been heavily shaped by energy costs and supply security. While the worst-case energy shock scenario is off the table for now, prices remain a structural wildcard. Elevated or unstable energy prices hit heavy industry first: chemicals, steel, manufacturing \u2013 exactly the backbone that traditionally powered the DAX.\nIf energy markets calm down and stabilize at bearable levels, that removes a major overhang and supports a slow grind higher in industrials. If energy flares up again due to geopolitical tensions or supply disruptions, you can expect renewed pressure on energy-intensive sectors and a broader risk-off tone in the index.\n4.

ECB: Higher For Longer, Or Quiet Pivot?\nAll eyes remain on the European Central Bank. Recent communication from Frankfurt has tried to walk a tightrope: acknowledge that inflation has cooled from its peak, but also stress that underlying price pressures and wage dynamics are still not fully tamed. Markets are constantly trying to front?run a dovish pivot, but the ECB knows that cutting too early could reignite inflation, especially with any new energy or geopolitical shock.\nFor the DAX 40, the ECB\u2019s tone is everything. When traders smell easier monetary policy ahead, rate?sensitive sectors such as industrials, autos, and real estate see renewed interest and dip buyers step in. When the ECB leans hawkish, the instant reaction tends to be risk?off: bank stocks can hold up for a while, but cyclical exporters get hit, and the index feels heavy.\n2. German Economy: Industrial Hangover, But Not Dead\nGermany\u2019s macro data is still painting a fragile picture. Manufacturing surveys have hovered in cautious territory, export orders are inconsistent, and energy costs remain a structural headache after the end of cheap Russian gas. At the same time, the narrative of a \u201cpermanent manufacturing collapse\u201d looks exaggerated.\nWe are seeing a messy, multi?speed transition: some traditional heavy industry is under pressure, but technology?driven segments, automation, and high?value engineering are still globally competitive. That nuance matters for the DAX, which is packed with world?class industrial and engineering names. When global risk appetite improves, international investors often use the DAX as a pure play on global trade and industrial recovery.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar: FX Headwinds Turned Tactical Tailwinds?\nThe euro\u2019s moves against the US dollar are another hidden driver of DAX sentiment. A softer euro typically boosts German exporters\u2019 competitiveness and can support earnings translated back into euros, while a strong euro tightens financial conditions and squeezes margins.\nRight now, the FX backdrop is more balanced than in the peak-energy-crisis phase. The euro is no longer in free?fall, but it is also not aggressively rallying. This keeps things nuanced: currency risk is still there, but not screaming in one direction. For equity traders, that means the euro is more of a tactical theme than a dominant trend driver. Sudden spikes in EUR/USD after US data or Fed commentary, however, still cause fast, algo-driven swings in the DAX.\n4. Sector Stories: Autos, Banks, and the Energy Overhang\nAutos: German automakers are under constant scrutiny. Slowing EV demand in some regions, price wars, Chinese competition, and regulatory pressure all hang over the sector. Yet on the flip side, auto names are deeply embedded in global "

Wall Street also braced for earnings from megacap tech companies in a day that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) vault briefly over the 7,000 mark for the first time.\nThe S&P 500 slipped fractionally from its record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed.\n(^DJI)\nThe Fed's first interest-rate decision of 2026 came and went as expected, as the central bank kept rates unchanged in a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, in a 10-2 decision. Governors Chris Waller and Stephen Miran dissented, voted in favor of a 25 basis point cut.\nThe spotlight now turns to Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference comments for clues about future cuts. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s decision, markets were pricing in two quarter-point rate reductions by the end of 2026, according to CME FedWatch.\nThe recent slump in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) raised questions over the potential risk of an economic downturn. The US currency rose Wednesday, after sinking to its lowest level since 2022 on Tuesday after President Trump brushed off the deepest drop in the dollar since his sweeping tariffs launched.\nThe rate decision also comes amid a period of political tension for the central bank, as the Trump administration in recent weeks opened a criminal investigation against Powell over his Senate testimony about renovations of the central bank\u2019s headquarters. Markets are also watching for Trump to announce Powell's successor, which Trump has said could happen any day now.\nMeanwhile, techs are in the spotlight again as a surprise record surge in orders for ASML's (ASML) chipmaking machines stoked optimism for a long-lasting AI boom. Shares in ASML turned lower, though the spirits boosted AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) and TSMC (TSM), which rely on the Dutch company's gear to produce chips.\nThe developments have turned up focus on earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META), which have invested heavily in an AI-focused data center buildout underpinned by those chips. The tech giants are scheduled to report results after the market close, alongside fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap Tesla (TSLA).

                "body": "In the clearest sign yet that Tesla is pivoting away from its electric car business, CEO Elon Musk announced on Wednesday\u2019s investor call that the company would discontinue production of its Model X SUV and Model S full-size sedan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe expect to wind down S and X production next quarter.\u201d\nThe model S and X factory in Fremont, California would be converted to produce Tesla\u2019s upcoming Optimus robot, Musk said.\nTesla\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report showed slumping vehicle sales and declining revenue as Musk pins the company\u2019s futures on AI and robotics. The earnings report described Tesla\u2019s chaotic year as a \u201ctransition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company\u201d.\nThe high hopes and grand possibilities Musk has outlined helped Tesla beat Wall Street expectations, even as the company reported its first-ever decline in total revenue \u2013 losing 3% year-over-year. Tesla reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.50 after the market close on Wednesday, exceeding the $0.45 that Wall Street expected. Its reported revenue was $24.9bn, beating analyst estimates of $24.79bn.\nThe company\u2019s total automotive revenues dropped 11% year-over-year in 2025. Earlier this month, Tesla reported its fourth quarter vehicle delivery numbers, which measure buyers\u2019 receipt of their cars rather than dealership sales, revealing a 16% decline year-over-year, hurt especially by cratering interest in Europe. The company\u2019s stock rose as high as 4% in after-hours trading, before tapering off its gains.\nAs Tesla\u2019s vehicle sales have fallen over the past year, Musk and the company have emphasized a shift towards AI-driven projects such as Optimus consumer robots and self-driving Robotaxis. All of these technologies remain unproven and not widely available to the public, let alone profitable, but they have allowed Musk to claim the company will see unparalleled future growth without much to show for it today.\nMusk has stated that Optimus would be the \u201cbiggest product of all time\u201d and said that the robots, along with autonomous vehicles, would usher in \u201ca world where there is no poverty\u201d. Tesla plans to start production of Optimus before the end of 2026, according to the earnings report. Musk has said the company will sell the robot to the public in 2027. Tesla also revealed that earlier this month it agreed to invest $2bn into xAI, Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company.\nTesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, stated on the earnings call that the company\u2019s capital expenditure would be $20bn, an immense amount that is vastly more than what many analysts estimated.\nAlthough Tesla\u2019s stock price plummeted during Musk\u2019s tumultuous time in government last year, it rebounded to its highest price ever in December amid ongoing market frenzy for AI investments and Musk\u2019s promise of building a \u201crobot army\u201d. The previous month, Tesla shareholders also approved a pay package for Musk that could award him up to a trillion dollars in compensation if the company meets a series of financial milestones.\nWhile Tesla has touted its upcoming projects as evidence of upcoming success, some of its formerly futuristic products have struggled. The company\u2019s Cybertruck, which Musk said earlier this month was \u201cthe best vehicle Tesla has ever made\u201d, saw a drastic 48% decline in sales last year, according to Kelley Blue Book reports.\nTesla has faced increasing competition from other electric vehicles companies, primarily China\u2019s BYD, which overtook Tesla last year as the world\u2019s largest electric carmaker. BYD\u2019s sales grew by 28% in 2025, as it offered consumers in a number of markets less expensive alternatives to Tesla\u2019s models."

                "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Tesla's annual profit plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic five years ago as it lost the title of the world's biggest electric vehicle maker to a Chinese rival and boycotts hammered sales.\nThe EV company run by Elon Musk reported Wednesday that net income last year dropped 46% to $3.8 billion. It was the second year in a row of steep declines. The drop came despite the introduction of cheaper models and Musk's promise to remain laser-focused on the company after a foray into U.S politics.\nStill, Tesla investors have kept the faith in Musk. The stock is up 9% in the past year.\nMusk has been urging investors to focus less on car sales and more on what he considers a bright new future of robotaxis ferrying millions in cars without drivers, or even steering wheels, and robots watering plants and taking care of elderly parents.\nOn a conference call, Musk said Tesla would be closing down production of two models, S and X, in the second quarter this year and converting a Fremont, California, factory to produce its Optimus robots.\nFor the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla's net income also plunged, down 61% to $840 million, or 24 cents. Excluding one-time charges, net income totaled 50 cents per share, compared to analysts' forecasts of 45 cents.\n\"They've got aging product that is less and less competitive as others manufacturers come out with new models, then there is the general brand destruction,\" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid. \"Musk's involvement in politics has turned off customers.\"\nOne bright point was Tesla's gross profit margins, which leapt to 20% last quarter from 16% a year ago.\n\"Tesla's ability to show improving profitably was a surprise,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \"I think that is the reason the stock is up now.\"\nGoldstein said he was also encouraged by plans outlined in Tesla's earnings report to roll out robotaxi service in Houston, Miami and five other cities in the first half of this year.\nInvestors cheered earlier this year when Musk shifted his focus back to the company after spending months as head of a government cost-cutting team in Washington. But it's not clear his attention will remain as undivided in the new year. He has plans to take his rocket company SpaceX public, possibly in June, in what many expect to be a blockbuster IPO that make him the world's first trillionaire - but also possibly distract him.\nThe latest Tesla figures are a setback for a company that had promised so much a year ago.\nAfter President Donald Trump was elected, investors pushed up the stock on a bet that his advisory role in the new administration would help the company. Instead it backfired. Customers angry with his work for Trump and his right-wing political stances boycotted the brand.\nMusk had also promised a year ago that European regulators would approve its partial self-driving software within three months, a potential big boost to Tesla sales there. But that didn't happen either.\nAnd investors were also excited about Teslas robotaxi service promising rides without anyone driving the car. But instead they got cars with supervisors inside to grab the controls in case something went wrong, though on this count there may be progress. Tesla recently said it was removing these safety drivers in Austin where it launched the service in June and has vowed to aggressively expand into other cities in the coming year.\nFor some on Wall Street that is enough to get excited about the company, and keep pushing the stock up.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's most bullish analysts, expects robotaxis will be in more than 30 cities by the end of this year, and that Tesla will capture 70% of the global market for self-driving cars in a decade.\nOthers are also excited about Tesla energy storage business, which posted strong numbers last quarter with revenues surging 25% to $3.8 billion. Tesla is benefiting from massive demand as datacenters sucking up energy are being built out"

He emphasized that the company is steering decisively toward autonomy and robotics, noting that the Fremont facility will become a high\u2011volume Optimus factory.\nThe decision aligns with a broader strategic pivot Tesla has signaled throughout its Q4 earnings disclosures\u2014one that reflects declining sales of its older luxury models, intensifying global EV competition, and a focus on emerging \u201cphysical AI\u201d products like robotaxis and humanoid robots.\nWhy is Tesla killing the Model S and Model X?\nTesla launched the Model S in 2013 and it debuted the Model X in 2015.\nThe Model S, in particular, did well commercially for a time, but both vehicles have been surpassed in recent years by Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y.\nMusk told investors on the Jan. 28 call that it was \"slightly sad, but it is time to bring the S/X program to an end.\"\n\"It's part of our overall shift to an autonomous future,\" he said. \"The only vehicles that we'll make will be autonomous vehicles, with the exception of the next generation Roadster.\"\nHow did the Model S and Model X sell?\nTesla sold 9,199 Model S vehicles in 2025, according to the website Goodcarbadcar.net. The company sold 80,702 Model X vehicles in 2025, according to the website.\nHere's how the vehicles' sales have fared in the past five years:\n- 2024 | Model S: 15,901 | Model X: 21,099\n- 2023 | Model S: 26,701 | Model X: 24,700\n- 2022 | Model S: 90,473 | Model X: 24,099\n- 2021 | Model S: 11,556 | Model X: 7,305\nAre any job losses expected at Fremont plant?\nDespite the end of S/X production, current reporting does not indicate layoffs tied to the transition. In fact, Musk told investors that Tesla expects to increase headcount at the Fremont factory as it ramps up production of the Optimus robot, according to CNBC.\nWhat is the Optimus program, and why does Musk say it\u2019s the future of Tesla?\nOptimus is Tesla\u2019s in\u2011development humanoid robot \u2014 a bipedal, autonomous machine designed to perform tasks ranging from factory labor to daily household duties.\nMusk has repeatedly touted Optimus as one of Tesla\u2019s most important long\u2011term bets, describing it as a cornerstone of the company\u2019s vision for a future built around autonomy, robotics and \u201cphysical AI.\u201d\nThis shift also reflects Musk\u2019s belief that driverless vehicles and humanoid robots will ultimately define Tesla more than cars ever did. In its shareholder messaging, Tesla has already framed itself as moving beyond automaking toward AI\u2011driven mobility and robotics products."

That pressure is showing up just as earnings season heats up in Japan and the US, with big tech results setting the tone for sentiment. At the same time, Microsoft\u2019s comments about record AI investment revived a familiar concern: industrywide capex could arrive faster than the profits. Still, chip-testing gear maker Advantest rallied after raising its full-year profit outlo..\nok, and its large index weight helped keep the broader dip relatively small.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency moves can rewrite earnings expectations.\nWhen the yen firms up, investors often mark down profit forecasts for globally exposed Japanese firms \u2013 even if nothing else changes. Thursday was also a reminder that index performance can hinge on a few heavyweights: Advantest\u2019s jump partly offset declines in other tech leaders. With central banks still focused on inflation, markets are less forgiving of \u201cspend now, monetize later\u201d stories, so AI-linked companies may see bigger swings around earnings.\nZooming out: AI is becoming a global capex cycle.\nBig US tech budgets ripple through supply chains worldwide, and Japan sits right in the middle thanks to its chip and factory-equipment champions. The key question for markets isn\u2019t whether AI is useful, but whether the returns arrive quickly enough to defend today\u2019s valuations and margin targets. Until that\u2019s clearer, currency shifts and guidance updates can matter as much as the underlying demand.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
