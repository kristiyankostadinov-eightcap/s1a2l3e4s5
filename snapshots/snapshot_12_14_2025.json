                "body": "Gold Rate News Today, Dec 13: Minimal Price Movement Across Major Metros\nGold prices have seen minimal movement today, December 13, evidenced by a minor Rs 1 increase in 22-carat gold prices across India\u2019s major cities. This slight shift reflects steady economic indicators and consistent demand. For investors, understanding the nuances of these gold price movements is crucial, especially considering gold\u2019s role as a hedge against inflation and market volatility. Let\u2019s explore how these trends are influencing the market and shaping investment strategies.\nGold Price Today: Steady Trends Across the Market\nOn December 13, 2025, the gold price today in India experienced a marginal increase of Rs 1 for 22-carat gold. Major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai saw this minimal change, marking an unusual steadiness in the usually fluctuating market. In Delhi, the 22-carat gold stood at Rs 54,200 per 10 grams (Delhi gold rate). This consistency suggests a balanced global supply and demand, influenced by moderate economic indicators and stable industrial demand across regions.\nFactors Influencing Gold Rate Fluctuations\nUnderstanding gold rate fluctuations requires examining several key factors. Globally, gold prices are impacted by U.S. dollar strength, interest rate changes, and geopolitical stability. Currently, the market exhibits a lack of volatility, contributing to minimal movement in gold prices. With stable economic data and slight shifts in inflation expectations, gold prices are holding firm. For Indian investors considering gold as an investment, these trends indicate a moment of stability, pivotal for long-term strategy planning.\nGold as an Investment: Strategic Insights\nGold remains a favored asset among Indian investors due to its ability to safeguard against inflation and currency depreciation. With the recent trends showing minimal variation in the gold price today, investors might evaluate their portfolios for rebalancing opportunities. Gold\u2019s stable performance offers a hedge against economic uncertainties, making it a reliable asset for risk-averse investors. For those tracking gold-related assets, maintaining a diversified investment approach that includes gold can provide significant resilience against market swings.\nFinal Thoughts\nToday\u2019s gold prices reflect a stable market backdrop, characterized by balanced demand and steady global economic conditions. For investors, this stability underscores the importance of a diversified investment strategy. As the gold market remains consistent, it becomes a strategic component for portfolio diversification. With tools like Meyka, an AI-powered platform, investors can gain insights into real-time financial trends, enhancing their decision-making process. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or new to gold, understanding these price dynamics is essential. Leveraging market data and predictive analytics can guide better investment choices in an ever-shifting financial landscape.\nFAQs\nGold rates are influenced by several factors, including currency value, interest rates, and geopolitical conditions. A strong U.S. dollar often means lower gold prices. Conversely, rising inflation or political instability can boost gold demand.\nGold is viewed as a strong investment due to its stability and historical value retention. It acts as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations, offering security in volatile market conditions.\nGlobal economic trends, such as changes in interest rates and inflation, impact gold prices. Stable economic conditions tend to keep gold prices steady, while fluctuations can lead to increased demand and price changes.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational purposes.

                "body": "Updated: Saturday, December 13, 2025\nGold is ending the week near the psychologically important $4,300 per ounce level after a powerful post-Fed rally pushed prices within striking distance of fresh all-time highs. With most major bullion trading paused for the weekend, the \u201cgold price today\u201d reflects Friday\u2019s late-session levels and the market\u2019s response to a softer U.S. dollar, shifting interest-rate expectations, and a renewed bid for defensive assets.\nBelow is what\u2019s moving gold right now, what major analysts are forecasting for 2026, and the technical levels traders are watching as markets reopen.\nGold price today: Where spot gold and futures stand\nGold surged this week following the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s latest rate cut and a wave of positioning that accelerated the move into Friday\u2019s close.\n- Spot gold (XAU/USD) pushed to a seven-week high of $4,353.56 on Friday before easing back, with FXEmpire noting the session ended around $4,299.38 and the market hesitating just below the record high near $4,381.44. [1]\n- Reuters reported spot gold at $4,293.43/oz late Friday, while U.S. gold futures settled at $4,328.3. [2]\n- Retail \u201clive price\u201d feeds continued to show gold near the same neighborhood on Saturday, with one widely used quote page listing gold around $138\u2013$140 per gram (roughly consistent with ~$4,300/oz). [3]\nThe key takeaway: gold remains elevated and very close to record territory, but traders have started to trim risk into the weekend after a sharp multi-session advance. [4]\nWhy gold is rising: The Fed cut\u2014and what comes next\nGold\u2019s rally is tightly linked to the U.S. rate outlook. On December 10, 2025, the Fed cut the federal funds target range by 25 basis points to 3.50%\u20133.75% and signaled it will be data-dependent on further moves. [5]\nImportantly for markets, the decision was unusually split:\n- Two officials preferred no change, while one preferred a larger 50 bps cut\u2014a sign of real debate about inflation versus growth risks. [6]\n- Reuters reported dissenting voices emphasizing inflation risks and the challenge of making decisions with incomplete data after the government shutdown disrupted releases. [7]\nThe Fed statement also reiterated that inflation \u201cremains somewhat elevated,\u201d while acknowledging job gains have slowed and unemployment has edged up\u2014conditions that can bolster gold when investors expect rates to fall or real yields to soften. [8]\nThe U.S. dollar and Treasury yields: A push-pull for bullion\nGold\u2019s strongest tailwind remains the weaker dollar trend, but late-week trading also showed the classic tug-of-war between gold and yields:\n- FXEmpire noted the 10-year yield rebounded to ~4.188% and the 30-year to ~4.852% into Friday\u2019s close\u2014pressuring non-yielding gold at the margin. [9]\n- At the same time, FXEmpire wrote that the dollar index was still on track for a third straight weekly decline and down more than 9% for the year, which helps underpin bullion demand. [10]\nIn practical terms: gold rallies when the market leans toward easier policy and a softer dollar, but it can stall temporarily when yields bounce\u2014especially heading into major U.S. data releases.\nFund flows are supporting gold\u2014even as physical buying gets harder at these prices\nInvestment flows: \u201cPaper gold\u201d demand stays firm\nOne of the most supportive signals for gold in mid-December is that money continues to rotate into precious-metals exposure:\n- Reuters reported gold and precious-metals commodity funds saw net inflows of $1.9 billion for a fifth straight week. [11]\nThat\u2019s consistent with a market where investors remain willing to buy dips\u2014especially with uncertainty around rates, inflation persistence, and geopolitics.\nPhysical markets: High prices are \u201ckilling the vibe\u201d in Asia\nOn the other side of the ledger, high prices are clearly dampening jewelry and retail demand in key hubs:\n- Reuters reported India\u2019s domestic gold prices hit a record (132,776 rupees per 10 grams) and that elevated levels have reduced footfall during we"

                "body": "Stock market next week: Indian indices, the Sensex and Nifty 50, extended gains for a second straight session on Friday, December 12, led by positive global sentiment following the US Federal Reserve's rate cut. The Sensex climbed 450 points, or 0.53%, to close at 85,267.66, while the Nifty 50 advanced 148 points, or 0.57%, to settle at 26,046.95. Broader markets outperformed, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rising 1.14% and 0.65%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies increased to over \u20b9470 lakh crore from \u20b9466.6 lakh crore in the previous session, adding more than \u20b93 lakh crore to investor wealth in a single trading session.\n\u201cMarkets remained volatile and ended the week in negative territory amid mixed domestic and global cues. Sentiment stayed subdued through most of the week and weakened further as selling pressure intensified, though a late rebound in the final sessions helped limit the downside. Persistent foreign fund outflows and a sharp depreciation in the rupee weighed heavily on investor confidence. As a result, the Nifty slipped 139 points to close at 26,046, while the Sensex declined 445 points to end at 85,268,\u201d said Ajit Mishra- SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.\nOn the market outlook, Mishra recommended investors to stay selective and maintain a balanced approach amid ongoing currency volatility and mixed global cues.\n\u201cLarge-cap exposure remains preferable, particularly in sectors such as private banking, automobiles, metals, and pharmaceuticals. Export-oriented stocks may continue to benefit from a weaker rupee, though IT could remain range-bound given correction in the US IT-heavy index, Nasdaq Composite. Caution is advised in mid and small caps as valuations remain elevated and liquidity support has moderated. Besides, traders should avoid chasing stocks facing negative news flow in anticipation of a rebound and wait for clear signs of stability before taking fresh exposure,\u201d Mishra added.\nMinistry of Commerce and Industry will be announcing WPI for the month of November, 2025 on December 15. Wholesale price inflation (WPI) eased to \u20131.21% in October, mainly due to falling prices of food items such as pulses and vegetables, along with declines in fuel and manufactured goods prices.\nAccording to PTI report, India and the United States have agreed to maintain their constructive and forward-looking engagement following two days of discussions between an Indian delegation and a US team led by Deputy US Trade Representative Rick Switzer, PTI reported.\nThe two sides concluded the talks on Thursday, during which they exchanged perspectives on key trade matters, including ongoing negotiations aimed at finalising a mutually advantageous bilateral trade agreement.\nThe rupee weakened by 17 paise to end Friday at a record low of 90.49 against the US dollar, as lingering uncertainty around the India\u2013US trade agreement and continued foreign investor outflows weighed on market sentiment.\nForex market participants noted that the currency remains under pressure due to strong dollar demand from importers, driven by a sharp rise in global precious metal prices.\nIn the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 90.43 per dollar before sliding to an all-time intraday low of 90.56, marking a 24-paise drop from the previous close. It eventually settled at 90.49, down 17 paise for the session.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) have persistently sold Indian equities throughout 2025 and are on track to post the second-highest number of net selling days in any calendar year over the past 20 years.\nSo far this year, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers on 141 of the 234 trading sessions, a figure that is likely to surpass the 146 sell days recorded in 2022 and trails only 2008, when net selling peaked at 154 days during the global financial crisis.\nGold prices climbed 1% on Friday to touch a seven-week high, supported by a weaker dollar, growing expectation"

                "body": "Escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela could lead to profound changes in the oil industry of the world\u2019s largest crude resource holder.\nAny regime change of President Nicolas Maduro could be a game-changer for oil production in Venezuela, U.S. access to Venezuela\u2019s heavy crude fit for U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, and America\u2019s influence in the Western Hemisphere and Latin America.\nAlthough it\u2019s not certain that U.S. President Donald Trump would necessarily pursue regime change or an incursion of some kind in Venezuela, it\u2019s certain that potentially eased sanctions and the free flow of Venezuelan crude could help with President Trump\u2019s fixation on keeping U.S. gasoline prices low.\nIt\u2019s also quite likely that Venezuela will remain part of OPEC, despite the decades-long ingrained antagonism between the United States and the cartel, Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso argues.\nVenezuela was actually one of the five founding members of OPEC back in 1960, alongside the major Persian Gulf producers Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Kuwait.\nPresident Trump has sought close ties with OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, in both his terms in office. Just last month, he hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a state visit to solidify the economic and defense partnership.\nIn 2020, President Trump persuaded OPEC and the OPEC+ coalition to slash oil supply during the pandemic when demand was cratering.\nIn other words, under President Trump, the U.S.-OPEC relationship is not what it used to be.\nA new U.S.-friendly government in Venezuela would be another ally within the cartel. OPEC produces about 40% of daily global oil supplies and manages output to keep prices stable. This cartel is a rival of U.S. oil producers, and its supply management policies have hurt many shale producers and put hundreds of others out of business over the past decade when prices have tanked.\nRelated: US Drillers Add Oil Rigs As Analysts Warn of Incoming Glut\nOPEC, for its part, would also be eager to keep Venezuela in the fold, following several internal spats over production levels and quotas since the OPEC+ group was created nearly a decade ago.\n\u201cPresident Trump prioritizes good relations with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. For those two co-founders of OPEC, keeping Venezuela in OPEC is more important than it is for Trump,\u201d Bob McNally, president at consultancy Rapidan Energy, told Reuters\u2019 Bousso.\nVenezuela is exempted from the OPEC+ production cuts and quotas due to the heavy sanctions on its oil industry and exports. The only Western firm currently operating in Venezuela is U.S. supermajor Chevron, via a special waiver to produce and export crude.\nEscalating tensions could lead to a short-term squeeze in Venezuela\u2019s supply, but a regime change away from Maduro could lead to easing of the U.S. sanctions, renewed foreign participation, and an increase in Venezuela\u2019s crude oil production.\nThis week, the tensions reached a boiling point as the U.S. seized a large oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, just as the U.S. released its latest national security strategy, which, among other things, emphasizes a strong U.S. influence in Latin America. The Trump Administration also heaped fresh sanctions to stifle Maduro\u2019s oil revenues by designating Maduro family members, a longtime business ally, and six companies operating tankers.\n\u201cIt is not clear that the US will push for regime change in Venezuela, or how such an attempt might play out if it did,\u201d energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said last week.\nIf sanctions were lifted and the desperately needed operational and financial support became available for Venezuela, it could have a significant impact on the country\u2019s production, in both the short and long term, WoodMac\u2019s analysts say.\nImproved operational management could result in quick increases in production, according to Adrian Lara, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s principal analyst for Latin America upstream.\n\u201cOur assumption is that there are a lot of wells that j"

                "body": "The Euro showed strength this week helped along by the comment from Isabel Schnabel indicating that the next rate move from the ECB might be a hike rather than a cut. EUR/USD tests a massive spot of resistance as EUR/JPY trades at fresh all-time-highs.\nThe Euro continued to show strength last week and notably, that strength even showed against the British Pound. I had been following the latter as a more-attractive venue for USD-weakness scenarios but given price action in the final two days of the week, that may be shifting.\nWhile EUR/USD was cautiously trading around prior November highs, GBP/USD had already built attractive bullish structure and this highlights the deviation between the pairs. But \u2013 as looked at in a Monday article on the British Pound, EUR/GBP was holding near a massive spot of support, and that hold ended up hanging on for a couple more days until a rally took over in the final days of the week.\nIn the major of EUR/USD, the pair has continued to test a big spot of Fibonacci resistance, spanning from 1.1686-1.1748. This zone came into play around the Q3 open and for the past five months has thwarted bulls from continuation pushes. The 1.1748 level held the highs on both Thursday and Friday and that remains the line-in-the-sand that bulls will need to deal with if they do want to exhibit control in early trade next week.\nEUR/USD Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Daily\nEUR/USD now has higher-high and higher-low structure on the daily chart and this keeps the door open for buyers to make a push. Notably, the CPI and NFP reports next week will probably bring a large push on USD flows and this can be considered as a major driver for EUR/USD. For support from the daily chart, it\u2019s the 1.1686 Fibonacci level and the 1.1613 prior swing low that stand out as important.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY Fresh ATH\nI looked at this setup on Monday and at the time, 182.00 had held as a significant high and 181.50 was showing as shorter-term range resistance. I went over a couple different ways to approach the breakout, and that setup hit cleanly later in the week with prices eventually driving up to another fresh all-time-high.\nThe 182.00 level ended up holding a few different tests of support \u2013 with 182.50 then becoming resistance, followed by a rally up to 183.00. So far, the psychological levels have held inflections well, and this sets up for 182.50 to show as support for bullish continuation approaches into next week, with the Bank of Japan rate decision later in the week likely playing a large role.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/GBP\nThe past month produced a notable pullback in EUR/GBP, just after the pair hit a fresh three-year-high. That pullback started to find support around prior resistance in the prior week, and then last week was largely continued recovery as buyers took a greater hold of the move on Thursday and Friday.\nThis keeps the door open for bullish continuation in the pair, and as looked at above, this can also speak to Euro strength in pairs like EUR/USD and EUR/JPY against GBP/USD and GBP/JPY.\nFor pullbacks in EUR/GBP, it\u2019s the .8738-.8753 area that buyers need to retain to keep control of near-term trends in the pair.\nEUR/GBP Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro"

Price is compressing into the upper part of the recent range, not fading from it. That tells you positioning is cautious but still biased to the upside: traders are waiting for the delayed US data and the next macro impulse rather than treating this zone as a final top.\nUSD Side: One More Cut, But A Split Fed Keeps The Dollar On The Defensive\nThe Fed cut the target range by 25 bp to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the real driver for the dollar is the internal division and \u201cpause\u201d tone. Several policymakers framed this as a period of assessment because key data have been delayed. Some officials stressed that inflation is still too high relative to the 2% target and were uncomfortable with moving faster. Others effectively argued that cutting earlier than 2026 risks losing control of the disinflation narrative. That split keeps the dollar from regaining clear bullish momentum: markets know more easing is plausible, but they also know the Fed will hide behind data for now, so the currency trades level-to-level instead of in a clean trend.\nMacro Data Backdrop: Jobs And Inflation Justify The Pause But Not A Hawkish Pivot\nThe latest figures before the data blackout still matter. Nonfarm payrolls previously showed around 199,000 new jobs with unemployment near 3.7%, signaling a labor market that is cooling at the margin but not collapsing. Headline CPI around 3.1% confirms disinflation compared with the peak, yet inflation remains above the 2% target. That combination justifies a pause after the cut but does not support an aggressive tightening reset. For EUR/USD this means the macro environment still leans toward a softer dollar over time, but the Fed can use these numbers as cover to resist market pressure for a rapid rate-cut path if incoming data surprises hotter.\nEuro Inflation And ECB Stance: Not Strong Enough To Kill The EUR Bid\nOn the European side, inflation data are mixed rather than outright deflationary. Germany\u2019s HICP fell 0.5% month on month in November but held at 2.6% year on year. Spain\u2019s HICP moved up to 3.2% year on year from 3.1%. At the euro area level, the latest reference you supplied for November shows inflation around 2.4%. This profile gives the ECB very little reason to rush into deep cuts while the Fed has already started trimming. The result is straightforward for EUR/USD: the euro does not need to be aggressively strong; it only needs to avoid becoming the \u201cpolicy laggard\u201d against a dollar whose own central bank is already easing. That relative stance supports the pair staying elevated above 1.17 rather than rolling over.\nDXY Structure: Broken Support At 98.98 Turns Into A Ceiling\nDollar index price action confirms the shift in balance. A key 2025 pivot around 98.98 that previously acted as support has been broken and now behaves as resistance on rebounds. A nearby shelf around 98.60 caught a short-term bounce but failed to reverse the broader slide. Below current levels, there is an unfilled gap in the 97.71\u201397.96 area and a projected downside target near 97.46 from a larger topping structure. If bears push the index down into that zone, EUR/USD will have room to extend higher without needing additional positive euro-specific catalysts. The message from the dollar side is simple: unless EUR/USD fails technically, broader USD tone still favors rallies in the pair rather than deep, durable pullbacks.\nCore EUR/USD Level"

The British pound remains bid against the US dollar, despite softer UK economic data, mainly due to renewed expectations of rate cuts by the Fed in 2026.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms?

The GBP/USD marked multi-week highs near 1.3430 before correcting lower to 1.3360 by the end of the week. However, the pair stays underpinned amid the Fed-BoE rate differential.\nThe Fed rate cut and dovish signals to cut rates further into 2026 gave the pound a decisive push above key levels. Meanwhile, Thursday\u2019s US Jobless Claims figures reflected an increase of 44k claims, adding more weight to the \u201clabor market cooling\u201d narrative. However, the UK GDP data on Friday surprisingly showed a contraction of 0.1%. The weak print intensified the odds of a BoE rate cut in the December meeting. However, the pound briefly dipped without sabotaging the uptrend.\nMoving ahead to the next week, the GBP/USD will remain sensitive to the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision, the MPC vote split, and its accompanying statement. The markets are pricing in a 90% probability of a 25 bps rate cut.\nFrom the US, NFP and US inflation will be key events to watch, as strong US jobs or elevated inflation figures could boost the US dollar, weighing on the GBP/USD. Meanwhile, softer data could offset the BoE\u2019s rate cut pressure on the pound.\nMajor Releases to Watch Next Week:\n- UK PMIs\n- BoE Interest Rate Decision & Monetary Policy Summary\n- UK Average Earnings / Unemployment data\n- US Nonfarm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate\n- US Retail Sales and PMI data\nGBP/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Bullish Above 1.3350\nThe GBP/USD daily chart shows a strong uptrend, supported by the confluence of 100- and 200-day MAs around 1.3350. Meanwhile, the RSI remains near the 60.0 level, suggesting further room for an upside. However, a doji candle presents a mild selling pressure, attributed to profit-taking, which could resist further upside beyond the weekly highs of 1.3438.

                "body": "Setup for Significant Volatility\nThe pound is holding firm against the dollar, but we are facing a critical week with jobs data, inflation numbers, and a Bank of England (BoE) meeting on the horizon. This cluster of high-impact events creates a setup for significant volatility in the GBP/USD pair. Traders should be preparing for sharp movements rather than a continuation of the recent calm.\nFocus should be squarely on Thursday\u2019s BoE interest rate decision. A 25-basis-point cut is already fully priced into the market, meaning the cut itself will not be the primary driver of price action. The key will be the bank\u2019s forward guidance and any change in tone regarding the path of future rate cuts.\nThe market currently expects a series of further cuts in 2026, which makes the pound vulnerable to any neutral or slightly hawkish messaging from the BoE. We see a real risk that the Bank will signal a \u201cone and done\u201d approach for now, or at least push back against expectations for aggressive easing. Such a development would likely cause the pound to rally sharply, as it would be a direct surprise to the current market consensus.\nAdding to this view, we\u2019ve seen UK wage growth remain stubbornly high, with the latest data for November showing a 4.1% annual increase, which is still too hot for the BoE. Furthermore, the consensus forecast for next week\u2019s CPI reading is 2.8%, which remains well above the bank\u2019s 2% target. These data points give the BoE cover to deliver a hawkish cut, trimming rates now but warning that the fight against inflation isn\u2019t over.\nPositioning Strategies\nThis scenario has historical precedent, reminding us of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s actions throughout 2024. During that period, the market repeatedly priced in rate cuts that the Fed ultimately delayed due to persistent data. We could see a similar dynamic play out with the BoE, where official guidance diverges from market hopes.\nFor derivatives traders, this suggests positioning for a potential upward move in GBP/USD. Buying out-of-the-money call options for late December or January could offer a low-premium way to profit from a hawkish surprise from the BoE. This strategy defines your risk to the amount paid for the option while offering significant upside potential.\nAlternatively, for those who anticipate a major move but are unsure of the direction, a long straddle strategy could be appropriate. This involves buying both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. It will pay off if the pound makes a significant move in either direction following the BoE announcement, capitalizing on the spike in volatility itself."

                "body": "GBP/USD Weekly Outlook: Fed Cut, BoE Risk And The 1.3400 Line\nFed Cut Drives GBP/USD Above 1.3400 Before Late-Week Pullback\nGBP/USD traded this week in a clearly positive band, pushing up to multi-week highs in the 1.3430\u20131.3438 region before slipping back toward roughly 1.3360 into the close. The advance was driven by the latest 25 bps Fed rate cut and guidance pointing to further easing in 2026, which hit the USD and allowed the pound to break decisively through the 1.3400 handle. Even after a 70\u201380 pip retracement from the top, the pair is still holding most of the upside built over the last three weeks.\nRate Differentials: Why GBP Still Has An Edge Over USD\nThe current structure in GBP/USD is anchored in expectations that the Fed will have to ease more aggressively than the BoE through 2026. After this week\u2019s cut, markets are positioned for additional Fed reductions, while the BoE is only now approaching its first move lower. That relative path has favored the pound and helped force the break above 1.3400. At the same time, worsening UK growth means the UK side of the spread is deteriorating, which is exactly why price stalled near 1.3430\u20131.3438 instead of trending cleanly toward higher levels.\nUK Macro Backdrop: Two Straight -0.1% GDP Prints Pressure GBP\nOctober UK GDP came in at -0.1% month-on-month versus expectations of +0.1%, after a prior -0.1% contraction. Two consecutive negative prints confirm a stalling domestic economy. The weak data has pushed market-implied odds of a December BoE rate cut up to around 90% for a 25 bps move. A central bank easing into negative growth normally weighs on GBP, which is why the pound dipped immediately after the release, even though the broader uptrend in GBP/USD remained intact thanks to dollar weakness.\nUS Labor And Fed: Jobless Claims Jump 44K And Undercut The Dollar\nOn the U.S. side, Jobless Claims rose by roughly 44,000 in the latest weekly print, reinforcing the \u201ccooling labor market\u201d narrative. Combined with the third straight 25 bps Fed cut, that soft data strengthened expectations for a more aggressive easing path in 2026. The result was renewed dollar selling and a decisive push in GBP/USD to about 1.3417 at one point, putting the pair above 1.3400 and at its highest level in roughly six weeks before profit-taking set in.\nEvent Risk Cluster: BoE Meeting, UK Data, US NFP And CPI\nThe next move in GBP/USD will be dictated by a dense data and policy calendar. For the UK, PMI releases, Average Earnings, and unemployment figures will shape how far the BoE feels it can go on cuts beyond December. Softer PMIs and weaker wage growth would reinforce recession worries and add downside pressure to the pound. For the US, Nonfarm Payrolls, the unemployment rate, CPI, Retail Sales, and PMIs will drive the USD leg. Strong NFP or sticky inflation would support a broader dollar rebound; weaker numbers would revive selling pressure on the greenback and partially offset the impact of a BoE cut on GBP.\nTrend Structure: GBP/USD Still In A Clear Uptrend Above 1.3350\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD remains in a defined uptrend. Price is supported by the confluence of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages sitting around 1.3350. The latest candle near the highs is a doji, signaling hesitation and profit-taking as the market tested the 1.3430\u20131.3438 band. That pattern warns of near-term consolidation or a corrective pullback, but as long as closes remain above 1.3350, the underlying bullish structure is intact rather than reversed.\nMomentum Profile: RSI Near 60 Keeps The Bullish Door Open\nDaily RSI hovering near 60 shows that GBP/USD is trending higher without being stretched. The market is not yet overbought, which means the pair still has room to push higher if upcoming macro releases do not flip the narrative. Rising price, firm support at the key moving averages, and mid-range momentum together describe a \u201cbuy dips while the trend holds\u201d setup rather than an exhaustion top.\nOverhead Hurdles: 1.34"

Despite the late-week surge, gold pulled back more than 1.2% off the highs and the immediate focus is on inflection off this threshold in the weeks ahead with the recent advance vulnerable while below.\nInitial weekly support now rests with the 38.2% retracement of the late-October advance at 4175 and is backed by the record high-week reversal close at 4112- losses below this threshold would threaten a more significant correction. Subsequent support rests at 4000 with broader bullish invalidation at the October low at 3886. Note that the lower parallel of the yearly pitchfork converges on this threshold over the next few weeks and break below would suggest a larger trend reversal is underway.\nA topside breach / close above 4356 would be needed to mark resumption of the yearly uptrend with subsequent resistance objectives eyed 75% parallel (currently near ~4430s) and the 1.618% extension of the 2024 December rally at 4603.

EUR/USD tests a massive spot of resistance as EUR/JPY trades at fresh all-time-highs.\nThe Euro continued to show strength last week and notably, that strength even showed against the British Pound. I had been following the latter as a more-attractive venue for USD-weakness scenarios but given price action in the final two days of the week, that may be shifting.\nWhile EUR/USD was cautiously trading around prior November highs, GBP/USD had already built attractive bullish structure and this highlights the deviation between the pairs. But \u2013 as looked at in a Monday article on the British Pound, EUR/GBP was holding near a massive spot of support, and that hold ended up hanging on for a couple more days until a rally took over in the final days of the week.\nIn the major of EUR/USD, the pair has continued to test a big spot of Fibonacci resistance, spanning from 1.1686-1.1748. This zone came into play around the Q3 open and for the past five months has thwarted bulls from continuation pushes. The 1.1748 level held the highs on both Thursday and Friday and that remains the line-in-the-sand that bulls will need to deal with if they do want to exhibit control in early trade next week.\nEUR/USD Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Daily\nEUR/USD now has higher-high and higher-low structure on the daily chart and this keeps the door open for buyers to make a push. Notably, the CPI and NFP reports next week will probably bring a large push on USD flows and this can be considered as a major driver for EUR/USD. For support from the daily chart, it\u2019s the 1.1686 Fibonacci level and the 1.1613 prior swing low that stand out as important.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY Fresh ATH\nI looked at this setup on Monday and at the time, 182.00 had held as a significant high and 181.50 was showing as shorter-term range resistance. I went over a couple different ways to approach the breakout, and that setup hit cleanly later in the week with prices eventually driving up to another fresh all-time-high.\nThe 182.00 level ended up holding a few different tests of support \u2013 with 182.50 then becoming resistance, followed by a rally up to 183.00. So far, the psychological levels have held inflections well, and this sets up for 182.50 to show as support for bullish continuation approaches into next week, with the Bank of Japan rate decision later in the week likely playing a large role.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/GBP\nThe past month produced a notable pullback in EUR/GBP, just after the pair hit a fresh three-year-high. That pullback started to find support around prior resistance in the prior week, and then last week was largely continued recovery as buyers took a greater hold of the move on Thursday and Friday.\nThis keeps the door open for bullish continuation in the pair, and as looked at above, this can also speak to Euro strength in pairs like EUR/USD and EUR/JPY against GBP/USD and GBP/JPY.\nFor pullbacks in EUR/GBP, it\u2019s the .8738-.8753 area that buyers need to retain to keep control of near-term trends in the pair.\nEUR/GBP Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro\nFrom time to time, StoneX Financial Pty Ltd (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d) website may contain links to other sites and/or resources provided by third parties.

                "body": "USD/JPY rebounded on a hawkish Fed, yet a packed Japanese data calendar and a looming BoJ rate decision leave the pair exposed to heightened volatility. The pair snapped a two-week losing streak in the week ending Friday, December 12, gaining 0.30% to close at 155.799.\nThe Fed\u2019s dot plot and expectations of sticky inflation and a resilient labor market overshadowed strong Japanese wage growth and bets on a December BoJ rate hike.\nDespite the USD/JPY pullback, the BoJ rate hike, and the prospect of further hikes in 2026, support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, several Japanese economic indicators will influence sentiment toward the BoJ rate path. Key economic reports include Q4 Tankan survey, Services PMI, trade, and inflation data, ahead of the all-important BoJ monetary policy decision.\nThe Japanese economic reports and the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy decision set the stage for a volatile week for USD/JPY. Notably, forecasts support a short- to medium-term bearish outlook for the pair.\nOn Monday, December 15, the BoJ\u2019s Tankan surveys will come under scrutiny. The Tankan Large Manufacturers Index is likely to be the key focal point, given the BoJ\u2019s ongoing assessment of the effects of US tariffs on the Japanese economy.\nEconomists expect the Tankan Large Manufacturers Index to increase from 14 in Q3 to 15 in Q4. A higher reading would reflect an upswing in sentiment across larger manufacturers.\nImproving sentiment would also signal increased business investment and higher wages, a focal point for the BoJ. Rising wages may boost household spending, fueling demand-driven inflation and lifting economic momentum. Private consumption accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nBoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently hinted at an imminent rate hike, citing wage growth and subsiding US tariff risks. A higher Tankan Large Manufacturers Index reading would align with Governor Ueda\u2019s views, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance and a stronger yen.\nOn Tuesday, December 16, preliminary private sector PMI data will be in focus. The S&P Global Services PMI will be the focal point, given that services account for around 70% of the GDP. Economists forecast the S&P Global Services PMI to drop from 53.2 in November to 51.6 in December.\nWhile slower services sector activity may signal a loss of economic momentum, holding above the 50 neutral level will be key. Furthermore, traders should focus on the employment and prices sub-components. A tighter labor market, higher wage growth (input prices), and hotter inflation (output prices) would signal a more hawkish BoJ rate path.\nOn Wednesday, December 17, Japanese trade data will provide insights into the effect of US tariffs on demand. Economists predict exports to rise 4.8% year-on-year (YoY) in November, up from 3.6% in October. Imports are expected to rise 2.5% YoY in November, up from 0.7% in October.\nA sharp pickup in external demand and robust imports would support Governor Ueda\u2019s view that US tariff risks have diminished. Given Japan\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio is roughly 45%, improving trade terms would boost the economy and demand for the yen.\nFor context, external demand fell 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, contributing to a 0.6% economic contraction. However, the US reduced tariffs on Japanese goods from 25% to 15% in Q3, boosting external demand early in Q4.\nOn Friday, December 19, national inflation figures will draw interest ahead of the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy decision. Economists forecast the so-called core-core annual inflation rate to remain at 3.1% in November. Steady or rising core-core inflation would boost expectations of a more hawkish BoJ monetary policy outlook.\nThese forecasts align with the BoJ rate hike bets and a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY. However, the BoJ monetary policy decision and Governor "

                "body": "The Japanese Yen is weakening against the US Dollar, underperforming most G10 currencies. As markets anticipate the BoJ\u2019s meeting, a 25 basis points rate hike is expected. Officials indicate possible further tightening by 2026, setting USD/JPY between 154 to 157.\nIn the North American session, the Yen saw a 0.2% decline against the US Dollar, except against the SEK and NOK. Indications of a hawkish shift at the Bank of Japan have yet to bolster the Yen, with reports suggesting an extension of the tightening cycle beyond 0.75%.\nJapanese Yen and Rate Hike Expectations\nNext week\u2019s Bank of Japan policy decision is anticipated to raise the rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. Policymakers seem to be preparing for more tightening by 2026. The USD/JPY remains neutral, waiting to break the current range between 154 and 157.\nVarious other market updates include discussions on global currency activities, commodity trends, and market forecasts. The content also focuses on the performance of various Forex and commodity indices, along with forward-looking statements on future market positions. The information does not constitute financial advice and should be independently verified.\nThe Japanese Yen is showing some weakness against the dollar even though everyone expects the Bank of Japan to hike rates next week. This has kept the USD/JPY pair stuck in a tight channel, roughly between 154 and 157. The market seems to believe this 0.25% rate hike is already factored into the current price.\nWe think the market is looking past this single rate increase and focusing on the bigger picture. Recent data showed Japan\u2019s nationwide core CPI for November came in at 2.7%, slightly below consensus, which doesn\u2019t scream for aggressive future hikes. This is why hawkish talk from policymakers isn\u2019t strengthening the yen; the market needs to see more convincing economic data first.\nGiven this uncertainty ahead of the BoJ meeting, implied volatility on one-week USD/JPY options has ticked up to over 11.5%. This suggests traders are pricing in a sharp move, but are unsure of the direction. For derivatives traders, this means short-term options strategies could be useful to capitalize on the expected price swing after the announcement.\nMarket Dynamics and Derivatives Trading\nWe saw a similar pattern after the historic rate hike in March 2024; the yen actually weakened as the rate gap with the US remained vast. History suggests that even with a hike, the yen may struggle unless the BoJ signals a much faster pace of tightening for 2026. Until then, the high interest rate in the US makes holding dollars more attractive.\nThis is all happening while US inflation shows signs of cooling, with the latest November CPI figure at 3.1% year-over-year. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates steady into the new year, but the key is the difference in rates between the two countries. That large gap continues to support the dollar over the yen for now.\nThe main play for derivative traders is positioning for a breakout from the current 154-157 range. We could use strategies like straddles or strangles to profit from a significant move, regardless of whether it\u2019s up or down. A decisive break below 154 would signal yen strength, while a push above 157 would indicate the dollar\u2019s dominance continues."

Correlation with 2026 Fed cut pricing is around -0.7 and with the two year Treasury yield around +0.77, while links to the 10 year, broader U.S.\u2013Japan spreads or classic risk gauges like the S&P 500 and VIX are weaker. That tells you the pair is trading almost directly off expectations for near term Fed policy rather than long duration or equities. With the two year near 3.55%, the five year around 3.74%, the 10 year about 4.18% and the 30 year up near 4.83, the yield gap versus Japan still firmly favors the dollar and keeps carry flows supportive even after the Fed\u2019s latest cut.\nPayrolls Unemployment And US Labor Data As Volatility Catalyst\nThe next U.S. jobs report sits at the center of the USD/JPY risk map. Markets look for roughly a 40,000 payrolls gain and an unemployment rate holding at 4.4. Fed communication makes clear that the employment side of the mandate now dominates: soft labor data is the justification for further easing, not inflation alone. A materially weaker payrolls print or a surprise move higher in unemployment would drag front end yields down, trigger another dovish repricing of cuts and push USD/JPY quickly lower out of the recent range. A strong upside surprise in jobs flips the script, reinforces the idea that the economy can tolerate fewer cuts and supports a renewed push toward and potentially beyond recent highs.\nFed Speakers Hawkish Dissent And Confusion Around The Path Of Cuts\nRecent Fed commentary has added noise and widened the distribution of outcomes for USD/JPY. Cleveland Fed President Schmid openly argued that inflation is still \u201ctoo hot,\u201d and warned that policy may be only modestly restrictive at best. That is essentially a challenge to the market\u2019s aggressive easing path and a reminder that parts of the FOMC would have preferred no cut at the last meeting. Chicago Fed President Goolsbee dissented for different reasons: he objected to cutting before inflation clearly breaks lower and stressed that the \u201clow hiring, low firing\u201d labor pattern does not scream recession. Together, their messages tell FX traders that the Fed is split on the speed of cuts, which keeps the front end \u2013 and therefore USD/JPY \u2013 highly sensitive to each data release and every speech from core figures like Williams and Waller.\nSupreme Court Proceedings And Perceived Risk To Fed Autonomy\nBeyond macro data, legal risk is now part of the story. The Supreme Court hearing on efforts to remove an FTC commissioner is seen as an early test case for challenges to the independence of U.S. regulatory agencies. Markets are already thinking ahead to similar arguments around attempts to fire a Fed governor next year. Any signal that the Court is willing to weaken protections for independent agencies would raise questions about Fed autonomy and could weigh on longer dated Treasuries and the dollar. For USD/JPY, that injects a second layer of uncertainty: not just \u201chow many cuts and when,\u201d but \u201chow insulated is the Fed from political pressure if the growth or inflation narrative shifts.\u201d\nBank Of Japan Meeting Hike Probability And Rate Path\nOn the Japanese side, the near term focus is entirely on the upcoming Bank of Japan decision. Consensus is for a 25 basis point move to 0.75, and market pricing sits in the 80 to 90 percent probability range after weeks without any pushback from BoJ or government officials. That means a standard 0.25 hike is largely embedded in USD/JPY around the 155\u2013156 zone. What matte"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar continues to perform well, benefiting from supportive rate differentials and a weakening US Dollar. Though short-term indicators suggest a possible pause or rebound, technical analysis indicates further decline toward the 1.35\u20131.36 range.\nThe CAD is showing gains, currently trading at its highest level since September against the USD, marking its best streak since April. Supportive spreads for the CAD suggest that relative monetary policy could continue to act as a positive driver.\nPossible Downward Movement for USD\nIf the USD closes below the 1.3769 level, it may push the focus further downward, possibly reaching 1.35/1.36 soon. While treasury momentum oscillators suggest a bearish stance for the USD, temporary reversals may occur before any major downtrend.\nBearish trend momentum oscillators indicate that USD losses may be limited and provide opportunities for USD sellers to take advantage. Resistance levels are seen at 1.3850/75 and 1.3900/40.\nThe article includes insights from experts and additional analysis, focusing on trends and technical indicators affecting the currency market.\nWe are seeing the Canadian dollar continue its strong performance, trading at its highest level since September. This is largely driven by the outlook for interest rates, as the Bank of Canada held its rate steady at 4.25% last week, while the Federal Reserve is signaling potential cuts for early next year. This policy difference is making the Canadian dollar more attractive.\nCatalyst from Commodity Prices\nFor derivative traders, this suggests positioning for a further drop in the USD/CAD exchange rate toward the 1.35 to 1.36 range. One could consider buying options that profit if the US dollar falls below these levels in the coming weeks. This view is supported by recent data showing Canada\u2019s job market added a solid 40,000 positions in November, while Canadian inflation remains stickier at 3.2% compared to the cooling 2.9% rate in the US.\nHowever, we should be mindful that the US dollar\u2019s decline has been swift, which could lead to a small, temporary rebound. A brief rally back towards the 1.3850 resistance area would not be surprising. Traders can see any such temporary bounce as an opportunity to enter new bearish positions at a better price.\nThe strength in the Canadian dollar is also getting a boost from commodity prices, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil holding firm around $85 a barrel. This environment is reminiscent of what we saw back in late 2022, when a similar divergence between central bank policies led to a sustained period of Canadian dollar strength. That historical pattern provides a useful guide for the potential path forward."

                "body": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) enters the final stretch of the decade with its biggest question yet: can BTC climb to the $500K\u2013$1M range as adoption deepens and supply tightens? The past six months show how quickly momentum can shift, but the long-term picture depends on forces far bigger than short-term price swings.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs, sovereign interest, institutional demand, and the 2028 halving are all converging at once. Bitcoin\u2019s path to 2030 rides on how these drivers interact over the next five years.\nBitcoin Price Performance in Six Months\nBitcoin\u2019s last six months show a rapid climb, a peak, and a steady cooldown. BTC started the period near $107,135 in June, pushed to a record $126,000 in early October, then slipped and now trades around $90,000. That\u2019s a 16.7% slide from June and a deeper 26.3% correction from the October peak.\nThe pattern tells the story. Early strength gave way to a sharp reversal, followed by months of selling pressure through late fall. December has steadied, with BTC holding the $86K\u2013$92K range. This looks more like consolidation than collapse, giving the market a clearer base before its next major move.\nWhat Will Drive Bitcoin\u2019s 2030 Value\nBitcoin\u2019s long-term outlook rests on catalysts that are now deeply embedded in global finance. The next major move will come from structural demand, shrinking supply, and how fully tBitcoin integrates into institutional systems. These drivers will shape whether Bitcoin leans toward $500K or pushes toward $1M by decade\u2019s end.\nInstitutional ETF Demand\nSpot ETFs have rewritten Bitcoin\u2019s demand profile. Capital from pensions, advisors, and sovereign reserves now enters through regulated channels and stays in rotation. US spot Bitcoin ETF assets peaked at $169 billion in October 2025 before settling at $120 billion by December, while total crypto ETF assets globally approach $180 billion.\nBy 2030, global ETF demand could exceed $500\u2013$800 billion. This steady allocation cycle absorbs supply regardless of short-term sentiment, creating upward pressure that earlier cycles never had.\nHalving Cycles and Supply Compression\nThe 2028 halving will cut daily issuance to roughly 225 BTC during a period when long-term holders control most supply. New Bitcoin entering the market becomes scarce just as ETF allocations expand.\nHistory shows that price acceleration peaks 12\u201324 months after a halving. With supply thinning and liquidity locked in stronger hands, the 2029\u20132030 window becomes the breakout phase. Demand could overwhelm what little supply remains.\nBitcoin as a Macro Hedge\nBitcoin has become a tool for navigating unstable monetary conditions. The sharp rallies during inflation drops and geopolitical stress show that institutions now treat it as a modern counterpart to gold.\nGlobal debt keeps climbing and major economies face currency pressure. Bitcoin gains appeal as a neutral reserve asset. By 2030, if wealth managers hold even small percentage allocations for hedging, the inflows could reshape Bitcoin\u2019s entire price structure.\nCorporate Treasury and Banking Adoption\nCompanies and banks are moving beyond speculative interest. Bitcoin is getting integrated into working financial systems as hundreds of publicly traded companies now hold BTC, following MicroStrategy\u2019s model of long-term accumulation. Banks now use Bitcoin as collateral in lending markets, giving the asset utility without requiring liquidation.\nAs Bitcoin becomes standard collateral across global credit markets, institutional demand grows while selling pressure fades. That sustained holding behavior supports higher valuations over time.\nInfrastructure and Global Liquidity Growth\nBitcoin\u2019s ecosystem now includes institutional custody, derivatives markets, and global settlement rails that match traditional finance in maturity. Regulatory clarity across major regions has opened the door for seamless cross-border adoption.\nBy 2030, Bitcoin is likely to trade with deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and full integrati"

However, the initial swing low was reached in 2023 at around the $16,000 area.\nSince then, a bull market began that reached 2021\u2019s high around $70,000 by early 2024, with a decent pullback rally that continued flipping this high and reached $108,000 in early 2025, and Q3 of 2025 marked an ATH of $126,296.\nThis advancement marked a huge 675% surge in 1008 days when it reached ATH, but this price action of multi-year was happening inside a broadening ascending wedge. And Q4 2025 is seeing a decline from the upper border of this reliable old pattern.\nEven the two-year parallel ascending channel has also confirmed a breakdown from the lower border, suggesting a significant decline is forthcoming.\nSince the price action doesn\u2019t fall straight, the year is also about to conclude next month. So, bulls are trying to show a little fight, even FOMC news didn\u2019t generate any momentum. It appears that bears are still influencing BTC\u2019s price action. The current zone of $90K is key; losing it here will let BTC slide back to $80K, and if this fails too. Then the $70K to $75K range would be retested next, where a demand could arise that might trigger a rebound, and the rally could extend to new highs as well.\nHowever, if bulls fail to present a proper fight around the $70,000 to $75,000 support area, then the BTC will fall further, as it could trigger a price action that traps long buyers, potentially leading to a decline towards $53,489 in the first half of next year.\nBitcoin Price Prediction December 2025\nThe Bitcoin price forecast December 2025 suggests that this month will play a pivotal role in determining the future direction of BTC. As we in the final days of fourth quarter, Bitcoin has experienced a decline, dropping below the $100K"

Considering all these aspects, the investors are likely seeking more insights on the potential future momentum of the market before putting their bets into the asset.\nOn the other hand, the declining fund flow into the US Spot Bitcoin ETF also suggests that the institutions are treading cautiously.\nAmid this, the market experts have shared key Bitcoin USD price levels to watch ahead, which might set the future movement of BTC price.\nBitcoin ETF Sees Inflow as BlackRock Turns Bullish\nThe US Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded an inflow of $49.1 million on December 12, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT providing the biggest boost with $51.1 million influx.\nAccording to Farside Investors\u2019 data, all the other issuers have recorded no change, with only Fidelity\u2019s FBTC recording an outflow of $2 million.\nThe weekly inflow into the investment instrument through Friday, December 12, totaled $286.6 million.\nNotably, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF was the highest contributor, providing an inflow of $214.1 million alone through the week.\nNotably, the US Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded an inflow for three days this week, with only two sessions in the red.\nOn December 8 and December 11, the investment instrument recorded an outflow of $60.4 million and $77.5 million, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the data suggests that the institutions have turned bullish on the asset this week, despite the gloomy momentum recorded in the broader market.\nFor context, the crypto market has mostly stayed in the red this week, after a recovery at the start, with BTC price reaching $94,000.\nThis indicates that the retail investors are still trading cautiously amid the topsy-turvy scenario recorded in the broader market.\nBesides, the experts have also shared key insights on the Bitcoin USD price levels to watch ahead, which has caught the eyes of traders.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Bitcoin USD Price?\nAmid the positive fund flow into the US Spot Bitcoin ETF, BTC USD price has failed to showcase any positive momentum.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin USD price was down over 2% and traded near $92,200, with its trading volume soaring 16% to $80 billion.\nNotably, the BTC price has touched a 24-hour high and low of $92,618 and $89,532, respectively. Amid this, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the key Bitcoin price levels to watch ahead.\nFor context, the expert said that Bitcoin USD faces major resistance at $99,000 and $122,000. In other words, if BTC price can break through the $99,000 mark, it could target the $122k level ahead.\nOn the other hand, the major support for the crypto lies at $76,000 and $53,000, based on the pricing bands.\nHaving said that, it seems that the crypto might witness a massive pullback if it fails to hold the $90,000 support level."

                "body": "Ethereum heats up over key ETF decision. Here's what you need to know.\nEthereum, the nerdy cryptocurrency that was lately overshadowed by Bitcoin, is in the news again, and the price is pumping. What gives?\nWell, only one of the most important developments in Ethereum's history, anon. An Ethereum spot ETF (Exchange Traded-Fund) might get approved in the U.S. today \u2014 that's Thursday, May 23.\nUPDATE: May. 24, 2024, 11:51 a.m. CEST The first Ethereum ETFs indeed got the nod from regulators on Thursday, though there's more steps and hoops to jump through (see part on the S-1 form below) before they can actually start trading.\nBefore we get into all that, here's a very short primer on Ethereum or ETH. Launched in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin and others, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin, and it has been so for the better part of the past five years or so.\nYou May Also Like\nWhat is this Ethereum thing you speak of?\nEthereum is a very different beast from Bitcoin. The latter is a digital currency and a public ledger of transactions that uses a network of computers (miners) to securely verify every transaction in the system, as well as create new coins through a computing-intensive process called proof-of-work.\nEthereum is a blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Unlike Bitcoin, it uses proof-of-stake to power and secure the network, meaning there is no environmentally unfriendly mining, with validators using a stake of their ether or ETH (the underlying currency of the platform) to validate transactions. Also, unlike Bitcoin, which is all about the secure sending and receiving of bitcoins and fairly little else, Ethereum is a platform for other decentralized apps (also called smart contracts) to run on.\nAs you can imagine, this makes Ethereum more powerful than Bitcoin in a sense, but it also makes it more complicated, both in terms of usage and implications. These days, basically everyone \u2014 the likes of large banks and pensions funds included \u2014 understands Bitcoin to be a largely decentralized digital asset, which can be bought, securely stored and sold, akin to a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a lot more complicated, with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not being entirely clear on whether ETH is a security or not.\nAn ETH ETF is now a very real possibility\nThis leads us to the part about ETFs. In January 2024, after receiving the SEC's blessing, Bitcoin spot ETF funds started trading in the United States. This had immense implications as to who can buy Bitcoin; suddenly, a U.S. state pension fund or an investment fund was able to easily get exposure to Bitcoin without worrying about breaking some rule. And the \"spot\" part, in contrast to a futures ETF, means that the Bitcoin spot ETFs must buy actual Bitcoins when someone buys their product.\nThe interest was record-breaking, with more than $13 billion flowing into BTC via spot ETFs since their inception. And unsurprisingly, the price of Bitcoin soared from around $42,000 in early January to roughly $69,500 at writing time.\nMany of the same entities \u2014 large investment companies such as BlackRock, VanEck, and Ark \u2014 also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, with deadlines for SEC's approval or denial starting on May 23. And up until a few days ago, analysts largely believed that the ETFs would be denied, given SEC's previous reluctance to provide clear guidance over whether ETH is a security or not.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nThis has changed. According to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas, there was \"chatter\" that the SEC has completely reversed its stance on Ethereum, followed by a slew of potential ETF issuers submitting amended 19b-4 forms to the SEC, signaling that there's a very good chance that the ETFs are on their way for approval.\nWe know, the sheer mention of something like a 19b-4 form made you fall asleep instantly. But we mention it because there"

After a year defined by sharp rallies, tariff-driven risk shocks, and sudden liquidations, the market is settling into a late\u2011December rhythm where macro headlines and regulation matter as much as on-chain fundamentals. [1]\nBut \u201cquiet\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cboring.\u201d In the last few days alone, the crypto story has expanded beyond price action into U.S. banking charter approvals for major crypto firms, new moves around tokenization and market infrastructure, and a filing that aims to bring Ethereum staking yield into an ETF wrapper\u2014all while investors brace for a data-heavy week ahead that could swing rates, the dollar, and risk appetite.\nMarket snapshot (as of Dec. 13, 2025): Bitcoin and Ethereum steady, but not \u201crisk-free\u201d\n- Bitcoin (BTC): ~$90,589\n- Ethereum (ETH): ~$3,133\n- XRP: ~$2.13\nContext matters: Reuters notes Bitcoin hit an all\u2011time peak above $126,000 in early October, but struggled to regain momentum after the post\u2011October risk shock\u2014highlighting how tightly crypto has traded with broader risk sentiment this year. [2]\nThat \u201cBitcoin as a macro asset\u201d framing is one of the most important takeaways for anyone tracking the week ahead.\nWhat happened in crypto this week: 6 headlines that actually moved the narrative\n1) The Fed cut rates \u2014 and the message was more complicated than the headline\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve delivered another 25 bp cut, taking the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the internal split and the forward path are what markets are really digesting. CoinShares highlighted that the decision was widely expected, yet the committee dynamics and projections suggested a slower future easing trajectory than some investors wanted. [3]\nIn parallel, Reuters reported pushback from senior Fed voices warning inflation is still too high\u2014Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said he dissented because policy should stay modestly restrictive, while Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer a tighter stance given inflation concerns. [4]\nWhy crypto cared: Reuters has documented that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with equities strengthened in 2025, and that rate expectations increasingly act as a key driver of crypto sentiment\u2014especially when markets are already nervous about valuation pockets elsewhere (notably tech/AI). [5]\n2) On-chain and derivatives signals: \u201canchored, but under strain\u201d\nGlassnode\u2019s Week On-Chain described Bitcoin as stuck in a fragile range, with rising unrealized losses, elevated realized losses, and profit-taking from long-term holders. It also pointed to thin spot liquidity, soft futures positioning, and options traders paying up for short-dated volatility and downside protection. [6]\nGlassnode framed the current zone with widely watched reference levels:\n- True Market Mean around ~$81.3K\n- 0.75 cost-basis quantile around ~$95K\n- Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis around ~$102.7K [7]\nTranslation: Bitcoin may be stable, but it\u2019s stable in a market that\u2019s sensitive\u2014where a macro surprise can matter more than a single bullish crypto headline.\n3) Crypto ETP/ETF flows improved\u2014yet spot ETF demand still looks selective\nCoinShares reported that digital asset ETPs saw $716M in weekly inflows (its Dec. 8 report), lifting total AuM to about $180B, with broad-based participation led by the U.S. [8]\nAt the same time, Glassnode characterized recent U.S. Bitcoin ETF flows as \u201cquiet,\u201d with net flows below zero on a short-term average, reinforcing the idea that institutions are engaged\u2014but cautious and price-sensitive. [9]\nAnd the broader backdrop remains choppy: Reuters previously reported a record $523M one-day outflow from BlackRock\u2019s flagship spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during the November selloff\u2014an example of how fast ETF \u201cbeta\u201d can flip when risk appetite turns.

Notably, recent developments around Ripple [XRP] are directly targeting this space.\nHex Trust, a digital asset solutions firm, is launching a wrapped version of XRP, called wXRP, expanding the token\u2019s reach into the DeFi ecosystem. Simply put, XRP liquidity is no longer confined to Ripple-led rails.\nInstead, the firm has selected Solana [SOL] as the chain for wXRP, making this a textbook cross-chain move. In effect, XRP\u2019s DeFi use case is shifting from its native L1 to Solana, allowing it to tap into deeper on-chain activity.\nData from DeFiLlama backs this move, reinforcing Solana\u2019s infrastructure.\nFor example, Solana\u2019s 24H DEX volume sat at $3.9 billion at press time. That\u2019s about 575x higher than XRPL\u2019s $6.78 million. Consequently, shifting wXRP to Solana boosts its on-chain liquidity, making it far more usable for traders.\nThat said, while this move showcases Solana\u2019s on-chain strength, it also raises questions about XRPL\u2019s limitations. Simply put, does the wXRP launch highlight XRPL\u2019s relative weakness in supporting DeFi activity?\nwXRP launch gives XRP a strategic edge in DeFi\nRipple is making 2025 its year to push for mainstream adoption.\nPrimarily, by targeting the payments market, Ripple\u2019s native token has become more liquid. But the on-chain impact is still limited. Total Value Locked (TVL) on XRPL sat at just $69 million, as of writing, slipping back to June levels.\nOther metrics show a similar trend. Despite RLUSD, the total stablecoin market cap on XRPL is just $343 million. By comparison, Solana\u2019s TVL sat at $17 billion, making it clear which L1 currently offers much deeper liquidity.\nIn this context, Hex Trust\u2019s wXRP launch looks like a smart strategic pivot.\nWith Ripple expanding financial adoption, institutional demand for XRP is on the rise, supported by ETF inflows. Against this setup, wXRP acts as a bridge, giving traders and institutions easier access to XRP liquidity.\nHowever, by launching on Solana, the token taps into deeper liquidity, giving it a clear edge in the DeFi ecosystem, positioning it to interact with a wider range of protocols and support larger on-chain flows.\nFinal Thoughts\n- Hex Trust\u2019s wXRP launch moves XRP liquidity from its native L1 to Solana, significantly enhancing on-chain activity.\n- Solana\u2019s 24H DEX volume is roughly 575x higher than XRPL\u2019s, giving wXRP deeper liquidity and broader protocol integration opportunities."

A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Solana Meme Coins\nLet\u2019s say we want to launch a new memecoin on the market.\nBut here\u2019s the kicker, we don\u2019t know how to code, and we have barely any money to invest in its launch.\nFor illustrative purposes only, let\u2019s say we want to create the BitOinc memecoin. It\u2019s a Bitcoin typo, and also a pig memecoin \u2014 that will do it, probably. We could even have its logo as a Bitcoin\u2019s \u201c\u20bf\u201d but sideways, so it resembles a pig\u2019s snout.\nBut in order to have BitOinc live on-chain, we\u2019d need to somehow actually launch it.\nSo, in order to launch our memecoin, the best route would be to use a launchpad. And what better launchpad to use than the most hyped and popular in the market?\nIn this Pump.fun review, we\u2019re gonna cover everything there is to know about the platform, and also go through how to launch your own token.\nWhat is Pump.fun\nPump.fun is a token launchpad on the Solana blockchain. The platform was one of the first to have a focus on memecoins. Enthusiasts all around the world get on the platform to buy, trade, and create their own tokens.\nAt its core, Pump.fun is seen as the easiest and accessible option for anyone wanting to launch or get in touch with the \u201cunderground\u201d memecoin community. Because of this simplicity, Pump.fun has become wildly popular among retail traders and meme coin enthusiasts worldwide.\nMost importantly, the platform lives and breathes at the birthplace of the hottest memecoin trends: the Solana Blockchain. Solana has become the chain of choice for meme coins thanks to its low fees and lightning\u2011fast transactions, and Pump.fun sits right at the center of that culture.\nSolana Meme Coins\nSolana has become the go-to chain for memecoins because it offers lower fees, fast transactions, and a thriving community of enthusiasts and developers.\nWhile Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, it has gradually lost ground in the meme coin arena. High gas fees and slower transaction speeds make it expensive and clunky for retail traders who want to launch or trade tokens on a whim.\nThat explains why Solana became the hottest spot for memes. And platforms like Pump.fun supercharged this shift by democratizing the token-creation process, allowing millions of new tokens to emerge over the last few years.\nBut What is a Token Launchpad\nA token launchpad is nothing more than a platform that helps new projects create, advertise, and list tokens without needing deep technical expertise or large amounts of capital.\nIf launching your own crypto was like creating your own software back in the day, then a token launchpad is the equivalent of modern app stores or website builders. Instead of writing thousands of lines of code, you get a ready\u2011made toolkit.\nFor memecoins, which thrive on community \u2014 launchpads also act as a social amplifier. On top of doing most of the background work required to create a cryptocurrency, they also provide projects with immediate visibility and a stage where communities can rally.\nHow Pumpfun Works\nPump.Fun operates as an automated token factory on Solana. When someone launches a coin on the platform, Pump.Fun automatically deploys a SPL token contract (Solana\u2019s equivalent of ERC\u201120 on Ethereum) with predefined parameters like name, symbol, and supply.\nOnce the token exists, Pump.fun doesn\u2019t rely on traditional order books or presales. Instead, it plugs the token into a bonding curve smart contract.\nPumpfun Bonding Curve\nOnce the token exists, it still has to go through some processes until it becomes a fully tradable asset in the wider Solana ecosystem. At first, the token is bound to Pump.fun\u2019s bonding curve contract.\nThe bonding curve period acts as both the distribution mechanism and the initial liquidity pool. This period is basically the \u201ctest drive\u201d for memecoins, where the token gets its first sense of demand and liquidity.\nBuyers at the start of the curve can buy tokens at a discount. And as liquidity accumulates, the price for said token "

The announcement was made by the Foundation's Vibhu Norby amid Solana Breakpoint 2025, the biggest Solana community conference.\nvibhu@vibhuDec 12, 2025In November, I unexpectedly became enemy #1 of the XRP Army.\nThrough the resulting public learning process, I had a chance to meet many OG devs, core community members, memelords, and the team at Ripple itself, and I came to an understanding of the uniqueness of XRP as an asset,\u2026 https://t.co/BnfRhFQV6E\nAs explained by Vibhu in his X post, with this bridge, XRP will be available in Solana SOLUSD dApps like a regular Solana-based asset. It means that XRP liquidity will be able to debut in every DeFi protocol on Solana SOLUSD.\nNamely, XRP holders will be able to earn yield by lending their coins, act as liquidity providers with XRP-SOL and other pairs, buy tokenized stocks and RWAs, participate in prediction markets and much more.\nThe bridge will be launched using LayerZero and HexTrust tech developments with non-custodial design from day one:\nAnd like any good bridge, your XRP on Solana is always redeemable 1:1 for XRP on the ledger itself. It is self-custodial from end to end.\nAs a result, the XRP community will be able to benefit from their holdings with no need for routing on centralized exchanges, Vibhu concluded.\nCommunity shows moderate optimism\nThe announcement was met with general optimism by both the XRP army and the Solana community. Enthusiasts from both camps believe that XRP integration with Solana SOLUSD will bring more users and liquidity to Solana DeFi.\nAs covered by U.Today previously, this September, XRP Ledger received one more mechanism of integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains.\nThe first ever stablecoin that can be minted with XRP as a collateral went live on EVM L1 Flare. Thanks to Flare's DeFi Enosys, XRP-backed assets can be used in DeFi on EVM."

                "body": "The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate last week as experts had expected, boosting hopes for a \"Santa rally.\" But it remains to be seen whether the year-end market can keep its upward momentum.\nThis week (Dec. 15\u201319), major U.S. economic indicators will be released one after another, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is scheduled to decide its benchmark rate. With the debate over an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble simmering down, Micron's earnings are also in focus.\nThis week also brings a string of major events, including the release of U.S. employment and inflation data and rate decisions by major Central Banks such as the BOJ. On top of that, Micron's earnings, seen as a \"weathervane\" for memory semiconductors, are drawing investors' attention.\nLast week (Dec. 8\u201312), the domestic stock market rebounded on the back of a tailwind from U.S. rate cuts. The KOSPI started at 4,109.25 and closed at 4,167.16 on the 12th, up 1.41%. During the same period, the KOSDAQ rose 0.95% and finished trading around 937.\nThe biggest question for investors is whether the rally can continue this week. U.S. major economic indicators that were delayed by the government shutdown will be released in a concentrated batch this week. In particular, the November nonfarm payrolls (NFP), due on the night of the 16th (Korea time), is a key variable. If the market consensus of about 50,000 new jobs is met, expectations for additional easing by the Fed could gain more traction.\nThen on the 18th, the November consumer price index (CPI) will be released, followed by the November personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on the 19th.\nMonetary policy decisions by major Central Banks convening right after the U.S. rate cut are also expected to heighten market volatility. According to Mirae Asset Securities, the Bank of England (BOE) is seen favoring a rate cut, the European Central Bank (ECB) a hold, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) a rate hike. The BOE and ECB will announce results on the 18th, and the BOJ on the 19th.\nAttention is particularly focused on the BOJ's currency policy. The BOJ is set to decide the benchmark rate on the 19th, after Governor Kazuo Ueda already hinted at the possibility of a hike. As yen funding expense rises, concerns are growing over an \"yen carry trade\" unwind that could spur capital outflows from global markets.\nWoo Hye-young, a researcher at LS Securities, said, \"The market has largely priced in the possibility that the BOJ will raise rates further, but uncertainty remains over the pace of normalization afterward,\" adding, \"Given the rigid labor market, the prolonged weakness of the yen, and inflationary pressures, there is ample justification and need for additional hikes.\"\nOn the 18th, Micron's earnings, the \"weathervane for memory,\" will also be released. Depending on Micron's results, expectations are rising that the justification for artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor valuation (corporate value assessment) will be reaffirmed. It will also offer a read on the business conditions of Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, whose business structures are similar to Micron's.\nThere is also speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump could make a \"surprise decision.\" Daishin Securities Co.'s research center said, \"Given U.S. President Donald Trump's emphasis on political events, there is a possibility he will nominate the next Fed chair around Christmas,\" adding, \"another reason a year-end Santa rally could arrive.\""

After a week defined by a US rate cut, a surprise dip in UK GDP, and a late-week wobble tied to \u201cAI bubble\u201d nerves on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 now turn to a dense UK data run\u2014labour market, inflation, and retail sales\u2014plus a short but potentially market-moving corporate diary (including Currys, Bunzl, Hollywood Bowl, IntegraFin, and WH Smith).

The same session also carried a reminder that the UK consumer remains under pressure\u2014Aldi\u2019s UK boss pointed to shoppers spreading the cost of Christmas by buying earlier and switching from meals out to dining in. [2]\nTuesday (9 Dec): Defence and metals up; consumer signals downbeat\nLondon\u2019s blue chips finished essentially flat, supported by precious metals miners and defence names. BAE Systems rose after a report suggested German lawmakers were set to approve record defence contracts, while Barclays\u2019 card spending data highlighted a weak consumer backdrop. [3]\nWednesday (10 Dec): Banks take the lead ahead of the Fed\nThe FTSE 100 edged up with banks outperforming, helped by broker upgrades to lenders including HSBC and Standard Chartered. Outside the banks, the session also delivered stock-specific moves in FirstGroup (linked to a London Overground contract) and Evoke (strategic options review). [4]\nThursday (11 Dec): Fed cut lands; UK stocks rise but \u201cAI angst\u201d flickers\nUK equities rose after the Fed cut rates by 25bp. Even with Wall Street wobbling on concerns about big-ticket AI investment, London saw strength in precious metal miners and selected UK names on upgrades and idiosyncratic news (including a notable drop in Ceres Power after a short position was disclosed). [5]\nFriday (12 Dec): UK GDP disappoints, miners jump\u2014then Wall Street spoils the party\nFriday encapsulated the current market tension: UK stocks were initially buoyed by a surge in precious metal miners as gold and silver rallied, but the FTSE 100 ultimately closed lower as a Wall Street selloff\u2014sparked by renewed worries about frothy AI expectations\u2014hit risk appetite. The same day, UK-focused headlines mattered: UK GDP data showed the economy unexpectedly shrunk in the three months to October, reinforcing expectations of a BoE cut, while Card Factory issued a warning tied to weaker-than-expected store sales and concerns over footfall. [6]\nThe big catalyst: Bank of England decision on 18 December\nWhat markets are expecting\nThe Bank of England\u2019s next Monetary Policy Committee decision is due Thursday, 18 December, with the policy summary and minutes scheduled for 12:00 noon UK time. [7]\nAcross the coverage from 8\u201313 December, the consensus hardened:\n- A 25bp cut to 3.75% is widely expected, according to a Reuters poll of economists. [8]\n- Market pricing during the week repeatedly clustered around high odds of a December cut (figures cited ranged from the mid\u201180s to around 90%, depending on the day and source). [9]\nThis expectation is anchored in three signals repeatedly cited by strategists and reporters:\n- Cooling activity (underscored by the weak GDP print), [10]\n- Signs of labour-market softening, [11]\n- Disinflation progress\u2014even if inflation remains above target. [12]\nWhy the BoE decision could still surprise markets\nEven when a cut is \u201cpriced,\u201d the vote split and guidance can be the real market mover.\n- The BoE\u2019s November decision was narrowly balanced (a tight v"

                "body": "Germany\u2019s DAX heads into the week of Dec. 15\u201319, 2025 after a choppy stretch marked by a U.S. Fed cut, rising bond yields, and renewed \u201cAI bubble\u201d worries. Here\u2019s what to watch in Frankfurt: the ECB meeting, Germany\u2019s Ifo survey, key stock stories, and market levels.\nFRANKFURT | Dec. 13, 2025 \u2014 Germany\u2019s stock market enters the final full pre\u2011Christmas week with investors balancing two competing narratives: supportive global rate cuts on one hand, and a fresh bout of valuation anxiety around AI and higher long\u2011dated yields on the other. That tension was visible all week in the DAX\u2019s push\u2011and\u2011pull around the 24,000 area, with rallies repeatedly tested by bond-market moves and tech-led risk aversion. [1]\nNext week (Dec. 15\u201319) raises the stakes. The European Central Bank\u2019s year-end policy meeting lands on Thursday, with markets newly alert to hawkish signals after comments from prominent policy hawks raised the possibility that the ECB\u2019s next move could be a hike rather than a cut. Germany also gets a major sentiment checkpoint via the Ifo Business Climate survey on Wednesday. Add the Bank of England decision the same day as the ECB, a Bank of Japan meeting that has traders on edge, and the typical liquidity fade into the holidays\u2014and Frankfurt is set up for outsized swings even if headlines look \u201croutine.\u201d [2]\nBelow is a comprehensive roundup of the key news, forecasts, and market analyses published during Dec. 8\u201313, 2025, and how they feed into the Germany stock market week ahead.\nWhat moved Germany\u2019s stock market this week (Dec. 8\u201313, 2025)\n1) Bond yields and the ECB shifted from background noise to a market driver\nThe week opened with higher long-dated yields weighing on rate\u2011sensitive areas, as investors focused on fiscal sustainability worries globally. Reuters flagged Germany\u2019s 30\u2011year yield at its highest since 2011 early in the week\u2014an important signal for equity valuation because higher discount rates can pressure long-duration sectors and real estate. [3]\nAt the same time, investors were forced to reassess the ECB\u2019s direction. Reuters reported that ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel suggested the next move could be a hike (even if not imminent), a shift that helped push euro-zone yields higher and reset expectations for 2026. [4]\nWhy it matters for the DAX: Germany\u2019s flagship index is heavy in global industrials, exporters, and cyclicals that often like stable growth and a supportive credit impulse\u2014but it also contains companies whose valuations can be sensitive to long rates. A sustained rise in Bund yields can cap equity upside even in a \u201csoft landing\u201d narrative.\n2) German data gave mixed signals: a strong industrial-print, but no clear upturn\nOn the macro front, Germany\u2019s industrial production rose 1.8% in October, far above the Reuters-polled consensus of 0.4%, helped by construction and a broader manufacturing pickup. But economists quoted in the same report stressed that structural headwinds still point to sideways movement rather than a clear recovery. [5]\nSeparately, euro zone sentiment data showed a small improvement overall\u2014but Germany remained a drag: the Sentix reading for Germany weakened, and Sentix described Germany as a \u201cstumbling block\u201d for the region\u2019s momentum. [6]\nWhat investors took from it: Germany can still produce upside surprises in hard data, but sentiment and forward-looking indicators are not yet signaling a durable acceleration\u2014keeping the DAX more dependent on global factors (rates, China demand, U.S. tech risk appetite) than on domestic growth.\n3) A warning flare from the real economy: insolvencies projected at decade highs\nA major domestic headline came from Creditreform\u2019s report projecting 23,900 corporate insolvencies in 2025 (up 8.3% from 2024), the highest since 2014, alongside rising consumer insolvencies. Creditreform cited high costs, bureaucracy, and persistent economic weakness as core pressures, especially for SMEs. [7]\nMarket relevance: While insolvencies do not hit the DAX one-"

[1]\nAfter Friday\u2019s pullback, the DAX ended the week still hovering around the 24,200 area, but sentiment has clearly become more selective: investors rotated into cyclicals and financials on easier U.S. policy expectations, while questioning whether the AI investment boom is getting ahead of near-term returns. [2]\nThis \u201cweek ahead\u201d briefing brings together the most market-moving news, forecasts, and analyses published from 8\u201313 December 2025, then maps out the catalysts that could set the tone for Frankfurt trading in the days ahead.\nWhere the DAX left off: Fed relief meets AI reality check\nThe German market\u2019s late-week mood swing was visible across Europe. On Friday, 12 December, European shares reversed earlier gains as Wall Street weakened amid renewed \u201cAI bubble\u201d fears. Germany\u2019s DAX closed 0.34% lower, while the regional STOXX 600 finished the week flat\u2014suggesting the broader rally is losing momentum as investors demand clearer earnings payoff from headline themes. [3]\nThe trigger was not Germany-specific\u2014Broadcom\u2019s margin warning and Oracle\u2019s weaker outlook reignited doubts over the profitability of the AI buildout\u2014but it mattered for Frankfurt because the DAX has been supported by global risk appetite and tech-adjacent optimism. Reuters quoted Swissquote\u2019s Ipek Ozkardeskaya describing a \u201cclear loss of appetite for technology stocks,\u201d with Europe\u2019s smaller tech weight limiting the damage\u2014but not eliminating it. [4]\nAt the same time, the Fed\u2019s move has kept the \u201crates tailwind\u201d alive for equities, especially banks and cyclicals. IG\u2019s week-ahead analysis noted investors shifting away from technology and toward cyclicals/value after the Fed\u2019s 25 bp cut and guidance that was \u201cless hawkish than many had anticipated.\u201d [5]\nFor German investors, that sets up a familiar question for the coming week: Does the DAX resume its climb on policy easing optimism\u2014or does risk aversion broaden if AI and growth concerns spread?\nThe key Germany-linked stories from 8\u201313 December that shaped sentiment\n1) Germany\u2019s economic pulse: a \u201cstabilisation\u201d story, not a breakout\nSeveral Germany-focused data points over the week reinforced the idea that the economy is steadying, but not surging:\n- Industrial production (October): Germany\u2019s industrial output rose 1.8% month-on-month, beating forecasts for a smaller increase. However, Reuters cited analysts warning that this doesn\u2019t yet signal a durable recovery, with output still well below prior peaks and structural headwinds still present. [6]\n- Inflation (November): Germany\u2019s harmonised inflation was confirmed at 2.6%, up from 2.3% in October\u2014important because it feeds directly into expectations for ECB policy and real consumer demand into 2026. [7]\n- Investor morale: The euro zone Sentix index improved modestly, but Germany remained a drag. Reuters reported Germany\u2019s Sentix reading deteriorated further (with a notably weak \u201ccurrent situation\u201d component), underlining that the region\u2019s largest economy is still struggling to translate global momentum into domestic traction. [8]\nWhy it matters for the DAX: In December, markets are already leaning forward into 2026. If data continues to show \u201cstabilisation without acceleration,\u201d the DAX may become increasingly dependent on monetary policy messaging and global risk appetite rather than a homegrown growth engine.\n2) Central banks and bond yields: ECB \u201chawkishness\u201d returns to the conversation\nA major undercurrent this week was the shift in European rate expectations after comments by ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel. Reuters highlighted that her remarks \u201copened the door\u201d to a rate hike as the next move\u2014an eye-catching contrast to the Fed\u2019s easing path\u2014and that mar"

                "body": "Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), since the last five years saw the share price fall 55%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 26% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 10% in the last 90 days.\nIf the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for Skyworks Solutions isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nLooking back five years, both Skyworks Solutions' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 7.9% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 15% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Skyworks Solutions' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Skyworks Solutions the TSR over the last 5 years was -49%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nA Different Perspective\nWhile the broader market gained around 14% in the last year, Skyworks Solutions shareholders lost 23% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Skyworks Solutions better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

                "body": "Nasdaq Nordic markets head into the week of December 15\u201319, 2025 with a familiar late-year mix: thin liquidity, policy-driven sector rotation, and index-related flows. Trading between December 8\u201313, 2025 delivered a clear regional split\u2014Denmark outperformed, Sweden ended essentially flat, and Finland slipped\u2014while investors digested a Federal Reserve decision, repositioned around cyclical leadership, and reacted to a cluster of Nordic corporate headlines spanning new targets, a proposed delisting, and fresh First North trading. [1]\nBelow is what mattered in Nasdaq Nordic from Dec. 8\u201313, and what to watch next week as markets approach a key OMXC25 index change and a potentially market-moving run of delayed U.S. data.\nNasdaq Nordic at a glance: Sweden flat, Finland soft, Denmark strong\nStockholm (OMXS30): sideways week, policy-sensitive positioning.\nSweden\u2019s large-cap benchmark spent the week oscillating in a narrow band, ending almost unchanged from Monday\u2019s close. The OMXS30 finished Dec. 12 at 2,821.01, versus 2,823.91 on Dec. 8 (about -0.10% for the week). The week\u2019s range was tight: a low around 2,808.73 (Dec. 9) and a high around 2,829.04 (Dec. 11).\nHelsinki (OMXH25): gains early, sharp Friday drop.\nFinland\u2019s OMXH25 posted small advances through midweek before slipping hard into Friday. The index ended Dec. 12 at 5,504.46, down from 5,542.66 on Dec. 8 (roughly -0.69%). MarketScreener\u2019s real-time feed also showed elevated activity later in the week, with volumes rising into Thursday and Friday.\nCopenhagen (OMXC25): best performer, powered by a midweek surge.\nDenmark\u2019s OMXC25 was the clear winner in the Nordics for this window. Based on published closes, the index rose from 1,761.45 on Dec. 8 to 1,809.34 on Dec. 12 (about +2.7%), with the largest jump on Dec. 11 (+1.87%).\nThe takeaway for the week ahead: Nordic dispersion is back\u2014and that often persists when the market narrative is dominated by rates expectations and index/flow mechanics rather than broad earnings momentum.\nThe macro backdrop from Dec. 8\u201313: Fed-led rotation meets year-end conditions\n1) The \u201cwait for the Fed\u201d mood shaped early-week Stockholm trading\nStockholm started the week with caution as investors positioned for a U.S. rate decision expected midweek. In a Dec. 8 market report, trading was described as cautious heading into the Federal Reserve announcement, with only small moves at the index level. [2]\n2) What mattered after the decision: rotation signals, not just the cut\nBy the end of the week, global markets were still parsing what the Fed move meant for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d Reuters\u2019 Dec. 12 \u201cweek ahead\u201d note emphasized that investors were looking to a fresh wave of delayed U.S. economic releases\u2014including the November jobs report (Tuesday) and CPI (Thursday)\u2014after a 43-day U.S. federal government shutdown disrupted the normal data calendar. Reuters also noted the Fed had cut rates again, while implying future cuts could pause pending more clarity.\nThis matters for Nasdaq Nordic because the region\u2019s flagship indices have heavy exposure to:\n- Rate-sensitive sectors (banks and property/real estate),\n- Globally cyclical industrials (engineering and capital goods),\n- Large healthcare and medtech names (especially in Denmark and Sweden).\nIn practice, when the market is trying to decide whether the next phase is \u201csoft landing\u201d or renewed slowdown risk, Nordic equities can swing on global rate and FX impulses as much as on local fundamentals.\nSweden\u2019s key stories (Nasdaq Stockholm): targets, takeover talk, and a Main Market ambition\nStockholm\u2019s index was flat, but the news flow wasn\u2019t. Several Sweden-linked headlines during Dec. 8\u201313 were meaningful because they touch the mechanics of how capital is raised, how companies graduate between Nasdaq Nordic venues, and why certain shares get absorbed (or removed) from public markets.\nHusqvarna set longer-term targets\u2014and the market initially frowned\nOn Dec. 10, Husqvarna presented new financial and sustainability targets"

                "body": "Future control of Washington D.C.\u2019s three municipal golf courses is in limbo amid the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to make its mark on the city\u2019s public spaces.\nSince 2020, East Potomac, Rock Creek and Langston golf courses have been operated by National Links Trust, a nonprofit seeking to renovate the courses and provide affordable, accessible public golf in the city. The organization holds a 50-year lease with the National Park Service to rehabilitate land that has long needed attention.\nAdvertisement\nThat lease is now in question.\nThe Trump administration, via the Interior Department, has issued a formal notice of default, claiming the nonprofit is in violation of the deal and openly threatening to seize control of the properties.\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, President Donald Trump said National Links Trust has until the end of the month to address alleged violations of the lease, or the courses will come under the administration\u2019s control. Trump told the Journal he is uninterested in working with the group.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re looking to do is just build something di\ufb00erent,\u201d Trump told the Journal, \u201cand build them in government.\u201d\nThe administration told the Wall Street Journal that National Links Trust isn\u2019t following a fast enough timeline for its renovation projects, and is therefore in breach of its lease agreement. But the lease\u2019s \u201cInitial Improvements\u201d section, obtained by The Athletic, states that National Links Trust\u2019s timelines are \u201cgeneral and subject to change due to compliance timeframes or other circumstances.\u201d\nWork to date has involved fundraising as well as preparing the sites, including removing invasive vegetation and some tree removal. A miniature golf course has been completed at East Potomac.\nIn a statement Friday night, National Links Trust disagreed with the assertion that it is not upholding the lease and said it\u2019s hoping to work with the administration on the projects.\n\u201cNational Links Trust appreciates the President\u2019s interest in the DC golf course and looks forward to the opportunity to partner with the administration to improve these historically significant facilities,\u201d the NLT statement said. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the characterization that we are in default of our lease.\u201d\nAccording to a source with knowledge of communication between National Links Trust and the administration, granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, the nonprofit has presented \u201cnumerous proposals\u201d to partner with the administration in the redevelopment projects but received a \u201ctotal lack of response to that outreach.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe National Park Service and the Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A message left with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was not returned.\nThe National Links Trust declined to comment beyond its statement.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s interest in Washington\u2019s public golf courses is part of a larger plan to revamp the capital\u2019s footprint, including the controversial construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the now-demolished site of the East Wing.\nIn late October, following the demolition of the East Wing, truckloads of dirt and debris from the worksite were hauled to East Potomac and dumped on the course, the first sign of the administration\u2019s inroads onto the property.\nEast Potomac is believed to be at the center of Trump\u2019s attention. The 36-hole facility is the closest golf course to the White House and Capitol Hill, and sits between the Potomac River and the Washington Channel. At the heart of the property is the Blue Course, a reversible Walter Travis design dating to 1918. The course, with its history, location and clear views of the Washington Monument, has limitless potential. It is also rife with issues, including significant drainage problems and a seawall needing extensive repairs.\nSuch issues, and the exhaustive work and fundraising they require, were primary factors in t"

The decision, which is expected on Dec. 19, would take Japanese interest rates to their highest level in roughly 30 years.\nThe broader impact on global markets remains uncertain; however, developments in Japan have historically been bearish for bitcoin\nThe yen is currently trading near 156 against the U.S. dollar, slightly stronger than its late November peak just above 157.\nThe BoJ rate hike is said to have implications for the yen carry and could impact BTC via the equities channel.\nFor decades, hedge funds and trading desks have borrowed yen at ultra-low or even negative rates to finance positions in higher beta assets, mostly tech stocks and U.S. Treasury notes, a strategy enabled by Japan\u2019s prolonged period of loose monetary policy.\nThe theory, therefore, is that a higher Japanese rate could dent the attractiveness of these carry trades and reverse the money flow, leading to broad-based risk aversion in stocks and cryptocurrencies.\nThese fears are not unfounded. The last BOJ hike, which lifted rates to 0.5% on July 31, 2024, led to the yen rally and massive risk aversion in early August that saw BTC slide from roughly $65,000 to $50,000.\nThis time could be different\nThe impending hike may not lead to risk-off for two reasons. First, speculators are already holding net long (bullish) exposure in the yen, which makes a snap reaction to the BoJ hike unlikely. In mid-2024, speculators were bearish on yen, according to CFTC data tracked by Investing.com.\nSecondly, Japanese bond yields have risen throughout this year, hitting multi-decade highs at both the short and long ends of the curve. The upcoming rate hike, therefore, reflects official rates catching up with the market.\nMeanwhile, this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points to a three-year low on top of introducing liquidity measures. The dollar index has dropped to a seven-week low.\nTaken together, these things suggest low odds of a pronounced \"JPY carry unwind\" and year-end risk aversion.\nThat said, Japan's fiscal situation, with debt-to-GDP ratio of 240%, warrants close monitoring next year as a potential source of market volatility.\n\"Under PM Sanae Takaichi, a big fiscal expansion and tax cuts arrive while inflation hovers near 3% and the BoJ keeps rates too low, still acting as if Japan were stuck in deflation. With high debt and rising inflation expectations, investors question BoJ credibility, JGB yields steepen, the yen weakens, and Japan starts to look more like a fiscal crisis story than a safe haven,\" MacroHive said in a market update.\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines.

                "body": "Published: December 13, 2025\nTokyo\u2019s stock market heads into the week of December 15\u201319 with the Topix at a record closing high and investors increasingly focused on a Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy decision that markets have largely priced in\u2014but may not be fully prepared to interpret. The Nikkei 225 ended Friday (Dec. 12) at 50,836.55, while the Topix closed at 3,423.83, its highest close on record, after a broad rally that followed the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s latest 25-basis-point rate cut. [1]\nNow comes the harder part for traders: navigating the messaging\u2014not just the move\u2014out of the BOJ, with inflation data due just hours before the decision and the yen poised to swing on any hint of how far and how fast Japan\u2019s rate-normalisation cycle could run. [2]\nWhere Tokyo stands after December 8\u201312: record Topix, choppy Nikkei, and a market pulled in three directions\nThe Tokyo market\u2019s mood this past week can be summarised in three competing forces:\n- Central-bank crosscurrents: the Fed cutting rates while the BOJ prepares to hike.\n- Yen sensitivity: exporters and global cyclicals like weakness; domestic, rate-sensitive sectors don\u2019t.\n- AI/tech valuation nerves: periodic shocks from U.S. mega-cap earnings and guidance continue to spill into Tokyo\u2019s heavyweight tech complex.\nMonday, Dec. 8: steady yen helps the broad market, SoftBank drags the Nikkei\nTokyo stocks started the week cautiously ahead of the Fed meeting. The Nikkei rose 0.2% to 50,581.94, while the Topix gained 0.7% to 3,384.31, supported by a rebound in property shares and a pause in yen strength\u2014though declines in heavyweight names limited the upside. [3]\nA key tell for positioning: real estate jumped, while banks lagged, reflecting the market\u2019s tug-of-war between \u201crates up\u201d and \u201crisk-on.\u201d [4]\nTuesday, Dec. 9: chips lift, investors wait on the Fed\u2014and watch Japanese yields\nOn Tuesday, the market remained in \u201cwait-and-see\u201d mode ahead of the Fed decision, but chip-linked gains helped keep Tokyo supported. The Nikkei ended at 50,655.10 and the Topix at 3,384.92. [5]\nMeanwhile, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda drew attention by saying recent rises in Japanese long-term rates had been \u201csomewhat rapid,\u201d adding the central bank could increase bond buying if yields moved sharply in abnormal fashion\u2014comments that fed directly into bank, property and yen-sensitive positioning. [6]\nWednesday, Dec. 10: Topix hits an intraday record, momentum fades into the Fed\nWednesday delivered a clear headline: the Topix set an intraday all-time high of 3,408.99, before cooling and finishing at 3,389.02; the Nikkei slipped 0.1% to 50,602.80. [7]\nStrategists pointed again to the yen\u2019s role: a weaker yen tailwind can lift exporters and autos, but the sustainability of that lift depends on whether the yen continues depreciating or stabilises as Fed expectations settle. [8]\nThursday, Dec. 11: Oracle shock hits Tokyo\u2014SoftBank slides, tech drags\nThursday was the week\u2019s risk-off reminder. Tokyo fell as SoftBank Group tracked a sharp drop in Oracle after the U.S. firm\u2019s results and guidance revived concerns about the payback period on AI infrastructure spending. The Nikkei closed down 0.9% at 50,148.82 and the Topix fell 0.94% to 3,357.24 after opening at a record high. [9]\nThe global spillover mattered: Reuters\u2019 broader market wrap noted the Oracle drop weighed on tech sentiment and hit Japan\u2019s Nikkei, led by SoftBank\u2019s decline. [10]\nFriday, Dec. 12: Fed cut boosts risk appetite; Topix logs record close\nFriday flipped the script. After the Fed cut rates again, Tokyo rallied strongly. The Nikkei gained 1.4% to close at 50,836.55, and the Topix jumped 2% to 3,423.83, a record closing high. [11]\nBut Friday\u2019s strength came with a caution label: Reuters noted attention is now shifting to what the BOJ says next\u2014especially with the Nikkei still wrestling with the psychologically important 51,000 level. [12]\nThe big theme for the week ahead: it\u2019s not just whether the BOJ hikes\u2014it\u2019s how it frames the hiking path\nBy the en"

                "body": "The Bank of Japan is likely to raise its short-term policy rate, the benchmark interest rate, from 0.5% to 0.75% at the upcoming financial policy-making meeting on the 18th and 19th. If interest rates rise, it will exceed the \"0.5% wall\" for the first time in 30 years since 1995.\nThe Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) reported on the 14th that more than half of the nine policy committee members participating in the rate decision support a rate hike. The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% at its January meeting, and has kept rates unchanged at all six meetings since then.\nAfter the bubble economy collapsed in the early 1990s, the Bank of Japan lowered the reserve ratio corresponding to the base rate in September 1995 from 1.0% to 0.5%. Since then, the benchmark interest rate has never exceeded 0.5%, so it has been called the \"0.5% wall.\"\n\"Even if interest rates are raised, it is still adjusted in an easing financial environment and does not put a brake on the economy,\" Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said in a recent external lecture.\nThere is also a sharp high price problem behind Japan's interest rate hike. As the yen per dollar remains in the 155 yen range, import prices soar, stimulating overall prices. The Bank of Japan expects a certain brake on the yen if the interest rate gap between the U.S. and Japan decreases due to a rate hike.\nThe market is paying attention to the pace of future interest rate hikes, with this month's rate hike a given fact. Experts believe that the rate is likely to eventually rise to the 1.0-1.5% level as the hike does not end in a single time and further increases follow.\nAccording to a survey of Japanese monetary policy experts conducted by Nikkei Quick News (NQN) from the 3rd to the 8th of this month, eight out of 29 respondents expected the Bank of Japan's benchmark interest rate to rise to 1.0% in the face of the rate hike.\nSeven economists each cited 1.25% and 1.5% as their final interest rates, with 76% of all respondents predicting that the Bank of Japan will raise its key interest rate to 1.0% to 1.5%.\nShinichiro Kobayashi, a senior researcher at Mitsubishi UFJ Research & Consulting, estimated, \"The benchmark interest rate will reach the top of 1% around July next year.\" \"After next summer, consumer price growth will remain below the Bank of Japan's 2% target, and the increase in interest costs due to interest rate hikes may lead to fiscal deterioration, so further increases will not be easy,\" he said.\nKazumi Kato, chief economist at Todan Research, predicted that the upper end of the benchmark interest rate will be 1.50% and the time of arrival will be December next year in this hike cycle. Considering the flow of prices and exchange rates, he presupposed that \"it would not be strange at all even if the base rate reached 2%,\" but predicted that the realistic top would be only 1.5% considering the burden of floating-rate mortgage loans by SMEs and households and the financial soundness of local financial institutions.\nThe NQN survey also asked about the expected interest rate on Japanese government bonds as of the end of 2026. \"The bond market has already reversed course and it is only a matter of time before the 10-year and 30-year rates reach 2%,\" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Yasuda General Research Institute, expecting 10-year and 30-year interest rates to be 2.00% and 3.40%, respectively."
