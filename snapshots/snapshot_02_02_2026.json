While recent depreciation has pushed the dollar closer to fair value, BCA says the greenback \"is still expensive,\" and faster earnings growth outside the U.S. has reduced the relative appeal of U.S. assets on a cyclical basis.\nPositioning and sentiment indicators continue to lean against the greenback, while the sharp rise in gold prices is also seen as an unfavorable signal for the dollar.\nAt the same time, MacroQuant has turned decisively constructive on commodities. Gold remains a core bullish call within the model, which \"has been very bullish on the yellow metal for most of the past two years,\u201d supported by central bank buying, strong long-term price momentum, positive sentiment and concerns over fiscal policy.\nAlthough overbought conditions are tempering the near-term score, the model continues to project positive returns.\nCopper has seen an even stronger shift in conviction. The firm highlights that the model \u201cis now extremely bullish on the red metal,\u201d reflecting an improved economic outlook in the U.S. alongside continued support from sentiment and price momentum indicators.\nThe oil score has \"increased meaningfully, moving into bullish territory,\u201d BCA stresses, driven by strong price momentum and heightened geopolitical tensions that have lifted crude prices. Beyond those risks, the model points to firm global growth signals, manufacturing data and the outperformance of cyclical equities as reinforcing a more positive oil outlook.\nOverall, \"the model has upgraded oil from extreme underweight to modest overweight, and copper from neutral to extreme overweight. It continues to be bullish on gold,\" BCA said.\nWhat are the best investment opportunities in 2026?\nThe best investments start with better data.

                "body": "A rally built on distrust and dollar pessimism\nIn the run-up to the crash, gold and silver had come to embody a broader loss of confidence in the US dollar and the institutions that manage it. Concerns over Federal Reserve independence, persistent geopolitical tensions from the Middle East to Latin America and a swelling US fiscal deficit combined to fuel demand for hard assets. Gold\u2019s surge to nearly $5,600 an ounce and silver\u2019s spike above $120 were seen as insurance against political and monetary disorder.\nThis narrative gathered momentum as Trump repeatedly criticised the dollar\u2019s strength and expressed a desire for looser monetary policy. Investors increasingly bet that the next Fed chair would be an ultra-dove, willing to cut rates aggressively and tolerate higher inflation. In that environment, holding non-yielding assets such as gold and silver made sense. As prices rose, speculative flows followed, amplifying the move in a feedback loop familiar from previous commodity manias.\nWhy Kevin Warsh changed the story\nWarsh\u2019s sudden emergence as the preferred candidate for Fed chair upended these expectations. Warsh, a former Fed governor, is widely seen as a policy hawk by recent standards. He has been sceptical of prolonged quantitative easing, wary of oversized central bank balance sheets, and more inclined to prioritise inflation control and currency credibility.\nFor a market priced for easy money and a weakening dollar, Warsh came as a shock. The prospect of a Fed leader less tolerant of inflation and more supportive of a stronger dollar immediately challenged the core thesis behind the metals rally. As the dollar turned higher when US markets opened on January 29, gold fell sharply, briefly losing more than $200 an ounce in minutes. When reports confirmed Trump\u2019s intention to nominate Warsh, selling intensified.\nWarsh himself did not need to promise tighter policy to trigger the move. His reputation alone was enough. He was not the ultra dove investors had been expecting. In markets driven as much by expectations as by fundamentals, that distinction mattered enormously.\nLeverage, margins and the mechanics of a crash\nWhile the Warsh nomination provided the narrative trigger, the scale of the collapse also owed to market structure. By late January, precious metals futures were heavily leveraged. When prices began to fall, margin calls forced traders to liquidate positions at speed. CME Group\u2019s decision to raise margin requirements on gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures added fuel to the fire.\nHigher margins increase the cost of holding futures positions, reducing speculative participation and forcing weaker hands out of the market. As leveraged investors scrambled to meet margin calls, they sold not only metals but also other assets, creating a cascade effect that far exceeded what the initial policy news might have justified. This dynamic explains why even seasoned observers were struck by the breathtaking speed of the decline. The Warsh nomination was the match and leverage was the inflammable gas that had been collecting.\nIn hindsight, the precious metals market was primed for a correction. Analysts had been warning for weeks that positioning was stretched and sentiment overheated. Scenes of retail buying from China to Germany, likened to the late-1970s gold boom, were classic late-cycle signals. Trump\u2019s comment days earlier that the dollar was \u201cdoing great\u201d had already sparked a final burst of buying, pushing prices to unsustainable extremes.\nAgainst that backdrop, almost any credible excuse could have prompted profit-taking. Warsh\u2019s nomination happened to be the one that arrived first and was the most convincing because it struck at the heart of the easy-money narrative.\nKevin Warsh alone could not collapse gold and silver to this extent. Expectations of future rate cuts have not vanished as investors still anticipate at least two cuts in 2026. Geopolitical risks remain unresolved, and questions about US fis"

Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

                "body": "Gold, silver ETFs recover up to 10% after crash: Analysts say long-term outlook remains bullish\nGold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) made a partial recovery on February 2, after crashing sharply earlier during the day. Analysts have expressed belief in the long-term bullish outlook for the precious metals, despite current volatility.\nEdelweiss Silver ETF, which had hit the 20 percent lower circuit earlier during the day, recovered nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 232.17 apiece, as seen at 10.30 am. Axis Silver ETF, which also crashed 20 percent earlier during the day, also recovered around 10 percent to trade at Rs 231.85 apiece.\nGold ETFs, which were down up to 9 percent in the early trading hours, were down up to 5 percent, as seen at 10.40 am. It is important to note that despite the partial recovery, most of the ETFs are still in the deep red.\nGold, silver prices recover:\nGold futures with March expiry on MCX, which fell to Rs 1,40,001 per 10 grams earlier during the day, recovered nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,43,800 per 10 grams.\nSilver futures however are yet to show notable rebound from day\u2019s lows.\nWhy are gold, silver prices falling today?\nGold and silver ETFs, which earlier saw a significant surge along with the precious metals, have seen a significant decline recently, with the trend continuing today as well. The sharp fall in gold and silver prices came amid rampant profit-booking, along with stronger dollar. US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to head the American central bank.\nAdditionally, CME Group announced hikes in margins on its metal futures on Saturday and the changes are set to take effect after market close on Monday. This will also likely weigh on precious metals. COMEX gold futures margins have been raised from 6 percent to 8 percent, while COMEX 5000 silver futures are set to increase to 15 percent from 11 percent.\nHere's what analysts say:\nThe recent \"flash crash\" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of \"overbought\" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza.\nHe however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. \u201cRecord central bank buying, silver\u2019s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,\u201d said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

These include hydrocarbon exploration and production, technological and field development innovations, oilfield services opportunities in Libya, crude supply and trading activities.\n\"We recognise Libya\u2019s oil and gas industry as a pillar of strength and expertise. I am sure that this new agreement will act as a catalyst for further expanding our international portfolio, creating clear mutual value for both companies and reinforcing the resilience of our region.

The company has oil and gas exploration and production assets in nine countries, with production in eight countries: in Croatia, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Russia, Pakistan, Egypt, and Hungary.\nThe agreement also reflects the hotting up of international interest in Libya. Chevron recently signed an MoU with NOC to evaluate exploration and development opportunities, while TotalEnergies has signed an agreement extending the Libya Waha Concessions up to 2050, paving the way for further investments. TGS has a global provider of energy data and intelligence, has just signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with North Africa Geophysical Company, (NAGECO),a subsidiary of the NOC to advance high-quality subsurface data, supporting Libya\u2019s upstream development through modern, fit-for-purpose data and technology solutions.

Saudi Arabia is the dominant consumer and importer, while Oman is the sole notable producer. The market is forecast to recover with a modest CAGR of +2.2% in volume and +3.2% in value through 2035. Import and export prices show significant variation between countries, with Turkey being the leading high-value exporter.\nKey Findings\n- Market forecast to grow at +2.2% volume CAGR to 9K tons by 2035, valued at $21M\n- Saudi Arabia leads consumption (50% share) and imports, with rapid growth over the past decade\n- Regional production is minimal, with Oman being the only producer (19 tons in 2024)\n- Imports fell sharply in 2024 (-48% to 7.4K tons) after a peak, ending a four-year rising trend\n- Turkey is the primary exporter, commanding 74% of export value with high unit prices\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by rising demand for crude coconut oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to start an upward consumption trend over the next decade. The performance of the market is forecast to increase slightly, with an anticipated CAGR of +2.2% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 9K tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +3.2% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $21M (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Crude Coconut (Copra) Oil\nAfter four years of growth, consumption of crude coconut (copra) oil decreased by -45.2% to 7.1K tons in 2024. In general, consumption saw a noticeable curtailment. As a result, consumption reached the peak volume of 13K tons, and then fell significantly in the following year.\nThe revenue of the crude coconut oil market in the Middle East reduced rapidly to $15M in 2024, dropping by -40.8% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). Over the period under review, consumption, however, showed a relatively flat trend pattern. As a result, consumption attained the peak level of $25M, and then reduced rapidly in the following year.\nConsumption By Country\nThe country with the largest volume of crude coconut oil consumption was Saudi Arabia (3.6K tons), accounting for 50% of total volume. Moreover, crude coconut oil consumption in Saudi Arabia exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest consumer, Turkey (1.5K tons), twofold. The third position in this ranking was taken by Yemen (540 tons), with a 7.6% share.\nIn Saudi Arabia, crude coconut oil consumption increased at an average annual rate of +38.5% over the period from 2013-2024. The remaining consuming countries recorded the following average annual rates of consumption growth: Turkey (-12.4% per year) and Yemen (+26.7% per year).\nIn value terms, Saudi Arabia ($6.8M) led the market, alone.

While he reportedly held off on an attack last month, the recent arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Middle East has raised expectations that a strike is imminent.\n\u201cWe would put 75% odds in the coming days to weeks there will be some sort of U.S. attack on Iran,\u201d Bob McNally, Rapidan Energy Group founder and former White House energy advisor, told CNBC on Thursday.\nBrent crude oil futures have jumped 5% in the past week and 14% since the start of the year. Prices have now broken their year-long pattern of a steady decline punctuated by brief spikes that quickly reverse to resume the downtrend, he noted.\nThe U.S. attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities last year only resulted in a temporary price surge as the conflict remained limited in scope and avoided the country\u2019s oil infrastructure.\nIn addition, the U.S. military raid last month to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro failed to move the needle much in oil markets as production wasn\u2019t interrupted.\n\u201cBut this one is real,\u201d McNally warned. \u201cThe markets are pricing the risk that this time the past will not indicate the future\u2014that we could have a sustained disruption in energy flows.\u201d\nIran pumped 4.7 million barrels per day last year, accounting for 4.4% of global oil supplies. Much of its heavily sanctioned shipments go to China via a so-called shadow fleet.\nBut the bigger risk centers on the potential for Iran to close off the Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth off all the world\u2019s oil and liquified natural gas passes through on the way to export markets.\nMarkets assume that the U.S. Navy could quickly clear any underwater mines or other threats that would prevent tankers from traversing the Strait of Hormuz, but McNally thinks that\u2019s a mistake.\nHe pointed out that the U.S. failed to completely pacify the threat from Houthi rebels, who attacked shipping in the Persian Gulf before Trump essentially reached a ceasefire agreement.\n\u201cIranians have much better weaponry and a better coastline to harass that strait, so God forbid it comes to that,\u201d McNally added.\nOn Sunday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader warned that any attack by the U.S. would spark a \u201cregional war\u201d in the Mideast, marking the most-direct threat he\u2019s made so far during Trump\u2019s military build-up in the area.\nBut sources told Axios that Trump administration told Tehran through back channels that it\u2019s open to meeting to negotiate a deal.\nMcNally on Thursday flagged the escalating rhetoric and highlighted the potential for upheaval in the LNG market in the event of an Iranian blockage of the strait.\n\u201cIf it lasts more than one or two days, the market will be shocked because we simply can\u2019t imagine a scenario where the U.S. military doesn\u2019t prevail militarily [and] overwhelmingly in hours to days,\u201d he predicted. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen it in history, but it\u2019s entirely possible. In that case, you will see the mother of all bidding on any spot cargoes for LNG.\u201d"

This move follows an earlier agreement in November 2025 to delay the restoration of voluntary output reductions.\nUnder the original plan, the group intended to gradually unwind 1.65 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of voluntary cuts. However, the producers have opted for a cautious approach due to expected seasonal weakness in oil demand during the first quarter.\nThe group reiterated that these volumes could still return to the market either partially or in full. This re-entry would happen only in a gradual manner and remains strictly dependent on evolving market conditions. The participating nations stressed that flexibility is central to their strategy, including the potential to extend the current pause or reverse future increases if necessary.\nIn addition to the current pause, the group emphasized the continued importance of the larger 2.2 million bbl/d of voluntary cuts announced in late 2023. These measures remain in place to support global market stability amid concerns over demand volatility and economic growth.\nThe eight producers reaffirmed their collective commitment to full compliance with the OPEC+ Declaration of Cooperation.

                "body": "EUR/USD hovers near lows with all eyes on US manufacturing activity\n- EUR/USD consolidates losses around 1.1850 after dropping by over 1% on Friday.\n- Eurozone and German HCOB manufacturing PMIs have been upwardly revised.\n- The US Dollar remains supported by the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair.\nThe Euro (EUR) posts marginal gains against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, moving at 1.1867 at the time of writing, despite rather positive data from the Eurozone. The Dollar holds its ground, supported by the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair, while a risk-averse market sentiment is weighing on the Euro.\nInvestors showed some relief after US President Donald Trump confirmed on Friday that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chairman when his term expires in May. Warsh is partidary of a smaller balance sheet and has advocated for lower borrowing costs in recent times, although he is expected to take a cautious approach to inflation.\nIn Europe, the final HCOB Manufacturing PMI readings revealed that the sector's activity improved beyond expectations in January. The Eurozone PMI has been revised up to 49.5, from previous estimations of 49.4, and also above December's 48.8 reading. In a similar line, German PMI has been revised up to 49.1. Preliminary estimations had shown a 48.7 reading, unchanged from the previous month.\nThe focus now will be on the US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMI) due later today. Investors, however, are likely to remain cautious ahead of a busy economic calendar this week, which includes the Eurozone Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decision on Thursday and the key US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday, among other relevant releases.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the Swiss Franc.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily Digest market Movers: The Dollar remains supported by Warsh's nomination\n- The market has reacted positively to the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chief. The market is forecasting at least two rate cuts in 2026, according to data from the CME Group's Fed Watch Tool, but Warsh has already served as a Fed Governor, and he was sensitive to inflation risks during his tenure.\n- German Retail Sales have shown a 0.1% growth in December, following a 0.5% decline in November and beating the market consensus that had anticipated a 0.2% drop. Year-on-year, German retail consumption accelerated by 1.5%, from 1.3% in the previous month. The impact of the data on the Euro has been minor.\n- In the US, January's ISM Manufacturing PMI is expected to show a moderate improvement to 48.3 from 47.9 in December, with prices paid accelerating to a four-month high of 60.5.\n- Later on, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will take the stage. Bostic has been reluctant to cut interest rates and recently affirmed that the balance sheet is \"about right\" last week, which brings to light the divergences within the central bank's committee.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD hovers above 1.1835 with bears in control\nThe EUR/USD is on a bearish correction, hovering near 1.1850 after pulling back from four-year highs near 1.2100. Technical indicators are pointing lower on the 4-hour chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below the key 50 level, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram shows expanding negative bars.\nThe pair has found some footing above the January 26 low, at the 1.1835 area, and the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the late-January rally, at 1.1830.

Our preference remains for a broader dollar sell-off occurring later in the year.\u201d\nThe dollar posted sharp losses early in the week with on-going unease over the geo-political stance, coupled with talk that the Administration would push for a weaker dollar.\nSave on Your EUR/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nIn this context, there was speculation that global hedge funds would increase their hedging ratios on US assets and EUR/USD surged to a 55-month high close to 1.2090.\nFed policy and potential threats to its independence remained a key element.\nThe Federal Reserve held rates at 3.75% with a slightly hawkish statement which helped stabilise the dollar and there was a more decisive recovery late in the week amid talk, later confirmed, that Kevin Warsh would be nominated as the next Fed Chair.\nEUR/USD retreated sharply to lows at 1.19 before stabilising.\nING commented; \u201cIt\u2019s good news for the dollar, which can price out some risks of a more dovish pick.\u201d\nRabobank commented; \u201cThe market may respond optimistically to the prospect of Warsh\u2019 nomination, but broader US policy uncertainty is still not doing the dollar any favours.\u201d\nUBS notes that the dollar has been under notable pressure due to fears over geo-political developments over Greenland and threats of additional tariffs.\nAccording to the bank; \u201cWe believe that the combination of these recent developments has prompted international investors to price in a USD risk premium. The sharp rally of gold or precious metals in general reflects investors\u2019 unease over political and geopolitical developments as of late.\u201d\nIt notes that the selling could continue in the near term, but is cautious over the potential for sustained losses\nAccording to the bank; \u201cpolicymakers are expected to push back against excessive USD weakness, just as European officials would resist an overly strong euro. Third, US economic data will likely prove robust enough to end the Fed\u2019s easing cycle in 1H26. Collectively, these factors make it hard for EURUSD to trade materially higher than 1.20 in the coming months.\u201d\nUBS also noted that there are important upside and downside dollar risks\nAccording to the bank; \u201cFurther turbulence at the Federal Reserve would open the door for a EURUSD closer to 1.25. Meanwhile, the prospect for renewed US exceptionalism and European growth failing to accelerate in 2026 could bring EURUSD to 1.15 or lower.\u201d\nLike this piece?

Join live on Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD Monthly\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In my last Euro Technical Forecast we noted that the early-month pullback in EUR/USD was, \u201capproaching confluent uptrend support. From a trading standpoint, the focus is on possible inflection into 1.1598- a reaction there will likely determine if the late-December pullback was simply a correction or whether a larger trend reversal will take shape into the start of the year.\u201d Price registered a close low at 1.1598 days later before rebounding sharply with EUR/USD marking an outside-weekly reversal off the low the following week.\nThe rally extended more than 4.3% off the January lows before exhausting into a major technical barrier this week at 1.1917-1.2020- a region defined by the 2025 swing high, the 100% extension of the 2022 advance, and the 38.2% retracement of the broader 2008 decline. Note that the upper parallel converges on this threshold over the next few weeks and the focus is on possible inflection off this zone into the start of February. The immediate advance may be vulnerable while below this threshold and a topside breach / weekly close above is ultimately needed to fuel the next major leg of the rally.\nInitial weekly support now rests at 1.1746/75- a region define by the objective yearly open, the 2025 high-week close (HWC) and the 2025 high-close. Medium-term bullish invalidation is now raised to the 75% parallel which converges on the January low-close at 1.1598. A break / weekly close below this slope would suggest a more significant high is in place and a larger correction is underway within the 2025 uptrend. Subsequent support rests with the March 220 and the 2022 high at 1.1497 and the April high-close at 1.1394.\nA weekly close above this key pivot zone would be needed to mark uptrend resumption and could fuel another bout of accelerated gains for the Euro. Subsequent resistance objectives are eyed at the 2021 HWC at 1.2218 and the 2021 swing high at 1.2350.\nBottom line: The Euro rally exhausted into uptrend resistance this week at key technical barrier- risk for major inflection off this zone into the start of the month. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 1.1746 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 1.2020 needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nKeep in mind key event risk is slated into start of February with the European Central Bank (ECB) rate decision and US Non-Farm Payrolls on tap next week. Stay nimble into the monthly cross and watch the weekly closes for guidance here.

He has historically voiced opposition for quantitative easing policies and criticized the Federal Reserve for delivering several interest rate cuts.\nThe main catalyst for the GPP/USD pair this week will be the Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision, which will come out on Thursday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged and maintain a more hawkish tone as inflation has remained at an elevated level in the past few months. The most recent data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 3.4% in December, higher than the bank's target of 2.0%.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will publish the latest non-farm payrolls (NFP) data, which will come out on Friday. Economists expect the data to show that the economy created 70k jobs in January after adding 50k jobs.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis\nThe GBP/USD exchange rate pulled back from the year-to-date high of 1.3876 to 1.3688, its lowest level on January 27. It moved below the key support level at 1.3727, its highest on September 17 last year.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) have pulled back in the past few days. It has moved below the Major S&R Pivot point at 1.3670.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue falling, potentially to the bottom of the trading range at 1.3550. A move above the resistance level at 1.3875 will invalidate the bearish outlook.\nReady to trade our free trading signals? We\u2019ve made a list of the best UK forex brokers worth using."

                "body": "GBP/USD softens below 1.3700 as Trump picks Warsh for Fed\n- GBP/USD softens to near 1.3670 in Monday\u2019s early European session.\n- Easing concerns over the Fed\u2019s independence and hotter PPI inflation underpin the US Dollar.\n- The Bank of England is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.75%\nThe GBP/USD pair loses ground to around 1.3670 during the early European session on Monday, pressured by renewed US Dollar demand. Signs of political stability in the United States (US) provide some support to the Greenback against the Pound Sterling (GBP). Traders will take more cues from the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data later on Monday.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Friday that Kevin Warsh, who prefers a smaller central bank balance sheet, would be his pick for the next Fed chair. Markets anticipate that Warsh may lean toward a smaller Fed balance sheet and hold the interest rate higher for longer, which provides some support to the USD and creates a headwind for the major pair.\nHotter-than-expected US producer price inflation might contribute to the US Dollar\u2019s upside, as it could further strengthen the case for the Fed to hold rates steady. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed on Friday that the US Producer Price Index (PPI) climbed 3.0% YoY in December, beating the forecast of 2.7%. On a monthly basis, the PPI rose 0.5% MoM in December, above the market consensus and the previous reading of 0.2%.\nOn the Cable front, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to cut the bank rate in December, the fourth quarter-point reduction of 2025. But most of its policymakers suggested the pace of rate cuts could slow. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to keep its benchmark rate at 3.75% on Thursday, with Governor Andrew Bailey and colleagues keeping their options open.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from"

                "body": "The US dollar began the week strong, helped by several factors. Right now, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against major currencies, stands at 97.22. The main reason for this rise is the White House\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor, to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair.\nInvestors think Warsh\u2019s appointment could lift the dollar because he has supported a strong currency in the past while at the Fed.\nSome investors expect Warsh may support cutting interest rates, especially since President Trump said the new chairman would back larger cuts. They also think he will try to reduce the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. Because of this, the dollar rose sharply after his nomination.\nLooking ahead, investors are waiting for several employment reports. The main focus is the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for January, due on Friday, which is expected to give an important clue about the Fed\u2019s next move.\nTraders are also watching the ISM Manufacturing PMI, which comes out on Monday at 15:00 GMT. Economists think manufacturing has slowed again, but only a bit. The PMI is expected to rise slightly to 48.3 from 47.9 in December.\nSince a reading below 50 means the sector is still shrinking, this report could influence how markets see future Fed policy.\nThe Dollar Index (DXY) is trading around $97.10 after bouncing from a low of $95.60, where buyers stepped in. On the 4-hour chart, the price has moved above a short-term downward trendline, which points to a corrective bounce instead of a full trend reversal. Recent bullish candles show some stability, but momentum is still weak.\nDXY is now testing resistance between $97.20 and $97.60, which matches the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the recent drop. The 50-EMA is still below the 200-EMA, so the overall trend remains bearish. The RSI has moved up from oversold levels to about 45, showing some improvement in momentum but not much strength. If DXY cannot move above $97.60, it could pull back to $96.35 or even $95.60.\nTrade idea: Consider selling near $97.60, with a target of $96.40. This idea is invalid if the price rises above $98.30.\nGBP/USD is trading around $1.3690, consolidating after a strong rally that stopped just below $1.3860. On the 4-hour chart, recent small candles show some hesitation after the sharp move up. The price is staying above the $1.3630 to $1.3650 area, which matches the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement and short-term support.\nThe pair is still above the rising trendline and the 50-EMA, which keeps the short-term outlook positive. The 200-EMA near $1.3480 supports the overall uptrend. The RSI has dropped from overbought levels and is now close to 50, which suggests momentum is cooling but not reversing.\nIf GBP/USD breaks above $1.3755, it could move toward $1.3860. If it falls below $1.3630, it may head down to $1.3580.\nTrade idea: Look to buy on dips near $1.3630, aiming for $1.3860. This idea is invalid if the price drops below $1.3570.\nEUR/USD is trading around $1.1850, consolidating after a sharp rally that peaked just below $1.2050. On the 4-hour chart, recent candles have small bodies and long wicks, showing indecision after the pullback. The price is right on a rising trendline and close to the 50-EMA, which lines up with short-term support between $1.1840 and $1.1820.\nThe overall outlook stays positive since the pair is well above the 200-EMA near $1.1750. The RSI has dropped from overbought levels and is now around 45, which means momentum has slowed but there is not much selling pressure. If the price bounces from this area, it could move back up to $1.1980. If it falls below $1.1820, it could drop further to $1.1770.\nTrade idea: Consider buying if the price holds above $1.1820, with a target of $1.1980.

However, with several AUD crosses at or near resistance \u2014 or already retracing \u2014 it suggests any hawkish surprise from this week\u2019s RBA meeting may already be priced in.\nSource: LSEG\n- AUD/USD snapped a nine-day winning streak on Friday, its strongest daily run in nine years\n- AUD/CAD printed a weekly shooting star at the 2023 high, warning of potential trend exhaustion\n- AUD/JPY formed an inside week and spinning-top doji, signalling hesitancy to break above the 2024 high near the 110 handle\n- AUD/NZD retraced for a third consecutive week, though price action still looks corrective rather than a trend reversal\n- EUR/AUD suffered its worst monthly decline in 3.5 years as the Aussie rose against the euro for a sixth straight week\n- GBP/AUD fell to a 13-month low and closed decisively below 2.00\nAustralia This Week: Economic Data and Events for AUD/USD Traders\nRBA Policy Outlook: Big Four Banks Brace for a Rate Hike\nOver the past couple of weeks, Australia\u2019s jobs report has beaten expectations while quarterly inflation landed broadly in line with consensus \u2014 the issue being that those estimates were already pitched at a higher inflation outcome. As a result, trimmed mean CPI rose to 3.3% y/y, remaining above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s 2\u20133% target band. That contrasts with the RBA\u2019s November forecast, which pencilled in a moderation to 2.7% y/y by Q4.\nStill, market reaction suggests positioning had leaned toward an even hotter inflation print, with the three-year yield falling 11bp following the release. Even so, economist forecasts and market pricing currently favour a 25bp hike on Tuesday, which would lift the cash rate to 3.85%.\nRBA cash rate futures implied a 67% probability of a 25bp hike on Friday, and all Big Four banks have now updated their forecasts to expect tightening. While ANZ view a single 25bp move this week as \u201cinsurance\u201d rather than the start of a sustained hiking cycle, NAB also expects a second 25bp hike in May, which would take the cash rate to 4.10%.\nI may be left with egg on my face by Tuesday\u2019s close, but my base case is that the RBA holds rates at 3.6% while delivering a clearly hawkish undertone. Even if the RBA does hike this week, it is difficult to see sufficient appetite for another move in May unless inflation re-accelerates in the late-April CPI report.\nTake note that the RBA will also release its Monetary Policy Statement, including updated economic and inflation forecasts.\nISM, NFP and FOMC Speakers on Standby\nThe key risk from this week\u2019s ISM and NFP reports is that they fail to soften enough to revive rate-cut discussions. That leaves markets exposed to upside surprises \u2014 and the potential for less-dovish commentary from FOMC members.\nThat risk is amplified by Friday\u2019s rebound in the US dollar following confirmation that President Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. The dollar sell-off has now lost an important dovish narrative. Markets had assumed Trump would opt for a more rate-cut-friendly replacement, but Warsh has previously argued that the Fed was too loose during Covid.\nIf US data shows renewed resilience, Warsh could ultimately prove more inclined to keep rates higher for longer than Powell. That leaves the US dollar vulnerable to a broader rebound \u2014 a dynamic that could weigh on AUD/USD over the near term.\nAUD/USD Futures Positioning | COT Report\nLarge speculators flipped to net-long exposure for the first time since December 2024.

Trimmed mean CPI is running at 3.3% year-on-year, still above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band and well above its November forecast of 2.7% by Q4. Markets currently price a 70-75% probability of a 25-bps rate hike at this week\u2019s RBA meeting, which would lift the cash rate to 3.85%.\nAll major banks now expect tightening, although views differ on whether this marks a one-off move or the start of a short extension to the cycle.\nHowever, market reaction to recent inflation data was telling. Australian three-year yields fell sharply after the CPI release, suggesting investors were positioned for an even hotter print. That raises the risk that a hike, if delivered, is treated as \u201cone and done.\u201d A surprise hold, even with hawkish guidance, would likely pressure AUD/USD in the short run.\nOn the other hand, the US dollar has rebounded following Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, a move markets interpret as less dovish than expected. This lowers expectations for short-term US rate cuts, in line with solid US PPI data and the Fed\u2019s cautious rhetoric. Asymmetric risk persists ahead of the ISM and NFP data.

With real rates still deeply negative, members agreed that further rate hikes would be appropriate if the outlook for growth and inflation holds, while maintaining a gradual tightening path.\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated over the weekend that a weak Japanese Yen (JPY) could present significant opportunities for export-oriented industries and help cushion the automobile sector against the impact of US tariffs.\nThe pair could further gain ground as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground after President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair.

Core PPI, excluding food and energy, accelerated to 3.3% YoY from 3.0%, defying forecasts for a decline to 2.9% and highlighting persistent upstream price pressures.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said additional rate cuts are not warranted at this stage, characterizing the current 3.50%\u20133.75% policy rate range as broadly neutral. Similarly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic urged patience, arguing that monetary policy should remain modestly restrictive.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar Faruqui is a Forex Analyst based in New Delhi, I"

                "body": "USD/JPY took the spotlight in early trading on Monday, February 2. The Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions fueled speculation about a near-term rate hike, influencing yen demand.\nLast week, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upward revisions to quarterly GDP and inflation forecasts, and a hawkish Governor Kazuo Ueda, sent the USD/JPY pair to 152.092. It was the pair\u2019s lowest level since October.\nThe BoJ\u2019s policy stance and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026 continue to support a bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn February 2, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions from the January 2026 meeting indicated a more hawkish stance among policymakers, aligning with expectations of an H1 2026 rate hike.\nThere was a growing sense that the need for another interest hike was approaching. Policymakers cited concerns about inflationary pressures and yen depreciation. However, there were some calls to continue assessing the effects of current inflation levels on the economy and prices.\nUSD/JPY reacted to the Summary of Opinions, initially climbing to a high of 155.240 before falling to a low of 154.821. The pullback reflected rising bets on a rate hike before the summer.\nWhile the opinions were skewed toward the hawks, not all policymakers were aligned.\nIncoming Japanese economic indicators will be crucial to the short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY, given the BoJ\u2019s quarterly outlook report. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reaffirmed the Bank\u2019s commitment to continue raising interest rates if the economy and prices aligned with its projections.\nLast week, softer Tokyo inflation and weak retail sales figures cooled bets on an April BoJ rate hike, sending USD/JPY toward 155. The price action underscored the USD/JPY pair\u2019s sensitivity to incoming economic data and shifts in central banks\u2019 policy stances.\nLater on Monday, US economic indicators will fuel speculation about an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and demand for the US dollar.\nEconomists expect the ISM Manufacturing PMI to increase from 47.9 in December to 48.3 in January. A less marked contraction across the manufacturing sector would ease concerns about a sharp slowdown in US GDP growth, bolstering the US Dollar. However, traders should consider price and employment trends, considering the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\nSofter prices and falling employment would likely overshadow a pickup in sector activity, and raise expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed policy stance would weaken the US dollar and send USD/JPY lower. Importantly, a more dovish Fed would support the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBeyond the economic data, traders should closely monitor Fed speeches for insights into inflation, the economy, and the timeline for rate cuts.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut fell from 15.4% on January 23 to 13.4% on January 30, following a larger-than-expected rise in US producer prices. Meanwhile, the chances of a June cut rose from 60.7% to 61.8% last week. The modest increase in bets on a June cut underscored optimism that inflation will cool, enabling the Fed to lower rates.\nImportantly, an H1 2026 Fed cut would support expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2026. Multiple Fed rate cuts would coincide with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy outlook, signaling narrower US-Japan rate differentials. Narrowing rate differentials, favoring the yen, would weigh on USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should assess technicals and monitor economic data, central bank chatter, and geopolitical headlines.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), but above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signaled a near-term bearish trend reversal, aligning with the negative price outlook for USD/JPY. Notably, positive yen fundamentals have aligned with the near-term technicals.\nA break bel"

                "body": "In This Article\nUSD/JPY trades below 155 as of writing, extending last week\u2019s drop and marking a shift in short- to medium-term market dynamics. The pair dropped after failing to sustain momentum above levels that had anchored price action for months. The move followed a volatile and bearish January that saw USD/JPY swing between a low of 152.09 and a peak around 159.45.\nWhile price found support near long-term averages, momentum weakened, and traders began reassessing the durability of the yen-funded carry trade. Is the market preparing for a deeper reset?\nHawkish BoJ Signals Reshape Expectations\nYen demand strengthened as investors reacted to signs that the Bank of Japan may continue tightening policy. Preliminary PMI data pointed to improving momentum in manufacturing and services, supporting a firmer economic outlook. GDP upgrades reinforced expectations that inflation and growth may align with the BoJ\u2019s projections.\nThese developments raised bets on further rate hikes in 2026, narrowing the gap between Japanese and US yields. As rate spreads compressed, the appeal of holding leveraged dollar-long positions weakened. The Bank of Japan's latest policy meeting on January 23, 2026, kept rates unchanged at 0.75%, with a dissenting vote for a hike, as policymakers viewed risks to the economic & price outlook as broadly balanced ahead of February's snap election.\nSource: MacroEdge Data Stream via X\nSummary of Opinions Takes Center Stage\nThe BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions, scheduled on February 2, has become a focal point for markets as traders looked for clarity on wage growth, tariff risks, and price stability. The Summary of Opinions from the January policy meeting pointed to a clearer sense of urgency around raising interest rates as policymakers track the inflationary impact of a weak yen.\nReferences to \u201ca weak yen\u201d and \u201cforeign exchange\u201d doubled from the prior meeting, signaling that currency depreciation now sits at the center of policy discussions. One board member said the bank should move to a rate hike without missing the right timing, citing rising prices as an urgent priority.\nThe summary suggested growing support for tightening at a faster pace than the market\u2019s expectation of roughly one hike every six months, reinforcing the view that yen weakness strengthens the case for earlier and more frequent policy action.\nElection Uncertainty Adds Political Noise\nJapan\u2019s snap election on February 8th adds another layer of uncertainty. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi seeks a stronger mandate to pursue fiscal spending plans. Earlier concerns over rising debt and issuance contributed to yen weakness during USD/JPY\u2019s surge from October to January.\nA decisive election outcome could revive those fears. However, markets also recognize that fiscal expansion may pressure the BoJ to normalize policy faster, which could support the yen. This tension keeps volatility elevated and discourages one-directional trades.\nU.S. Data and Fed Signals Guide the Dollar Side\nOn the US side, economic data and Federal Reserve communication continue to steer dollar demand. The ISM Services PMI and the February jobs report will shape expectations for rate cuts. Forecasts point to moderating service sector growth and slower wage gains.\nSuch trends could cool inflation pressures and support a dovish shift later in 2026. FedWatch data already show declining odds of an early rate cut, yet markets still expect easing later in the year. This gradual repricing limits upside for the dollar against the yen.\nOutlook: Volatility Remains High\nUSD/JPY now trades in a more fragile environment as policy signals, political risk, and yield dynamics intersect. Levels near 155 have shifted from support to resistance, while areas below 152 and toward 150 draw attention. Yen intervention rhetoric continues to cap sharp upside moves, even as occasional rebounds emerge.\nWith multiple catalysts ahead, traders brace for continued volatility.

The pair remains stronger as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid declining Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status of the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price falls over 5% after four days of losses, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices edge lower as traders keep a close watch on the United States (US)\u2013Iran negotiations that could ease geopolitical risk premiums. Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump said the United States \u201chopefully\u201d would reach a deal with Iran, after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a US attack could trigger a wider regional conflict.\nThe USD/CAD pair may further strengthen as the US Dollar could receive support from rising cautious sentiment surrounding the Federal Reserve (Fed) policy outlook, following US President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair, which markets view as signaling a more disciplined and cautious approach to monetary easing.\nFed officials also struck a patient tone. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said further rate cuts are not warranted, describing the 3.50%\u20133.75% policy range as broadly neutral, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated that policy should remain modestly restrictive.\nThe Greenback also gained support as risk sentiment improved after the US Senate reached an agreement to advance a government funding package, thereby averting a shutdown, according to Politico.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand "

Fresh threats of US military action in Iran saw crude prices climb, lending support to the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar.\nCAD was also buoyed by the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) latest interest rate decision. The BoC left rates untouched, as expected, and sounded confident that further rate cuts were unlikely.\nMeanwhile, the Pound (GBP) was left rudderless through last week\u2019s session, with a notable lack of impactful UK economic data and few important domestic events on the calendar.\nThis left GBP to trade in a wide range, with movement primarily driven by swings in other currencies.\nAlthough Prime Minister Keir Starmer travelled to China, where London and Beijing agreed new deals, this failed to boost the Pound as analysts said the agreements would have very little impact on the UK economy.\nNear-Term GBP/CAD Forecast: BoE Decision to Buoy the Pound?\nLooking forward, the focus for GBP investors this week is firmly on the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) interest rate decision.\nWith the bank broadly expected to leave interest rates unchanged, markets will be watching for hints of the bank\u2019s monetary policy path moving forward. Any signs that the bank is cautious about further cuts considering how high UK inflation currently is could underpin the Pound.\nAs for the Canadian Dollar, Canada\u2019s latest PMI results could dent CAD in the first half of the week, with economists anticipating ongoing contractions in both the manufacturing and services sectors.\nFriday then brings Canada\u2019s latest jobs report. Although the country\u2019s unemployment rate is expected to have held steady in January, a drop in the employment change figure could undermine the \u2018Loonie\u2019."

With the largest cryptocurrency now trading around $76,800, that leaves them with a paper loss of about $13,400 per BTC.\nBeing underwater could trigger ETF redemptions, particularly by short-term traders and speculators who bought in hopes of continued gains and quick profits. These potential redemptions could add to bearish pressures in the market.\nDemand for ETFs has cratered since the Oct. 8 crash, which social media is widely blaming on Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume and open interest.\nJanuary already marked a third straight month of net outflows, the first three-month run since their inception. The 11 spot bitcoin ETFs have registered a net outflow of $6.18 billion in the period, according to data source SoSoValue.\nA deepening of the bear market could potentially spur a full-scale capitulation: Long-term holders give up, liquidate, and volumes explode. This dynamic often marks peak bear phases.\nThat said, analysts have previously told CoinDesk that institutional capital flowing into ETFs is meant for the long haul, and is \"sticky\", meaning a full-blown capitulation is unlikely."

That's a blistering gain of almost 50% based on today's prices. Here's a closer look at the two powerful catalysts leading the way.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nIt's impossible to overstate how important regulatory clarity is for the crypto market. It's what leads to faster institutional adoption of crypto, and it's what leads to greater transaction activity on popular blockchain networks. In other words, if market participants know the rules of the road (even if they don't agree with them), it's a huge positive for the crypto market.\nThat's why I'm keeping my eye on one key piece of crypto legislation that is likely going to be signed into law this summer: the aptly named Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity Act). This new piece of legislation attempts to establish a clear regulatory framework for the crypto market. It will close existing loopholes, outline the roles of different regulators, define key concepts, and specify how digital assets can be traded.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIf there's one cryptocurrency that's poised to benefit the most from this new crypto legislation, it's Ethereum. As a Layer 1 blockchain network, it's exposed to every nook and cranny of the blockchain world. And it plays an especially important role in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is one of the key areas affected by the Clarity Act.\nIn theory, passage of the Clarity Act should open the floodgates for more activity on the Ethereum blockchain. And it should make it much easier for financial institutions and big institutional investors to get involved in the crypto market.\nOverall, this new regulatory framework should be very bullish for Ethereum. I expect it to get the same type of lift that it did last summer, when Congress passed the Genius Act for stablecoins. That kicked off a remarkable summer rally for Ethereum that ended with it hitting a new all-time high of $4,954 in August.\nEthereum is also at the forefront of an important new trend in the financial world known as real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. That's a mouthful, but it simply refers to transforming traditional financial assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be managed and traded on a blockchain.\nRight now, Ethereum is the clear leader when it comes to asset tokenization. No other blockchain comes close. So when big Wall Street institutions look to tokenize assets, they turn to Ethereum first. Case in point: when BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) launched its first-ever tokenized fund back in 2024, it chose Ethereum.\nAsset tokenization could be a boon for Ethereum. According to top consulting firms, it could be a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity by 2030. If Ethereum maintains its dominant role in DeFi, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which it does not benefit from the meteoric rise of asset tokenization.\nAccording to Wall Street strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, asset tokenization is the type of once-in-a-lifetime event that can forever change the global financial system. He compares it to the U.S. decision back in 1971 to go off the gold standard. That's how big a seismic shift asset tokenization could be. In fact, says Lee, it could lead to Ethereum skyrocketing "

                "body": "Institutional cryptocurrency maneuvers often unfold behind closed doors, but a recent report has cast a stark light on one firm\u2019s massive, high-stakes position. According to data from AmberCN, Trend Research, a subsidiary of the prominent LD Capital, currently holds approximately 618,000 Ethereum (ETH) valued at a staggering $1.43 billion. Crucially, the firm\u2019s average purchase price sits at $3,180, while its liquidation price\u2014the point at which its leveraged holdings could be forcibly sold\u2014hovers around $1,830. This revelation provides a rare, transparent window into the complex interplay of accumulation, leverage, and risk management at the highest levels of digital asset investment. The firm\u2019s recent strategic sale of 33,589 ETH, resulting in a $27.71 million realized loss to repay loans and lower this liquidation threshold, underscores the intense pressures within today\u2019s crypto lending landscape.\nDecoding Trend Research\u2019s Ethereum Liquidation Price\nUnderstanding the mechanics behind a liquidation price is fundamental to grasping this situation\u2019s gravity. In decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending, investors often use their existing cryptocurrency as collateral to secure loans. These loans can then fund further purchases, a strategy known as leverage. However, protocols like Aave, which Trend Research utilizes, require the loan\u2019s value to remain below a specific percentage of the collateral\u2019s value\u2014the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. If the collateral\u2019s market price falls precipitously, threatening this ratio, the protocol automatically sells, or liquidates, the collateral to repay the loan and protect lenders. This trigger point is the liquidation price.\nFor Trend Research, the $1,830 figure represents this critical line. A sustained drop in Ethereum\u2019s price below this level could force the automatic sale of hundreds of thousands of ETH, potentially exacerbating market downturns. The firm\u2019s reported $941 million in outstanding loans against this collateral creates a highly leveraged position. Consequently, managing this liquidation risk becomes a paramount concern, directly leading to the firm\u2019s recent decisive actions.\nThe Anatomy of a Strategic Withdrawal\nTrend Research\u2019s move to sell 33,589 ETH for $79.12 million was not a panicked exit but a calculated risk mitigation strategy. By using the proceeds to repay a portion of its loans, the firm effectively increases the equity cushion in its position. This action lowers the overall Loan-to-Value ratio, which in turn pushes the liquidation price further down from the market price. Essentially, the firm sacrificed $27.71 million in realized capital to buy itself more breathing room and avoid a potentially catastrophic, protocol-enforced liquidation event. This trade-off highlights a core tenet of professional portfolio management: sometimes, realizing a controlled loss is preferable to risking a total wipeout.\nThe Broader Context of Crypto Lending Protocols\nTrend Research\u2019s situation cannot be viewed in isolation. It is a prominent case study within the evolving ecosystem of crypto lending and decentralized finance. Protocols like Aave have revolutionized access to capital within the blockchain space, enabling sophisticated financial strategies previously confined to traditional markets. However, they also introduce new systemic risks. The potential for cascading liquidations\u2014where one large liquidation triggers further price drops and more liquidations\u2014remains a key concern for market stability.\nFurthermore, the firm\u2019s ongoing accumulation since November of last year signals a strong, long-term conviction in Ethereum\u2019s fundamental thesis, despite short-term market volatility. This behavior is consistent with institutional \u201cdollar-cost averaging\u201d strategies, where investors build positions over time to smooth out entry prices. Nevertheless, the addition of high leverage to this strategy dramatically amplifies both potential returns and risks, creating the delicate balanc"

The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal is worth $500 million.\nThe Abu Dhabi investment firm paid the first $250 million installment. Of that, $187 million went directly to Trump-linked entities.\nWLFI Deal Details and Board Changes\nThe agreement was signed on January 16, 2025, just days before Trump\u2019s inauguration. Tahnoon secured two board seats as part of the deal. At the same time, the Trump family\u2019s ownership dropped from 75% to 38%.\nTahnoon also aims to gain access to U.S. AI technology through this investment. Analysts note that the deal makes the U.S.-UAE ties stronger in AI and crypto.\nPotential Constitutional Concerns\nLegal experts raised concerns about the emoluments clause. This rule prevents foreign influence on a president\u2019s family business. Although Trump was no longer in office when the deal closed, the timing and size of the investment drew attention.\nThe deal also highlights how international investments interact with emerging financial technologies like DeFi. Investors, regulators and policymakers now face new challenges in monitoring cross-border ownership.\nBroader Implications for DeFi and Crypto\nWLFI launched in 2024 and quickly attracted high-profile investors. The platform also connects to larger UAE crypto investments. For example, the UAE reportedly invested $2 billion in Binance using WLFI\u2019s stablecoin.\nAnalysts believe Tahnoon\u2019s investment could increase WLFI\u2019s growth. At the same time, it may increase scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The deal demonstrates how private equity, government-linked investors, and emerging technologies intersect globally.\nWhat Comes Next for WLFI\nThe Abu Dhabi\u2013WLFI investment deal shows the growing international interest in U.S.-linked DeFi platforms. Observers will closely watch U.S. authorities\u2019 response to large foreign stakes in sensitive financial projects.\nThe outcome may set precedents for future cross-border investments in crypto and AI.

The recovery comes as Jupiter announced it will bring Polymarket to Solana for the first time, alongside a $35 million strategic investment from ParaFi Capital that signals institutional confidence in the ecosystem.\nJupiter announced a landmark integration that will bring Polymarket, the largest prediction market in crypto, to Solana for the first time. The deal positions Jupiter as a comprehensive on-chain predictions hub alongside its existing swap functionality.\nThe announcement came with a $35 million strategic investment in JUP from ParaFi Capital, settled entirely in JupUSD with an extended token lockup. Jupiter\u2019s pseudonymous co-founder meow said prediction markets will be a major focus over the next year, with planned work spanning APIs and revamped market discovery tools.\nJupiter\u2019s on-chain footprint supports the expansion. Total value locked sits at $2.35 billion with annualized fees near $650 million and protocol revenue around $150 million. The Polymarket integration could drive additional users and liquidity to Solana as prediction markets continue gaining traction.\nCoinglass data shows $39.20 million in spot outflows on February 2, continuing the distribution pattern that has defined the past several weeks. The selling pressure suggests that holders are using any bounce to reduce exposure rather than accumulating at lower levels.\nThe divergence between positive fundamental developments and negative spot flows highlights the broader risk-off environment affecting all altcoins. When ecosystem catalysts fail to attract fresh buying, it signals that macro sentiment remains the dominant driver of price action.\nOn the daily chart, Solana has broken below the descending trendline support that held since November, accelerating into a key horizontal support zone near $100. Price trades well below all four major EMAs, with the 20 day at $121.45, the 50 day at $129.53, the 100 day at $141.08, and the 200 day at $154.21.\nRelated: Hyperliquid Price Prediction: Can HYPE Reclaim $32.00 or Is Deeper Consolidation Ahead?\nThe Supertrend indicator remains bearish at $123.04, confirming the downtrend that began from the September highs near $260. The current price represents a 60 percent decline from those peaks.\nThe $95 to $100 zone represents critical support that held during the November correction. A break below this level would expose the $85 demand zone from July 2025, where SOL found buyers during the summer consolidation.\nOn the 2 hour chart, Solana trades within a descending channel that has guided price action since January 30. The channel resistance sits near $105, while support runs through the $95 zone.\nRSI has recovered to 40.04 from oversold levels near 30.15, suggesting the immediate selling pressure has eased. MACD shows the histogram turning positive at 0.32, with the signal lines beginning to converge, indicating momentum may be shifting.\nThe bounce from $95.83 has produced higher lows on the intraday timeframe, but price remains within the descending channel structure. Bulls need a break above channel resistance at $105 to signal any meaningful reversal attempt.\nThe trend remains bearish while price trades below the EMA cluster, but the $95 to $100 support zone offers a potential base for stabilization.\n- Bullish case: A daily close above $121.45 would reclaim the 20 day EMA and signal that the $95 low marked a local bottom. The Jupiter catalyst could attract buyers if broader crypto sentiment improves.\n- Bearish case: A close below $95 would break the 2025 support structure and expose the $85 demand zone. With spot outflows persisting and macro headwinds intact, that scenario remains probable."

The collaboration aims to make event-based trading more accessible to Solana users by streamlining the experience.\nEvent-Driven Trading Sees Continued Growth\nPolymarket has become one of the largest prediction market platforms in the crypto space. It lets users trade on outcomes of real-world events, including politics, economics, sports, and culture.\nIn January 2026, Polymarket recorded a trading volume of $7.66 billion. This was an increase from $5.31 billion in December 2025, according to The Block\u2019s data. Its competitor, Kalshi, also saw rising volumes, reaching $9.16 billion in January compared to $6.58 billion in the previous month.\nThe rise in volumes shows increasing user interest in event-driven contracts, especially around major global developments and sporting events.\nJupiter Positions Itself as a Solana-Based Prediction Hub\nBy integrating Polymarket directly, Jupiter has expanded its functionality beyond its original use as a trading aggregator. This new feature could position it as a central hub for prediction markets on the Solana network.\nThe prediction feature enables users to explore various contracts, track live outcomes, and place trades \u2014 all within the Jupiter interface. This offers convenience to users familiar with DeFi platforms but looking to engage in new market types.\nJupiter\u2019s large user base and infrastructure on Solana may help Polymarket reach more traders and increase market activity in the Solana ecosystem.\nBroader Expansion of Prediction Markets in Crypto and TradFi\nThe integration is part of a wider trend of prediction markets gaining popularity. These platforms are moving beyond niche crypto communities and are entering more traditional trading environments.\nIn January 2026, Coinbase rolled out access to Kalshi-powered prediction contracts across all 50 U.S. states. This marked a step toward regulated access to event contracts in the traditional financial system.\nAdditionally, Polymarket recently signed a multi-year sports data deal with Major League Soccer. This gives it access to official league data, which can be used to create licensed prediction contracts around games and player outcomes.\nThis growing interest from major exchanges and sports leagues may help normalize prediction markets and encourage further institutional participation."

                "body": "Solana Price Prediction: $30M Hack Sends SOL Below $100 \u2013 Can Bulls Recover?\nShare:\nSolana (SOL) is trading around $97 after a sharp sell-off that pushed the token below the key $100 mark. The recent decline comes after a tough stretch for the crypto market overall, but Solana has dropped more than most due to new security concerns affecting investor confidence.\nSOL has dropped from the $140\u2013$145 range in just a few weeks, wiping out much of its recovery from late 2025. For newer investors, this kind of decline usually comes from fear, forced selling, and uncertainty, not a sudden failure in the technology itself.\nStep Finance Hack Exposes $30M SOL Vulnerability, Raises Security Concerns in Solana DeFi\nA major reason for the recent drop was a security breach at Step Finance, where about $30 million in SOL was taken from treasury wallets. Around 261,854 SOL was moved quickly, leading to worries that someone with internal access, not just an automated hack, was involved.\nStep Finance has said that user funds were safe, but the incident still shook the Solana DeFi community. Big treasury wallets are increasingly becoming targets, and this event shows why stronger protections, such as multi-signature approvals and stricter access controls, are needed.\nFor the market, the news itself was more important than the details. When stress is high, security scares often speed up selling as traders rush to cut their risk.\nJupiter\u2019s New Explorer Offers a Long-Term Positive\nThere are also some positive updates. Jupiter has launched explore.ag, a new tool for the Solana ecosystem that brings together data from Solscan and DeFiLlama in one place. This tool helps users track projects, transactions, and DeFi stats more easily, making the network more transparent.\nFor newcomers, this might not change prices right away, but it shows that Solana\u2019s ecosystem is still growing. Improved data and analytics often bring in developers and long-term investors, even when the market is down.\nSolana Technical Analysis: Can SOL Reclaim $100?\nLooking at the charts, Solana is clearly in a short-term downtrend. The price is still moving within a downward channel that started in late 2025. When the price fell below the 100-day and 200-day EMAs near $140, it quickly dropped through $119 and $111, which points to forced selling instead of regular profit-taking.\nKey levels to watch now:\n- Resistance: $105\u2013$111, where previous support has turned into a selling zone\n- Support: $90\u2013$81, aligned with prior demand and Fibonacci extensions\n- Deeper risk: A move toward $70 if broader market weakness intensifies\nThe RSI is now in the mid-20s, which means the market is oversold. This can sometimes cause a short-term bounce, but it does not promise a quick turnaround.\nFor a more positive outlook, SOL needs to hold above $100, set a higher low, and close above $111 on the daily chart. This could lead to a recovery toward $120\u2013$130 later on.\nFor now, Solana seems to be in a tough but common reset phase, which often comes before stronger and more lasting gains once the selling slows down.\nBitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.\nAudited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $31.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013665 before the next increase.\nAs Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto\u2019s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.\nClick Here to Participate in the PresaleThe post Solana Price Prediction: $30M "

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The Dow Jones is moving in a tense, choppy zone where every headline feels like a catalyst. Instead of a clean breakout or a brutal crash, we are seeing a cautious tug-of-war: rotation into solid blue chips, tactical profit-taking in recent winners, and short-lived rallies that quickly meet selling pressure. Think of it as a late-cycle, high-alert environment: not panic, not euphoria, but edgy optimism with a built-in exit plan.\nThe market tone is defined by sharp intraday swings, fast reversals after the opening bell, and a constant back-and-forth between \"soft landing\" believers and \"recession is just delayed\" skeptics. Bulls are still very much alive, but they are being forced to work harder for every inch of upside.\nThe Story: What is driving this Dow Jones mood right now? It is all about three big pillars: the Federal Reserve, inflation expectations, and corporate earnings.\n1. The Fed and bond yields: the macro puppet masters\nJerome Powell and the Fed are the main characters in this script. After a long cycle of aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation, markets had been dreaming of swift, repeated rate cuts. Reality check: recent Fed messaging has been more cautious. \"Higher for longer\" is not dead, it is just being rebranded into \"data dependent.\" That subtle language shift is everything for the Dow.\nBond yields tell the story under the surface. When longer-term Treasury yields edge higher, you can see pressure on rate-sensitive sectors: industrials, real estate, and some financials. When yields ease lower, suddenly the \"risk-on\" crowd shows up again, and the dip-buyers rush into blue chips. The Dow, being packed with established multinationals, reacts more to growth expectations and funding costs than the ultra-speculative tech plays on the Nasdaq.\nThis week, markets are recalibrating: the Fed is not in full-on easing mode yet, but it is no longer trying to break the economy. That keeps the door open for a soft landing narrative: slowing, but not crashing.\n2. Inflation, consumers, and the real economy vibe\nOn the data front, traders are glued to every CPI, PPI, and jobs release. Inflation has cooled from the peak, but it is not comfortably back in the sweet spot. That is why each report sparks a reaction: a slightly hotter inflation read can trigger a sharp, nervous sell-off; a softer one can unleash a relief rally.\nConsumer spending remains the joker in the deck. The US consumer has been surprisingly resilient, still spending on travel, dining, and experiences, even as credit card balances rise and savings shrink. For the Dow, that matters a lot. Think: global brands, industrial giants, consumer-facing blue chips. As long as the consumer does not roll over, earnings for those Dow components can hold up better than the doom-and-gloom crowd expects.\nBut under the surface, you can feel a shift: more mentions of \"downtrading\" in earnings calls, hints of slower order books in cyclical sectors, and talk of cautious guidance. Markets are trying to sniff out whether this is just normalization after a wild post-pandemic run or the early phase of a demand slowdown.\n3. Earnings season: blue chips under the microscope\nEarnings season is the scoreboard, and for the Dow, it is pure x-ray vision into the real economy. Industrial leaders are talking about mixed demand: some strength in areas tied to infrastructure and AI-related capex, but more hesitancy in cyclical consumer and manufacturing demand. Financial names are navigating a tricky rate landscape, balancing net interest income with concerns about credit quality if growth slo"

                "body": "Top news catalysts for FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 Indices this week\nThe FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 Indices remained in a tight range on Monday as market participants waited for major macro events and earnings from British companies. This article explores some of the top catalysts to watch this week.\nFTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices to react to Bank of England interest rate decision\nOne of the main catalysts for the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices will be the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision, which will happen on Thursday this week.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.75% as officials remain concerned about the elevated inflation.\nThe most recent results showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.8% in December, higher than the bank\u2019s target of 2.0%. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, has also remained at an elevated level in the past few months.\nStill, most officials, including Andrew Bailey, the bank\u2019s governor, believe that inflation will continue falling in the coming months.\nThe BoE outlook explains why UK bond yields have remained unchanged in the past few months. Data shows that the ten-year bond yield has remained unchanged at 4.50%, while the five-year was at 4.6%.\nTop UK companies to publish earnings\nThe other key catalyst for the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices are the upcoming earnings from some of the biggest companies in the UK.\nGSK, a major pharmaceutical valued at over $103 billion, will release its results on Wednesday.\nShell, the biggest energy company in Europe, will release it on Thursday. These numbers come as the energy market continued doing well because of the rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran.\nUnilever, a major player in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Industry (FCMG), will release its numbers on Thursday.\nMore companies like Entain, Watches of Switzerland BT Group, Compass Group, and Vodafone will also publish their numbers.\nOn top of this, hundreds of American companies, including popular names like Amazon and Google, will publish their financial results. Historically, these companies often have an impact on the global financial market.\nCommodity prices to impact UK stocks\nThe other major catalyst for the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices is the performance of key commodities. Gold, copper, and silver prices tumbled on Monday, affecting key companies in the industry.\nIndeed, data shows that the Fresnillo stock price crashed by 7% as silver plunged. Fresnillo is one of the biggest silver miners globally. It has been one of the best-performing companies in FTSE 100 Index in the past few months as silver jumped.\nEndeavour Mining\u2019s stock price dropped by 6.8% as gold prices dropped. Other mining companies like Antofagasta, Anglo American, Rio Tinto,and Glencore were among the top laggards in the FTSE 100 Index on Monday.\nGeopolitical events to impact British stocks\nThe FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices will also react to the upcoming geopolitical developments in the Middle East.\nDonald Trump has warned that he may attack Iran as soon as his armada near the region. Trump has accused the Iranian regime of killing protestors and for having nuclear ambitions. Also, Trump wants Iran to dismantle its civilian nuclear ambitions and limit its ballistic missile program.\nAn attack would have major implications in the US and UK equities as it would lead to higher oil prices and inflation. It would also disrupt the travel activity in the region, affecting companies like IAG and EasyJet."

Data released recently showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 3.4% in December last year.\nWhile officials believe that prices will drop to 2.0% soon, officials at the Bank of England are divided on when this will happen. However, the recent crude oil price surge after Trump announced a potential attack on Iran, could push inflation higher in the near term.\nMore data showed that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.1% in the three-months through November last year. Wage growth is expected to undershoot the bank\u2019s forecast for the fourth quarter.\nMeanwhile, the central bank expects that the British economy will continue slowing in the coming months because of Rachel Reeves\u2019 tax increases. The view is that the economy grew by 1.2% this year.\nUS non-farm payrolls jobs numbers\nThe next key catalyst for the GBP/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming US non-farm payrolls data, which will come out later this week.\nData compiled by TradingEconomics shows that the economy created 70k jobs in January, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.4%.\nThe data comes a day a week after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged between 3.50% and 3.75%. Officials also upgraded the economic outlook, pointing to lower inflation in the coming weeks.\nThe GBP/USD pair will also react to the nomination of Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chairman. Warsh is widely seen as a highly hawkish official who has criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates and implementing quantitative easing policies.\nMeanwhile, the pair will also react to the upcoming attack on Iran, which may happen as early as this week. Such an attack will lead to higher oil prices, which will lead to more volatility and high inflation.\nGBP/USD technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the GBP/USD exchange rate peaked at 1.3876 in January and has pulled back to the current 1.3670. It has moved to the Major S&R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool.\nThe GBP to USD pair has moved below the important support level at 1.3727, its highest level in September last year. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have continued falling.\nTherefore, the most likely GBP/USD forecast is bearish, with the next key target level being at 1.3500.

Instead of a clean trend, we are seeing choppy sessions, fast intraday reversals, and a strong focus on headlines from the European Central Bank, energy markets, and German industry. This is not a calm bull market \u2013 this is a battlefield where every bounce is tested and every dip gets scanned for hidden opportunity.\nVolatility is not extreme, but the tone is nervous. German blue chips are hovering around important zones where long-term investors and short-term traders are fighting for control. Momentum is fragile: one strong macro surprise or central bank comment could flip the script from cautious optimism to aggressive risk-off \u2013 or ignite a powerful squeeze that forces the bears to cover.\nThe Story: To understand the DAX 40 right now, you need to zoom out and connect four big narratives: the ECB, the German economy, the global growth story, and the euro.\n1. ECB and interest rate drama\nThe European Central Bank is the main puppet master for European equities. After a brutal rate-hiking cycle to crush inflation, the market is now obsessed with one thing: the timing and pace of rate cuts. The narrative swinging around is simple: if inflation keeps grinding lower and growth stays weak, the pressure on the ECB to ease will increase. That is DAX-positive because cheaper money supports valuations, especially for cyclical and rate-sensitive sectors like autos, industrials, and real estate.\nBut there is a catch. The ECB cannot move too fast if wage growth and services inflation stay sticky. Every hawkish comment from policymakers revives fears of \u201chigher for longer\u201d and hits growth-sensitive names. Traders are now hyperfocused on every ECB press conference, every speech, and every inflation print. This creates a stop-and-go market: short rallies on hopes of cuts, quick pullbacks when the tone turns cautious again.\n2. German industry: from crisis talk to cautious stabilization\nGermany is still dealing with the aftermath of an energy price shock, weak global manufacturing, and a structural transition away from cheap Russian gas and old-school combustion engines. Recent data has been mixed: manufacturing activity has shown signs of bottoming but remains fragile, while business sentiment surveys still signal uncertainty rather than clear confidence.\nThe DAX 40 is heavily exposed to global trade and manufacturing. Industrial giants, chemical companies, and machinery exporters depend on external demand from the US, China, and the rest of Europe. When Chinese data looks weak or US growth expectations are revised lower, the DAX feels it quickly. On the flip side, any hint that global manufacturing is stabilizing or that inventory cycles are turning up can light a fire under German exporters.\n3. German autos vs. the global EV and AI wave\nThe German auto complex \u2013 think big legacy car manufacturers and their suppliers \u2013 is locked in a brutal competition with Chinese EV producers and US tech-driven players. Margins are under pressure, and the market is constantly asking: can German brands reinvent themselves fast enough, or will they slowly bleed market share?\nAt the same time, another theme is quietly helping the DAX: the global AI and digitalization wave. While the DAX is not as tech-heavy as the US indices, several components are deeply involved in industrial automation, semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and software for factories and logistics. As companies worldwide invest in efficiency, r"

                "body": "Is gold\u2019s slump the start of a reversal? 3 Wall Street analysts weigh in\nInvesting.com -- U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, led by continued weakness in technology shares, even as markets appeared broadly comfortable with President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair.\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.43% to close at 6,939.03, extending its losing streak to three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 179 points, or 0.36%, finishing at 48,892.47. Losses were steeper in the NASDAQ Composite, which fell 0.94% to 23,461.82, after all three benchmarks had been down more than 1% earlier in the day.\nThat said, moves across other assets pointed to a calm reaction to the Fed nomination, with the U.S. dollar strengthening, while Treasury yields were little changed.\n\"The Warsh nomination should be viewed as a market stabilizing event with the recent parabolic rise in precious metals raising questions about the \"run it hot\" strategy,\" Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson said in a note. \"Friday\u2019s price action signals it was the right move as the S&P 500/Gold ratio had one of its best days in history.\"\nEven with Friday\u2019s pullback and choppy trading through the month, Wall Street still posted gains for January. The S&P 500 rose about 1.4%, while the Dow added roughly 1.7%. The Nasdaq also finished higher, up around 1%. Smaller stocks outperformed, with the Russell 2000 climbing more than 5% over the month.\nThis week, attention will stay centered on the fourth-quarter earnings season, while investors also look ahead to the U.S. monthly jobs report scheduled for February 6. The Fed last week pointed to signs of stabilization in the labor market as it paused its interest-rate cutting cycle.\nEconomists expect January nonfarm payrolls to rise by about 64,000, according to a Reuters poll. Economic data releases are also returning to a more normal rhythm after delays caused by last year\u2019s 43-day government shutdown.\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s latest meeting, markets are now pricing in no additional rate cuts until June, though a sharper-than-expected slowdown in hiring could quickly shift those expectations.\nMore mega-cap earnings and jobs data set to steer markets this week\nAfter a weak report from heavyweight Microsoft pressured major indexes, another wave of high-profile earnings \u2014 including results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2014 will put U.S. equities to the test in the days ahead.\nWith stocks now in the fourth year of a bull market, concerns around stretched valuations have grown, particularly among companies benefiting from enthusiasm over AI-driven growth.\nRoughly a quarter of the S&P 500 is due to report results this week, with solid U.S. profit growth continuing to underpin optimistic views for equities into 2026.\nInvestors will be watching closely for earnings and capital spending signals from Alphabet and Amazon, two key AI-focused hyperscalers.\nOther major names on the calendar include weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\nWhat analysts are saying about U.S. stocks\nMorgan Stanley: \"The sharp reversal last week in the S&P/gold ratio gives an early indication that confidence may be restored. Near-term, further upside may come from falling gold amid tighter liquidity considerations, while longer- term upside is likely driven by productivity gains on the back of a capex cycle. Consistent with this view, markets are rewarding high capex-to-sales firms and improving earnings momentum. Amid these dynamics, we see a rotation from commodity cyclicals back to consumer cyclicals in the near/intermediate term.\"\nEvercore ISI: \"For stocks, the selloff in Parabolic Gold and Silver \u2013 after frantic, meme-like trading \u2013 is not a material headwind, instead putting to rest fear of building systemic risk and turning focus back to equities. 4 year into the Bull market, stocks \u201cshould\u201d be more volatile.

Thompson's death more than 20 years after it was ruled a suicide.\nThe review was initiated in July 2025 after the late gonzo journalist\u2019s widow, Anita Thompson, raised new concerns with Sheriff Michael Buglione about the original investigation into her husband\u2019s death at Owl Farm, the couple\u2019s Woody Creek home. Thompson, 67, died on Feb. 20, 2005, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\"While we have always believed the original investigation was conducted properly, we recognized the importance of an independent review for the Thompson family,\" Buglione said in a statement. \"CBI\u2019s conclusions reaffirm the original findings and, we hope, provide reassurance and clarity.\"\nTEACHER'S 23-STAB-WOUND DEATH RULED SUICIDE AGAIN DESPITE EXPERT CLAIMS OF HOMICIDE\nAccording to CBI, the review found no new physical evidence, facts or circumstances that would support a conclusion different from the original ruling.\nThe reexamination included a review of Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office records, autopsy findings by forensic pathologist Dr. Dean Havlik, and interviews with Thompson\u2019s widow and family members, as well as original investigators, the Pitkin County coroner, and former sheriff\u2019s officials.\nInvestigators also conducted a scene examination, though much of the original physical evidence and photographs had been destroyed under retention policies.\nCBI also said that a modern trajectory analysis and scene reconstruction conducted in 2025 was consistent with the original investigation, autopsy report and witness observations.\nRory Safir, a criminal defense attorney and forensic scientist, said the decision to conduct an independent review reflected transparency rather than doubt about the original findings.\n\"They had obviously originally ruled it as a suicide and then they re-initiated this review because I believe family members raised concerns which weren\u2019t disclosed to the public,\" Safir told Fox News Digital. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that original investigation was flawed.\"\nSafir said the review appears to have followed standard forensic practice for revisiting high-profile cases decades later.\n\"They would have looked at what would have been the original reports, any of the autopsy materials,\" he said. \"I know they interviewed some of the witnesses that were still around, the original investigators as well as re-examining the scene using the evidence that was available.\"\nSafir also credited updated technology as likely central to the outcome.\n\"I would imagine a big part of their confirming their findings had to do with the bullet trajectory reconstruction and using kind of modern technology to validate the original findings,\" Safir said.\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\nCBI did not disclose what specific information from Thompson\u2019s widow prompted the review but said it did not rise to a level requiring the case to be reopened.\nSafir said that threshold is intentionally high.\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\"What they\u2019re looking for to see if they would reopen a case like this, they would need some kind of new evidence that would materially contradict or undermine what they originally found,\" he said. \"And that didn\u2019t happen here.\"\nSafir said a renewed investigation would require grounded evidence \u2013 not internet theories.\n\"As far as what\u2019s out there on the internet, I would say that just a lot of this speculation and internet theories are not evidence,\" he said. \"This is a criminal investigation. It\u2019s going to be grounded in evidence, not in, you know, internet theories.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?

                "body": "L.A.\u2019s buzziest coffee shop is in a gorgeous Angelino Heights home. Is this the start of a bigger trend?\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s 10:54 a.m. Thursday at Granada coffee shop in Angelino Heights, on one of those 73-degree winter mornings in Los Angeles when the sky glows its sunniest cobalt-blue through bare branches. An 11-person-deep line stretches just past the open door. I\u2019m sitting on an L-shaped couch with sturdy burgundy upholstery, taking in the scene while waiting for a cortado.\nThe room beams casual charm \u2014 plants, light woods, abstract prints on the wall to add color, a communal table and a toddler-size rocking chair among a couple Eames-style loungers \u2014 and couldn\u2019t hold many more people. Three women, all with babies in their arms, find seats at a second common table in the backyard garden, joining others who\u2019ve disappeared into laptop-headphones concentration mode.\nA guy with a complicated-looking video camera pans the crowd while maneuvering around the furniture. He\u2019s in media, too, and we\u2019re here for the same reason.\nWhat makes this coffee destination unique\nSydney Wayser and her husband, Isaac Watters, opened Granada in early January. They run it out of the ground-floor section of their house. Their business has become the first breakout sensation in central Los Angeles that\u2019s part of the Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation (MEHKO) program, introduced as a California Health and Safety Code statute in 2019, designed to legally permit enterprising cooks who want to make food to sell from home, or to create a micro-restaurant in their residence.\nThe state mandate left it to individual counties to approve MEHKO operations, which the L.A. County Board of Supervisors passed in May 2024. Applicants began receiving permits in November 2024, after a process that involved steps any local restaurant would go through, including food safety certification, business licensing and inspection via the L.A. County Department of Public Health.\nWatters and Wayser brainstormed the idea for Granada after Watters heard a segment on KCRW, during which L.A. journalist Meghan McCarron was discussing an article about the MEHKO initiative she had written for the New York Times.\nThe couple had in essence already constructed a possibility for such a space, and as individuals they were built for it.\nThey\u2019d designed their house, a tasteful modern cube at the top of a cul-de-sac among the 19th century Victorian and California Craftsman homes of Angelino Heights, for post-pandemic entertaining. They have a 3-year-old daughter. Something like a coffee shop, they thought, would be ideal to operate roughly during the hours she was in preschool Monday through Friday.\nA short menu came together: classic espresso drinks, cold brew, loose leaf tea and the requisite matcha latte, alongside a few pastries (seasonally shifting galettes, both sweet and savory, square biscuits with visible layers and a delicately crumbed ricotta-blood orange cake) from star L.A. baker Sasha Piligian. Ceramicist Amy Louise Johnson crafted beautiful earthen cups.\nI\u2019m guessing neither Watters nor Wayser anticipated quite the instant burst of social-media-driven popularity, but they\u2019re also both musicians. I watched them both navigate customer interactions with unflagging charisma. When a woman complimented the vase of flowers on the kitchen island that serves as an ordering counter, Wayser waved her hand breezily and said, \u201cThey\u2019re a week and a half old now and starting to wilt. I haven\u2019t had the time to change them!\u201d\nComing and going, I noticed patrons acting respectfully with regard to neighbors. No one unthinkingly parked in the long, steep driveway that serves multiple properties; the area has plenty of street parking. A fence around Granada dampens the sound. You won\u2019t know the place exists until you pass through the entrance to find a yard full of souls attending what feels like an unusually mellow house party.\nBigger MEHKO implications and possibilities\nIt is thrilling to witn"

                "body": "Shares rose as investors priced in political stability and easy fiscal policy, even as that backdrop keeps pressure on the yen and Japanese government bonds.\nabout 10 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 ticked up as the yen weakened and polls pointed to a solid win for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ahead of a Feb. 8 snap election.\nWhat does this mean?\nMarkets tend to like two things: a currency tailwind and fewer political surprises. A weaker yen boosts Japanese exporters by making overseas profits worth more when translated back home. And election optimism signals policy continuity, which investors often interpret as ongoing fiscal support for growth. The flip side is that the same easy-policy vibe can weigh on the yen and Japanese government bonds, since looser conditions can keep real yields low and stoke concerns about larg..\ner deficits.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Stocks can cheer while the yen struggles.\nIf investors expect steady leadership and supportive policy, equities \u2013 especially exporters and other yen-sensitive firms \u2013 can benefit even as the currency slides. That split matters because it can reshape sector winners and losers, and it can also keep pressure on government bonds if markets demand more compensation for fiscal expansion.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s playbook is still support growth first.\nJapan has leaned on accommodative policy for decades, and the latest election backdrop reinforces that approach. It can help sustain risk-taking at home, but it also leaves Japan more exposed if global rates stay high \u2013 a weak yen raises import costs, and bond investors may push back if deficits look set to widen.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
