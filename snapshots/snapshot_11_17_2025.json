Spot prices ticked higher, but December gold futures dipped a bit, reflecting uncertainty in the air. With the Fed already making two rate cuts this year, hopes for another have faded as policymakers express fresh concerns about sticky inflation and a resilient jobs market. This cautious outlook has taken the edge off expectations for speedy monetary easing. Meanwhile, holdings in the world\u2019s largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Trust, dropped nearly half a percent in just one day, showing nerves among investors. After last week\u2019s sharp selloff, dubbed \u201cpotentially overdone\u201d by KCM Trade analysts, bargain hunters stepped in\u2014yet a firmer US dollar and turbulence following the recent government shutdown keep volatility elevated.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Fed pulse sets the pace for gold.\nGold\u2019s value tends to rise when Fed rates trend lower, but with odds of a near-term cut now slipping, investor excitement has cooled. A stronger US dollar adds pressure, making gold less attractive internationally and weighing on ETF inflows. Even so, other precious metals have rallied alongside gold, with silver, platinum, and palladium notching up gains amid the uncertainty.\nThe bigger picture: Economic uncertainty fuels the flight to safety.\nRecent disruptions like the government shutdown and delays in key economic data releases are muddying the global outlook. Gold thrives in these choppy waters, often becoming a go-to when markets face doubt. As investors monitor the Fed\u2019s next move, these decisions will likely guide both sentiment and allocation across global assets.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

At early trade, MCX Gold December futures were trading 0.21 per cent lower at Rs 1,23,300 per 10 grams. Silver prices also slipped, with MCX Silver December contracts down 0.38 per cent at Rs 1,55,424 per kg. \"Gold has support at $4035-4000 while resistance at $4115-4140.\nSilver has support at $50.30-49.85 while resistance is at $51.25-51.50,\" market experts said. \"In INR gold has support at Rs1,22,950-1,22,380 while resistance at Rs1,24,950-1,25,500. Silver has support at Rs1,53,850-1,52,500 while resistance at Rs1,56,740, 1,57,880,\" they added. The dollar index gained 0.14 per cent, putting pressure on gold demand and prices. Since gold is priced in dollars, a stronger US currency makes the metal costlier for buyers using other currencies, which often reduces its demand.\nInvestors are now waiting for important US economic data due this week, including the September nonfarm payrolls report scheduled for Thursday. These figures will give a clearer picture of the US economy\u2019s health and help shape expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s December monetary policy decision. The recent US government shutdown had delayed the release of some economic data.\nHowever, media reports indicate that the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis is preparing to update its schedule for upcoming data releases. Gold and silver prices experienced a rollercoaster trend last week, slipping from their highs in the last two days after hawkish Fed comments dampened investor sentiment.\n\"The metals also softened as investors prepared for a busy week of delayed US economic data. The upcoming non-farm payrolls report is expected to offer crucial insight into the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy direction,\" market watchers said. \"Expectations of a December rate cut dropped to 46 per cent after hawkish Fed signals. Despite near-term volatility, both precious metals are on track for their strongest annual performance in decades,\" they added. Robust central bank buying and persistent safe-haven interest amid fiscal and geopolitical uncertainty continue to fuel bullion\u2019s upward momentum, as per the experts.\nDisclaimer: This story is from the syndicated feed.

                "body": "Oil prices fell on Monday, erasing the previous week\u2019s gains as loadings resumed at the crucial Russian export hub of Novorossiysk. The port had been suspended for two days after a Ukrainian attack that disrupted oil shipments, temporarily affecting about 2 percent of global supply. The resumption of these loadings, together with lingering concerns about oversupply from OPEC+ production increases, weighed on market sentiment.\nBrent crude futures dropped 64 cents, or 0.99 percent, to $63.75 a barrel in early Asian trade. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading around $59.32 a barrel, down 63 cents or about 1.05 percent compared to the previous closing prices on Friday. Both benchmarks had gained more than 2 percent last Friday due to the export suspension and regional geopolitical tensions but reversed course after the port restarted operations.\nThe Novorossiysk port, a major outlet for Russia\u2019s oil exports via the Black Sea, was shut due to a Ukrainian drone strike that targeted the energy infrastructure. This incident had raised concerns about further disruptions given ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict dynamics. Although loadings resumed on Sunday, the market remained attentive to possible renewed attacks and uncertainties over Russian oil supply, especially since the United States is set to impose sanctions on major Russian oil companies like Lukoil and Rosneft starting November 21.\nRead more: Oil prices rise to $63.91 amid heightened Ukraine-Russia tensions\nReturn to normalized price levels\nMarket analysts see the combination of resumed Russian exports and OPEC+ keeping production forecasts steady while removing previous supply deficit projections as key factors for the recent price drop. The perception of ample supply, despite geopolitical risks, has led WTI crude prices to stabilize near the $60 mark, fluctuating within a roughly $5 range.\nThroughout the prior month, Brent crude prices had shown moderate gains, rising by approximately 4.66 percent but still remaining about 12.89 percent below levels from a year ago. On Friday, Brent had closed above $64, fueled by worries over halted Russian exports. However, Monday\u2019s session marked a return to more tempered price levels following the supply normalization.\nAdditional market factors influencing prices include the ongoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East, which previously pushed oil prices higher but have recently eased, leading to declining premiums. Furthermore, analysts reference the impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil trading units, with Lukoil reportedly reducing staff cuts shortly ahead of U.S. sanctions taking effect, signaling early supply chain adjustments."

That would drive prices up by 56% to 75% initially to between $140 and $157 a barrel, says the report.\nThe World Bank also describes a \"medium disruption\" risk scenario in which crude reaches $109 to $121 per barrel. In the case of a \"small disruption\" oil prices would increase to a range of $93 to $102 a barrel.\nThe report says high prices of oil and other commodities \"would intensify food insecurity in the region and across the world.\"\n\u201cIf a severe oil price shock materializes, it would push up food price inflation that has already been elevated in many developing countries,\u201d said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the World Bank\u2019s baseline outlook, crude is expected to average $90 a barrel in the current quarter before declining to an average of $81 a barrel in 2024 as the global economy slows.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) crude futures hovered above $82 and $88 per barrel Tuesday midday, down about 8% over the last 10 days.\nPrices surged more than 4% in one day after Hamas attacked Israel earlier this month, amid fears the fighting would bring in nearby Iran, an oil-producing country.\nThe World Bank report points out the conflict's modest impact on commodity prices so far reflects a more diversified world oil supply market, individual countries' petroleum reserves, and reduced overall oil dependence.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Federal employees were directed to return to work on Thursday.\nBloomberg reported on Saturday that European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council Member Olli Rehn cautioned that the risk of slowing inflation should not be overlooked, though upside risks remain. Rehn noted that the euro-area economy is holding up despite disruptions from the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policies, with growth slow but steady. He also emphasized the need for strong bank buffers and a vigilant policy stance.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro are"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Holds 1.1630 as the Dollar Struggles Under 99.40\nThe pair trades above 1.1600 after rejecting the 1.1500 breakdown, with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1660\u20131.1686 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Breaks Its Technical Ceiling As The Pair Confronts A Cross-Market Dollar Reset And A Cluster Of High-Risk Macro Triggers\nEUR/USD is entering one of its most complex phases of 2025, sitting near 1.1630 after a volatile climb from the 1.1500 breakdown attempt earlier this month, and every layer of price action across equities, the DXY, Fed positioning, Eurozone data, and cross-currency flows is now converging on the pair at the same moment. The euro\u2019s rise to 1.1655 this week was not powered by Eurozone strength but by a weakening USD struggling to reclaim its structural levels, specifically the 99.40 threshold on the DXY that continues to function as the global dividing line between dollar stability and renewed dollar weakness. The pair\u2019s recovery began immediately after EUR/USD failed to sustain the break under 1.1500, and that reversal became the trigger for a broader series of higher highs and higher lows that now stretches from 1.1500 to 1.1655, with the current mid-range pivot sitting at 1.1593, a Fibonacci level that has already shifted from resistance into a potential higher-low anchor.\nEUR/USD Strength Emerges From Dollar Vulnerability As The DXY Fights For 99.40 And Faces Pressure From 98.90 And 100.25\nThe U.S. Dollar Index has become the silent architect of every EUR/USD move. The DXY\u2019s rejection from 100.25 and its subsequent failure to reclaim 99.40 on the higher timeframes created the breathing room that allowed EUR/USD to build this entire bullish micro-structure. The USD attempted to break lower toward 98.90 last week, bounced prematurely, and then stalled beneath 99.40, leaving traders without a confirmed dollar trend but forcing them to trade the pair through short-term imbalances instead of stable macro flow. Above the DXY sits unfinished buy-side inefficiency between 100.50 and 100.80, both regions that could quickly realign EUR/USD if tested. The scenario is clear: if the dollar regains 99.40, EUR/USD momentum weakens instantly, exposing 1.1600, 1.1593, and then the deeper 1.1575\u20131.1530 structure. If the DXY remains capped, EUR/USD can continue pressing upward into 1.1668, 1.1686, and 1.1717, three layered levels that define the resistance architecture of the pair.\nEuro Momentum Builds But The Trend Still Battles The Legacy Of September\u2019s Downtrend And The 1.1660 Control Zone\nEUR/USD displays early bullish structure on lower timeframes, yet the pair has not fully dismantled the broader downtrend that began in September. The 1.1660 zone is the center of gravity: a multi-month point of control, a prior resistance shelf, and the exact level where bullish trend confirmation becomes credible. EUR/USD spent more time trading at 1.1660 between July and November than any other price, turning this level into a psychological and structural pivot unmatched in importance. The September low at 1.1608 flipped from resistance to support last week, forming the backbone of this most recent rally, but without a firm break above 1.1660, buyers remain aggressive but unproven. Above 1.1660, the pair must still clear 1.1668, 1.1686, 1.1717, and 1.1748, a stacked wall of chart memory that has rejected bullish attempts in prior months.\nMacro Backdrop Fuels EUR/USD As Investors Navigate A Data Vacuum, Rising Volatility, And Misalignment Between Markets And The Fed\nEUR/USD is benefiting from a unique macro distortion created by delayed U.S. economic data. The prolonged government shutdown withheld key indicators such as CPI, PPI, and NFP, forcing traders to operate on partial information while speculative flows overpower fundamental logic. The only recent major U.S. trigger\u2014the 3.1% CPI reading from November 12\u2014cooled just enough to ignite speculation about rate-cut timelines despite Fed officials staying firmly hawkis"

                "body": "Olli Rehn, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) Governing Council, warned that the risk of inflation slowing should not be disregarded. He mentioned the persistence of upward inflation risks and noted the Eurozone economy\u2019s resilience despite disruptions from trade policies.\nRehn also flagged concerns over financial market vulnerabilities, suggesting that equity valuations appear overstretched and exposed to potential corrections. He identified a mismatch between asset prices and the underlying economic conditions and corporate earnings, stressing the importance of robust bank buffers and vigilant policy measures.\nEurozone Currency Trends\nAt the time of reporting, the EUR/USD pair experienced a minor decrease of 0.06%, trading at 1.1613. The European Central Bank, located in Frankfurt, Germany, manages interest rates and monetary policy for the Eurozone to maintain price stability, aiming for an inflation rate around 2%.\nIn cases of economic stress, the ECB can implement Quantitative Easing (QE) by purchasing assets to influence the market. Conversely, Quantitative Tightening (QT) involves reducing these holdings, which can strengthen the Euro as economic conditions improve.\nWith the date today being November 17, 2025, these comments from the European Central Bank highlight a growing conflict between slowing inflation and lingering financial risks. We have seen Eurozone inflation fall dramatically from its 2022 peaks, now sitting at just 2.1% year-over-year according to the latest data for October 2025. This situation is creating significant uncertainty around the timing of the ECB\u2019s first interest rate cut, which many had priced in for early 2026.\nMarket Strategy Implications\nThis uncertainty from the ECB suggests that volatility in the Euro could increase in the coming weeks. While signs of slowing inflation would normally weigh on the currency, the central bank\u2019s hesitancy to signal a clear path to rate cuts provides a floor of support. For traders using options on the EUR/USD, this could be a good environment to sell strangles, betting that the currency pair remains range-bound as the market digests these conflicting signals.\nThe warning about stretched equity valuations should be taken seriously, as it points to a potential market correction. After the strong rally through 2024, the Euro Stoxx 50 is now trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18, which is high compared to its historical average. Given that the latest figures showed Eurozone GDP growth was a meager 0.1% in the third quarter of 2025, buying protective put options on major European indices offers a way to hedge against a downturn.\nOverall, the ECB is signaling caution on two fronts: a dovish hint on inflation and a hawkish warning on market stability. This divergence makes clear directional bets difficult and points toward an increase in market chop. We should therefore consider strategies that profit from rising volatility, such as buying futures on the VSTOXX index, to position for the price swings that are likely to follow."

The pair failed to escape its lower-realm congestion despite briefly challenging 1.32000, with traders forced to price in the consequences of the U.K.\u2019s fiscal turbulence while the U.S. Dollar waits for clarity from multiple late economic releases. The currency pair remains pressure-sensitive because of the sudden gilt selloff that drove the 10-year yield from 4.44% to 4.55%, a violent shift that immediately triggered liquidation across GBP positions and sent GBP/USD sliding before stabilizing into the weekend near 1.31743. The political narrative around Chancellor Reeves\u2019 budget ambiguity continues to dictate Sterling\u2019s direction more aggressively than macro data, fracturing investor confidence at the exact moment U.S. markets prepare for a heavy slate of delayed NFP, CPI and sentiment prints.\nGBP/USD Volatility Fueled By U.K. Fiscal Uncertainty\nSterling\u2019s selloff began with speculation that Reeves abandoned an income-tax hike in the late-November budget, igniting fears that fiscal tightening would fail to materialize and that the deficit would spiral unfixed. Markets reacted instantly: GBP/EUR collapsed to 1.1280, a 30-month low and the exact level analysts at ING flagged as critical support before warning that a break below could extend losses toward 1.1140. GBP/USD mirrored the move, retracing earlier gains and re-anchoring near 1.31743. The rapid gilt repricing\u2014yields spiking 11 bps in hours\u2014underlined the scale of market discomfort and reflected a liquidation dynamic similar to stress episodes seen in 2022. Even after partial intraday stabilization, Sterling traded jittery as media reports hinted at alternative tax measures such as extended threshold freezes, possible cuts and shifting revenue strategies. Every iteration of uncertainty pushed GBP/USD into renewed choppiness, overriding technical expectations and leaving traders without a stable directional anchor.\nGBP/USD Pressured As U.S. Dollar Reclaims Support From Delayed Macro Data\nThe U.S. Dollar re-established footing as investors priced in the consequences of the 43-day government shutdown, which blocked essential data and forced the Fed to operate without complete visibility ahead of its December meeting. This created a speculative environment rather than one driven by confirmed economic signals. The return of government offices next week means delayed NFP will hit markets on Thursday, accompanied by inflation readings and sentiment data that could sharply alter Fed expectations. GBP/USD\u2014which was trading above 1.34000 before the shutdown\u2014failed to regain that territory because markets no longer assume aggressive rate-cut momentum from the Fed. The last cut came paired with explicit warnings about missing data and uncertainty, cooling prior optimism and supporting USD dips. Risk appetite deteriorated further as global equities softened and PMIs signaled muted activity. This broader risk aversion compressed GBP/USD into a more defensive range and delayed any attempt to retest pre-October levels.\nGBP/USD Technical Structure Shows Compressed Ascending Attempts And Rigid Resistance\nWhile GBP/USD managed to climb into slightly higher short-term terrain late in the week, technical pressure zones remain firm.

This, in turn, could weigh on the GBP in the near term. Bets for a 0.25 percentage point cut have surged to near 80% probability, according to Reuters.\nOn the other hand, traders brace for a backlog of US data following the government's reopening, which they expect will likely point to a weakening economy. This might drag the Greenback lower and create the tailwind for the major pair.\nFinancial markets are now pricing in nearly a 54% chance that the US central bank will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, down from a 62.9% probability that markets priced in earlier last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a p"

                "body": "AUD/USD is steady after Australia\u2019s strong employment report reset interest-rate expectations. Markets have largely abandoned the idea of an RBA cut this year, not because policymakers are hawkish, but because the data isn\u2019t giving them room to ease. With no major domestic releases this week, the Australian dollar will take its direction from the US as agencies begin clearing the backlog of delayed reports following the government shutdown.\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Jumps, ASX Falls as Strong Jobs Data Fuels RBA Hike Bets\n- ASX 200 Slides Further as Tech, Discretionary and Real Estate Crack\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA Hold Puts Focus on AU Jobs, US CPI\n- Senate Moves to End Longest U.S. Government Shutdown in History\nAustralian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Steadies as Jobs Data Shifts RBA Odds\nAustralia\u2019s strong employment report poured cold water on the already low expectations of an RBA cut this year. The figures also hinted that a hike could be the next move, though the RBA would need time to prepare the market for such a reversal. Still, the case is building: inflation remains elevated, jobs data is firm, and Q3 home loans hit a record high \u2014 particularly among investors.\nFor now, I suspect the odds of a hike remain slim \u2014 but incoming data needs to behave. Odds of a 25bp cut in December have fallen to 8% according to the RBA cash rate futures curve, though they still favour a single cut by mid 2026 in line with the RBA\u2019s latest forecasts.\nThe RBA minutes are unlikely to reveal much, as the real concerns lie in the data itself. Wage prices are also unlikely to be a major market mover for AUD/USD traders, leaving Australia without any top-tier domestic releases to focus on this week. That places all the emphasis on US data, assuming it arrives.\nEconomic Data To Pick Up with End of US Government Shutdown\nI provide a more detailed timeline on US data separately, but agencies will now begin backfilling the gaps left by the shutdown. It could take at least a few weeks for the data flow to normalise, and errors or revisions should be expected.\nWith concerns that US growth has softened, the Philadelphia Fed index deserves close attention. It contracted at its fastest pace in six months in September, so any further deterioration could amplify worries \u2014 especially with the index expected to rebound to 8.6 from \u201312.8 previously.\nConsumer sentiment has fallen for three straight months according to the University of Michigan survey, while inflation expectations have declined for four. A weak print \u2014 particularly alongside another soft Philadelphia Fed result \u2014 could revive hopes of a December Fed cut. But recent commentary from Fed officials has already dragged market-implied odds of a December cut down to ~40% from around 65% a couple of weeks ago.\nWill the FOMC Minutes Add Anything New?\nIt\u2019s debatable how much fresh insight the FOMC minutes will offer, given Jerome Powell made it clear at the post-meeting press conference that another rate cut is far from assured. However, he did flag \u201cstrongly differing views\u201d among committee members, so the minutes may show how many opposed the 25bp cut and give a clearer read on how unified the voting members really are.\nAustralian Dollar Performance\n- AUD/USD traded in a tight 15-pip open-to-close range between Tuesday and Friday, highlighting a lack of direction, though it still finished the week 0.7% higher thanks to Monday\u2019s rally.\n- AUD/JPY closed at a one-year high on the back of a weaker yen, with this key risk barometer finishing the week back above 100.\n- AUD/NZD printed a shooting star near 1.16 on Thursday and extended lower on Friday, signalling a pullback. The weekly chart also formed a shooting star, reinforcing the risk of a deeper retracement.\n- EUR/AUD posted a mild bearish inside week, downgrading my bias to neutral after several false breaks in both directions.\n- GBP/AUD hit my downside target a"

                "body": "Japanese Yen seems vulnerable near nine-month low against USD as BoJ uncertainty persists\n- The Japanese Yen kicks off the new week on a softer note amid the BoJ rate-hike uncertainty.\n- The JPY bulls seem rather unimpressed by Japan\u2019s less-worse-than-expected Q3 GDP print.\n- Reduced December Fed rate cut bets underpin the USD and lend support to the USD/JPY pair.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) edges lower against a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD) during the Asian session on Monday and remains close to a nine-month low touched last week. A government report showed earlier today that Japan\u2019s economy contracted in the July-September period for the first time in six quarters. This comes amid Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and support for ultra-loose monetary policy, dampening bets for a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike and undermining the JPY. This, along with a modest USD uptick, assists the USD/JPY pair in holding steady above mid-154.00s.\nThe JPY bears, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets amid speculations that Japanese authorities might step into the markets to stem further weakness in the domestic currency. Apart from this, a weaker risk tone contributes to limiting losses for the safe-haven JPY. The USD, on the other hand, might struggle to attract further buyers amid concerns about the weakening economic momentum on the back of the longest-ever US government shutdown. This, in turn, warrants some caution before positioning for an extension of the USD/JPY pair's recent move up witnessed over the past month or so.\nJapanese Yen bulls remain on the sidelines as weak GDP print fuels BoJ rate hike uncertainty\n- The Cabinet Office reported this Monday that Japan's economy contracted by 0.4% in the July-September period, marking the first fall in six quarters. Furthermore, the Gross Domestic Product fell 1.8% year-on-year in the September quarter following a 2.3% rise in the previous quarter.\n- The readings were less worse than consensus estimates, though pointed to a limited strength in the Japanese economy. This forced investors to pare their bets that the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates soon amid increasing political resistance and undermines the Japanese Yen.\n- Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s administration is compiling a stimulus package to cushion the blow to households from rising living costs. Takaichi said last week that she would work on setting a new fiscal target extending through several years to allow more flexible spending.\n- China and Japan exchanged sharp warnings after Takaichi\u2019s remarks over the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict. In response, China threatened severe consequences, raising the risk of further escalation of tensions and the worsening diplomatic standoff between the two nations.\n- This, in turn, is seen weighing on investors' sentiment and offering some support to the safe-haven JPY. Meanwhile, the recent decline in the JPY prompted some verbal intervention from Japanese authorities. This further holds back the JPY bears from placing fresh bets and limits losses.\n- In fact, Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said last week that she will be watching FX moves with a sense of urgency. Moreover, Japan's Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi said on Friday that a weak JPY can push up CPI through import costs, warranting caution for the JPY bears.\n- Meanwhile, a growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers signaled caution on further easing amid the lack of economic data. This tempers expectations for another interest rate cut by the US central bank in December, which lends some support to the US Dollar and the USD/JPY pair.\n- The market attention now shifts to the delayed release of the closely-watched US Nonfarm Payrolls report on Thursday. Apart from this, FOMC meeting minutes and Fed speeches will be scrutinized for cues about the future rate-cut path, which should provide a fresh impetus to the buck.\nUSD/JPY constructive setup backs the case"

                "body": "Traders braced for USD/JPY volatility in early trading on Monday, November 17, after Japanese GDP data dampened bets on a Bank of Japan rate hike. Last week, the pair climbed to a nine-month high of $155.044. Rising uncertainty about a BoJ rate hike in December clashed with fading expectations of a Fed rate cut.\nCrucially, USD/JPY briefly entered 2024\u2019s 155-160 \u2018intervention zone\u2019 before easing back. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and support for ultra-loose BoJ monetary policy continued to weigh on the yen.\nSince Prime Minister Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party election, USD/JPY has soared 3.4% to 154.52. Notably, Japanese government yen intervention threats helped cap gains so far in the fourth quarter.\nWith uncertainty around the BoJ\u2019s rate path intensifying, the latest third-quarter GDP report added another layer of weakness for the yen.\nThe economy contracted by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the third quarter after expanding 0.6% QoQ in the previous quarter. Softer private consumption and weakening external demand contributed to the loss of economic momentum. The Japanese Cabinet Office reported:\nThe USD/JPY pair had a limited reaction to the third-quarter GDP data, rising from 154.569 to a high of 154.633 after the release. Economists had expected the economy to contract by 0.6%, cushioning the impact on the yen.\nThe USD/JPY pair has soared 4.54% in the fourth quarter. While a weaker yen can boost external demand, import prices are likely to rise, hitting household purchasing power. These trends may complicate the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook, as higher import prices could curb spending but push consumer prices higher.\nOctober\u2019s producer prices highlighted the impact of a weaker yen on import prices. East Asia Econ shared a chart of PPI and import prices, stating:\n\u201cThe gap between import prices and PPI in the October data illustrates the sort of pent-up inflationary pressures in Japan that is likely to be exposed if the JPY remains weak. Today\u2019s data also show a decent rise in auto export prices, but to a level that is still 6% below the pre-tariff level.\u201d\nThis combination of Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s policy goals, economic data, and uncertainty about a BoJ rate hike has pushed USD/JPY higher.\nTraders may also question the lasting effectiveness of further yen intervention threats, given Takaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose policy and fiscal stimulus plans. Significantly, the third quarter GDP numbers call for both, fiscal stimulus and a more dovish BoJ Policy stance.\nWhile Japanese data weighs on BoJ rate hike bets, US economic indicators and Fed speakers will influence US dollar demand later on Monday.\nEconomists expect the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index to drop from 10.7 in October to 6.1 in November. A larger-than-expected drop toward 0 could raise fears of a US recession, weighing on the US dollar. However, the numbers are unlikely to affect the Fed\u2019s policy stance. US inflation and jobs data remain the Fed\u2019s focal points as policymakers await delayed data following the US government reopening.\nMeanwhile, hawkish Fed speeches may send USD/JPY higher during the US session. FOMC members Jefferson and Williams are due to speak. Rising Fed focus on inflation over jobs data could further temper bets on a December Fed rate cut. A less dovish Fed policy stance may send USD/JPY above the November 12 high of 155.044.\nThe key question remains whether concerns about elevated inflation override weaker labor market signals at the December FOMC meeting.\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nFor more in-depth analysis, review today\u2019s USD/JPY trading setups in our latest reports and consult the economic calendar.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

The pair advances as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid lower crude Oil prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price retreats after posting more than 2% gains in the previous session, trading around $59.30 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices depreciate amid looming oversupply concerns.\nRussia\u2019s Novorossiysk port has resumed oil loading operations after a two-day shutdown triggered by a Ukrainian drone strike. Meanwhile, the IEA has warned that the global oil market could face a substantial surplus next year, potentially around 4 million bpd, as both OPEC and non-OPEC producers increase output amid weakening demand growth.\nTraders expect the Bank of Canada (BoE) to hold steady on interest rates through the end of 2026 at a minimum, but that could change if economic conditions deteriorate further. The BoC Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October is scheduled to be released later in the day.\nThe USD/CAD pair also holds gains as the US Dollar (USD) gains amid cautious remarks by US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials. Kansas City Fed President Jeffery Schmid said on Friday that monetary policy should \u201clean against demand growth,\u201d adding that current Fed policy is \u201cmodestly restrictive,\u201d which he believes is appropriate.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that financial markets are now pricing in a 46% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, down from the 67% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors s"

                "body": "Week ahead: Bulls, bears, and the hope the Fed isn\u2019t quietly falling behind the curve\n|Quietly falling behind the curve\nThe tape ended the week like a tired prizefighter leaning on the ropes\u2014not knocked out, just waiting for the bell. A 0.1% lift in the S&P 500 isn\u2019t a rally so much as a heartbeat, with health care and energy keeping the pulse alive while tech tiptoed into next week\u2019s Nvidia verdict. But the real story isn\u2019t in the daily prints\u2014it\u2019s in what happens now that Washington\u2019s lights flicker back on and the data firehose is about to explode after 43 days of silence.\nFor the first time since early October, markets have something resembling a macro compass again. And the question in every strategist\u2019s mind: are we about to discover the Fed is already behind the curve?\nThe shutdown\u2019s end resets the macro game board. The backlog will get cleared, but the distortion will be enormous. We may never get an October unemployment rate. We may never get the October CPI print. Even when the delayed reports do drop, they\u2019ll be riddled with noise\u2014false signals, oversized revisions, data ghosts haunting an already skittish market. Meanwhile, Powell will try to squint through the fog, dismissing Q4 weakness as shutdown flotsam and betting on a Q1 bounce. That\u2019s fine in theory\u2014but it also carries the risk of a central bank lulled into complacency just as the real economy starts shifting beneath its feet.\nBecause out there in the weeds, things aren\u2019t quite lining up.\nThe NFIB survey has rolled over again\u2014small-business earnings collapsing from -16 to -25 in a single month, the mood souring back to tariff-shock levels. Consumer sentiment is even more unnerving: Michigan\u2019s current conditions index has never been this low, not even during the worst of the post-GFC funk. And the public\u2019s one-year unemployment outlook has crashed beneath its Great Recession floor. You don\u2019t need released data to know something under the surface is tightening.\nYet the macro paradox of 2025 is that even as survey sentiment wilts, the hard-activity trackers still look pretty sturdy. The Bloomberg Surprise Index is sitting at +0.25. The NY Fed\u2019s GDP tracker is still pointing to a 2.1% Q4 print that belongs to a much rosier reality. In other words: the models say the plane is cruising; the passengers say they smell smoke.\nAnd the Fed? They\u2019re in a 50-50 coin-flip for December. The market is no longer pricing a clean easing glide path into 2026. A few hawkish nudges from FOMC speakers this week were enough to yank forward-rate expectations into something much knottier\u2014and for an equity market priced like a Faberg\u00e9 egg at 23x forward earnings, these subtle shifts matter.\nBecause here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: the most persuasive bull case for equities right now is simply that Fed tightening isn\u2019t at the door. Historically, bull markets die when Powell\u2019s predecessors slam on the brakes:\n- Late \u201990s \u2192 Fed hikes 150 bps \u2192 dot-com flameout\n- 2007 \u2192 Fed hikes 425 bps \u2192 credit system buckles\n- 2022 \u2192 Fed hikes 500 bps \u2192 pandemic bubble shot down\nEvery major bull market top has had the Fed\u2019s fingerprints on the murder weapon.\nToday? They\u2019re easing. They\u2019re biased to ease more. A dovish FOMC in 2026 could even out-ease the data, intentionally or otherwise. In theory, this is the stuff bull markets feed on\u2014liquidity lubrication, valuation drift, an ever-wider runway for big-cap narratives.\nBut the bears aren\u2019t hallucinating either.\nThe S&P at 23x forward earnings. One standard deviation richer than long-run norms. A concentration so extreme the top-10 names now are the market\u2014over 40% of the index. And much of that premium is built atop the AI capex supercycle, where parts of the narrative are beginning to wobble under their own weight. Expensive can become very expensive\u2014a lesson learned many times\u2014but gravity always returns eventually.\nSo the week ahead is really about the market trying to price the void: the absence of data, the uncertainty around the Fed reaction func"

The dollar value of Harvard\u2019s BTC ETF investment dwarfs the combined total of its holdings in the blue-chip tech stocks Meta, NVIDIA, and the Google operator Alphabet.\nThe filing also shows that IBIT is Harvard\u2019s biggest ETF purchase, and its largest single investment in terms of dollar worth.\nAnd Harvard is not the only member of the Ivy League buying up Bitcoin ETF shares. SEC data shows that Brown University owns 212,500 IBIT shares, worth $13,007,125 when it filed with the SEC on August 8.\nThe Harvard filing, meanwhile, also shows that the university\u2019s fund managers are turning to gold. They have snapped up 661,391 shares in the gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).\nHarvard\u2019s holdings in gold shares are worth $235 million.\nBitcoin ETFs hit sell-off hurdle\nThe rest of Harvard\u2019s portfolio is primarily made up of tech stocks. The university holds significant positions in firms like Microsoft, as well as the chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom.\nIt also holds stocks in the gambling giants Light & Wonder and Flutter Entertainment.\nPension funds across the United States have begun buying Bitcoin ETF shares in recent years. But sell-offs have also become increasingly common.\nEarlier this year, Wisconsin\u2019s Investment Board sold the entirety of its $300 million holdings in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.\nThis month has also seen some investors liquidate their holdings. On November 8, the CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn noted that Bitcoin ETF flows have \u201cdropped by about $2.3 billion from their peak.\u201d\nThis marks the \u201clargest outflow since May 2025,\u201d he added. May saw investors withdraw a total of $4.8 billion from Bitcoin ETFs.\nTim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email at tdalper@dlnews.com."

Yet Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory carved a different path entirely, one defined less by steady compounding than by violent swings that rewarded conviction and punished hesitation.\nThe peak that wasn\u2019t\nBy Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years, according to a BlackRock filing with the SEC.\nBitcoin traded near $115,000 per coin by then, IBIT shares hovered around that level, and the narrative shifted from \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d to \u201chow high can this go?\u201d\nThe 2.5x milestone represented not just arithmetic success but psychological vindication for allocators who endured skepticism about crypto\u2019s place in portfolios governed by Sharpe ratios and correlation matrices.\nThen came October, and Bitcoin registered a new all-time high above $126,000, with IBIT shares priced at $71,29, before sliding through its short-term holder cost basis.\nThe movement triggered cascading liquidations across futures markets, and the leverage that amplified the climb accelerated the descent.\nAs of press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,612.79, and IBIT traded at $54.84, making those September highs look like a mirage.\nThe drawdown from peak erased roughly $6,000 in paper value per initial $10,000 invested, a reminder that Bitcoin\u2019s uncorrelated returns cut both ways.\nWhat the benchmarks missed\nThe equity indices delivered a textbook performance: the S&P 500 achieved its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, and the Nasdaq 100, propelled by the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d saw earnings growth averaging 21.6% year-over-year.\nBoth suffered manageable drawdowns, traded within established ranges, and validated decades of mean-reversion research.\nGold\u2019s 52% year-to-date surge through November 2025 stemmed from macroeconomic dislocation, fueled by tariff uncertainty, Fed pause dynamics, and record central bank purchases, rather than speculative mania. Its correlation to equities stayed negative, fulfilling its portfolio role as designed.\nIBIT offered none of that predictability, with a 98.7% gain since inception deriving from a single-asset bet on a protocol with no earnings, no dividends, and no intrinsic cash flow to discount.\nThe volatility that allowed a 150% peak also permitted a 25% collapse in weeks. Traditional risk models would categorize that profile as unacceptable, and traditional risk-adjusted returns would penalize the path even as they acknowledged the destination.\nYet, the path matters less than the outcome for capital deployed at inception.\nThe investor who bought IBIT on day one and held through the September peak, the November pullback, and every subsequent liquidation cascade still outperformed every major benchmark by a margin wide enough to survive transaction costs, tax drag, and multiple moments of doubt.\nThat investor also experienced standard deviation in returns that would make compliance officers flinch and risk c"

                "body": "Ethereum's latest plunge is more than just a blip on traders' radars; it\u2019s a seismic event that lays bare the turbulent waters of market volatility and the contrasting strategies of institutional investors. As Ethereum grapples with critical price levels, watchers of the market are keen to see how institutional accumulation patterns may herald a resurgence for this digital asset.\nDecoding the Shift in Ethereum's Valuation\nThe fluctuations in Ethereum's price have ignited intrigue among a multitude of stakeholders, both retail and institutional. Recently, the cryptocurrency sank beneath the $3,100 mark, propelled by a fierce wave of selling activity indicative of a significant shift in market psychology. This downturn has rendered Ethereum a riskier proposition in comparison to Bitcoin, prompting institutions to rethink their positions. Notably, the accumulation of 1.64 million ETH by institutional wallets signals that major players are still seeking out long-term investment potential, even amidst the unfurling market chaos.\nThe Echoes of Volatility and Investor Behavior\nThe recent slide in Ethereum's value has triggered an unprecedented wave of liquidations in derivatives trading, exceeding $1.3 billion, underscoring the cryptocurrency's volatile nature. Traders find themselves wrestling with intensified anxiety as they traverse this capricious market, prompting many to eschew leveraged positions altogether. The drastic shifts not only reflect an unpredictable trading landscape but also serve as a testament to the behavioral patterns steeped in apprehension and uncertainty that surface during downturns.\nHistorical Lessons on Recovery in Crypto\nDelving into historical patterns sheds light on the resilience of cryptocurrencies following significant price drops. Analysts note that sharp declines often set the stage for eventual recovery\u2014a strategic play for larger accounts that usually capitalize on discounted assets, mirroring what we currently see with Ethereum. Each dip presents the chance to solidify new support levels, and experts speculate that as long as Ethereum maintains support above the $3,100 benchmark, there\u2019s a plausible roadmap toward recovery, particularly with anticipated institutional purchases as we approach Q4.\nThe Future of Ethereum in the DeFi Space\nDespite the ongoing price fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s long-term scalability remains a linchpin for its future relevance. The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s steadfast dedication to protocol enhancements, paired with visionary initiatives from luminaries like Vitalik Buterin, demonstrates a robust strategy designed to withstand short-term volatility. By prioritizing the reduction of transaction costs while amplifying user scalability, Ethereum is not just poised for a bounce-back; it aims to solidify its position as a leader in the DeFi arena.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe drop in Ethereum's price encapsulates a larger narrative swirling around market volatility, influenced heavily by institutional maneuvering and broader economic factors. As institutions continue to accumulate ETH amidst prevailing sell-offs, the cryptocurrency landscape grows increasingly intricate. For investors and market participants, grasping these dynamics while preparing for potential rebounds isn't merely advisable; it\u2019s vital in navigating this unpredictable terrain. With ongoing developments in Ethereum's infrastructure and its ripple effects on the DeFi ecosystem, its dual identity as both a volatile asset and a cornerstone of the future financial landscape invites engagement and exploration. Make no mistake: now is the moment to immerse yourself in Ethereum\u2019s journey, as it unfolds and reshapes our understanding of finance itself."

                "body": "Over the past decade, Ethereum (ETH 0.84%) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the world. Over that time period, it is up a head-spinning 120,000%.\nBut there are now a growing number of highly regarded Ethereum challengers, and one of the best is Solana (SOL 0.92%). So which is the better investment right now: the entrenched market incumbent (Ethereum) or the upstart rival (Solana)?\nHistorical performance\nBased on past performance, Ethereum would appear to have the advantage over Solana. Its track record over the past five years is particularly impressive. In 2020, Ethereum skyrocketed by 472%, and then followed that up with an equally stellar 2021, when it soared by 395%. In 2023, Ethereum increased in value by 93%, and followed that up with a robust 46% return in 2024.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nThe only down year for Ethereum was 2022, when it lost 68% of its value. If you gave up on Ethereum during the crypto winter of 2022, you probably lost everything. But if you held on to your position, you are likely sitting on a hefty profit right now.\nSolana has been much more volatile than Ethereum. After launching in 2020, Solana nearly doubled in value. It followed that up with an even more impressive 2021, when it was one of the top crypto performers on the planet, up more than 11,000%. However, in 2022, Solana lost more than 94% of its value. Many gave up on it entirely.\nCRYPTO: SOL\nKey Data Points\nWhile Solana rebounded with a sizzling 919% return in 2023, and an 86% return in 2024, it no longer looks like the slam-dunk investment it once did. In 2025, Solana is still down nearly 20% for the year.\nInstitutional support\nHere too, Ethereum appears to have the clear advantage. It has become the preferred blockchain of Wall Street, due to its market dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). And new crypto legislation in the U.S. could make Ethereum even more dominant. That's because Ethereum is far and away the top blockchain when it comes to stablecoins, which have emerged as one of the hottest growth categories in the crypto market.\nWhile Solana shows signs of upending Ethereum's market-leading role in DeFi, it is nowhere close to challenging Ethereum. For example, Ethereum accounts for 63% of all total value locked (TVL), a key metric for measuring DeFi strength. Solana ranks a distant second, with a market share of only 8%.\nKey factors to consider\nBut there are a few factors that could tip the scales in Solana's favor. One of them is its blazing-fast transaction speeds. While the core Ethereum blockchain can only handle 15-30 transactions per second, Solana just demonstrated the ability to handle 100,000 transactions per second. In November 2023, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest suggested that Solana's superior speed, combined with its lower costs, might be enough to migrate developers, users, and institutions over to Solana.\nThere's already been evidence of this within the world of DeFi. Ethereum once dominated in terms of 24-hour trading activity on its decentralized exchanges, but Solana surpassed Ethereum in late 2024, and hasn't looked back since. Much of this has to do with a surge of interest in meme coin trading, where Solana is the clear market leader.\nAlso, in terms of revenue it is creating, Solana is growing at a faster pace than Ethereum. According to a report from 21Shares, the Solana blockchain ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue over the most recent 12-month period.\nAnd the winner is...\nIt's hard to pick against Ethereum. It has been so good, for so long, and has an obvious first-mover advantage over other Layer-1 blockchain networks such as Solana. For good reason, it is the world's second-most popular cryptocurrency, with a hefty market cap of $410 billion.\nBut, if cryptocurrencies are valued the way tech stocks are, then investors also need to focus on future growth prospects and future cash flows. And this is where Solana appears to have the edge. Over time, Solana's superior tran"

Until now, this kind of seamless interaction was limited to rollups (parachains). External bridges could move tokens, but not enable true multi-chain functionality.\nSig.Network changes that. Through its distributed signing layer and message translation system, Sig.Network allows Polkadot accounts and contracts to interact directly with applications on external chains, preserving the caller\u2019s identity and removing the need for wrapped assets or intermediaries. This means Polkadot users and dApps can deposit, trade, lend, and interact natively with ecosystems such as Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin as if they were part of Polkadot itself.\n\u201cOur goal is to make every blockchain feel like it\u2019s part of one unified network,\u201d said David Millar-Durrant, CEO of Sig.Network. \u201cBy bringing Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin into Polkadot\u2019s composable environment, we\u2019re enabling builders to think in flows, not bridges, to create applications that span chains without compromise.\u201d\nSig.Network maps every Polkadot account or contract to a native account (EOA) on each supported external chain. When a Polkadot application sends an XCM v3 message, Sig.Network converts it into a native transaction on the destination blockchain, whether it\u2019s a swap on Uniswap, a deposit on Aave, or a transfer on Solana, while maintaining the origin identity and ensuring verifiable message integrity. Conversely, contracts on external chains can hold Polkadot assets and call back into Polkadot dApps, enabling true two-way interoperability.\nThe integration begins with Hydration, where users will soon be able to deposit BTC, ETH, and SOL as easily as a centralized exchange deposit; trade, lend, and provide liquidity on Hydration without wrapped tokens; access external liquidity sources such as Raydium or Aave directly from Hydration; and allow external apps on Solana or Ethereum to use Hydration\u2019s DeFi functions natively.\nInitial supported chains include Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, with Hyperliquid next on the roadmap. The system launches via an EVM contract on Hub, with progressive integration into Polkadot\u2019s XCM v3 stack to make external calls network-wide.\nExisting cross-chain systems focus on asset movement, wrapping, and limited contract compatibility. In contrast, Sig.Network offers native assets with no wrapping or reissuance, universal contract access allowing any external contract to be called directly, identity preservation so that transactions are executed by the original Polkadot account.\nBy turning message passing into full cross-chain execution, Sig.Network pushes Polkadot\u2019s composability model beyond parachains, redefining what multi-chain means.\n\u201cPolkadot showed the world what interoperable blockchains can achieve,\u201d shared Millar-Durrant. \u201cAt Sig.Network, we\u2019re taking it a step further by connecting external chains so seamlessly that developers can build across ecosystems without even thinking about where one chain ends and another begins.\u201d\nFor more information please visit: https://sig.network/\nPress contact:operations@sig.network\n###\nAbout Sig.Network\nSig.Network makes applications deployed on any chain instantly native across all chains without rewrites, bridges, or regressions. Sig.Network eliminates fragmentation by defining consensus between ecosystems and enabling seamless value flow across crypto. Developer"

                "body": "Over the past decade, Ethereum (ETH 0.84%) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the world. Over that time period, it is up a head-spinning 120,000%.\nBut there are now a growing number of highly regarded Ethereum challengers, and one of the best is Solana (SOL 0.92%). So which is the better investment right now: the entrenched market incumbent (Ethereum) or the upstart rival (Solana)?\nHistorical performance\nBased on past performance, Ethereum would appear to have the advantage over Solana. Its track record over the past five years is particularly impressive. In 2020, Ethereum skyrocketed by 472%, and then followed that up with an equally stellar 2021, when it soared by 395%. In 2023, Ethereum increased in value by 93%, and followed that up with a robust 46% return in 2024.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nThe only down year for Ethereum was 2022, when it lost 68% of its value. If you gave up on Ethereum during the crypto winter of 2022, you probably lost everything. But if you held on to your position, you are likely sitting on a hefty profit right now.\nSolana has been much more volatile than Ethereum. After launching in 2020, Solana nearly doubled in value. It followed that up with an even more impressive 2021, when it was one of the top crypto performers on the planet, up more than 11,000%. However, in 2022, Solana lost more than 94% of its value. Many gave up on it entirely.\nCRYPTO: SOL\nKey Data Points\nWhile Solana rebounded with a sizzling 919% return in 2023, and an 86% return in 2024, it no longer looks like the slam-dunk investment it once did. In 2025, Solana is still down nearly 20% for the year.\nInstitutional support\nHere too, Ethereum appears to have the clear advantage. It has become the preferred blockchain of Wall Street, due to its market dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). And new crypto legislation in the U.S. could make Ethereum even more dominant. That's because Ethereum is far and away the top blockchain when it comes to stablecoins, which have emerged as one of the hottest growth categories in the crypto market.\nWhile Solana shows signs of upending Ethereum's market-leading role in DeFi, it is nowhere close to challenging Ethereum. For example, Ethereum accounts for 63% of all total value locked (TVL), a key metric for measuring DeFi strength. Solana ranks a distant second, with a market share of only 8%.\nKey factors to consider\nBut there are a few factors that could tip the scales in Solana's favor. One of them is its blazing-fast transaction speeds. While the core Ethereum blockchain can only handle 15-30 transactions per second, Solana just demonstrated the ability to handle 100,000 transactions per second. In November 2023, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest suggested that Solana's superior speed, combined with its lower costs, might be enough to migrate developers, users, and institutions over to Solana.\nThere's already been evidence of this within the world of DeFi. Ethereum once dominated in terms of 24-hour trading activity on its decentralized exchanges, but Solana surpassed Ethereum in late 2024, and hasn't looked back since. Much of this has to do with a surge of interest in meme coin trading, where Solana is the clear market leader.\nAlso, in terms of revenue it is creating, Solana is growing at a faster pace than Ethereum. According to a report from 21Shares, the Solana blockchain ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue over the most recent 12-month period.\nAnd the winner is...\nIt's hard to pick against Ethereum. It has been so good, for so long, and has an obvious first-mover advantage over other Layer-1 blockchain networks such as Solana. For good reason, it is the world's second-most popular cryptocurrency, with a hefty market cap of $410 billion.\nBut, if cryptocurrencies are valued the way tech stocks are, then investors also need to focus on future growth prospects and future cash flows. And this is where Solana appears to have the edge. Over time, Solana's superior tran"

On the surface, the \"Meme Downturn\" brought about a significant cooling-off period: daily active addresses decreased, and Solana's user-centricity was gradually eroded by competitors. However, beneath the surface, the fundamentals of this chain became increasingly solid. The Solana core team continued to maintain a high frequency of iteration, driving forward one of the most ambitious technical roadmaps in the crypto industry; at the same time, its TVL grew by over 26% in the third quarter, and stablecoin supply almost tripled since the beginning of the year.\nThis report will systematically review the core technical upgrades that are defining Solana's future (such as Alpenglow, Agave), deeply analyze on-chain data performance, the health of ecosystem applications, and summarize our key insights on how Solana can solidify its position as the \"default high-performance public chain.\"\nWhile most users of the platform are busy chasing the latest meme emojis, the @solana core team has been advancing an ambitious set of system-level upgrade routes. This is not a patch-up of a single metric but a comprehensive system engineering effort to enhance network performance, security, decentralization, and user experience. These upgrades can be broadly categorized into three main types.\nThis involves a fundamental transformation of Solana's \"engine,\" aiming to enhance performance, speed, and security from the most basic level. Here is a great visualization chart, and if you're curious, you can learn more about the current staking ecosystem.\nThe focus of this work is to widen the network \"lanes\" after enhancing the underlying performance, optimizing traffic scheduling to withstand future higher loads without congestion. If there is a hope for institutional users to truly onboard in the future, low latency and a stable experience are foundational, not optional.\nThis category of upgrades is aimed at the most direct developers and end users, with the goal of providing more new features, supporting new types of application formats, and further enhancing the decentralization of the chain. In other words, this is the module that allows the \"chain to do more.\"\nFrom a practical usage perspective:\n\u00b7 Alpenglow: Sub-150ms final confirmation speed enables retail users to use high-frequency DeFi, gaming, or micropayment applications on-chain, with performance approaching the levels of Binance (100ms) and Aptos (200ms).\n\u00b7 Firedancer: Potential capacity exceeding 1 million TPS far surpasses Ethereum and its L2 solutions (such as OP's ~2k TPS), Sui's 300k TPS, and centralized exchanges (Coinbase peaks around 500k TPS). It also significantly reduces systemic risks of single-client failures (Ethereum's Geth still accounts for 60% of nodes).\n\u00b7 Block Space Improvements, Congestion Alleviation, and Transaction Size Limits Optimization: Enhancing the overall experience of using the chain, enabling finer-grained microtransactions and fast transactions, while reducing failures due to congestion.\n\u00b7 Decentralization and Node Cost Reduction: Allowing users with lower technical barriers to run nodes, thereby enhancing the security and decentralization of the entire network.\n\u00b7 ZK and Privacy Support: Providing a compliant, private, and secure foundation for the entry of RWAs and institutional users.\n\u00b7 BAM (Fair Trades, MEV Resistance): Ensuring transaction fairness and protecting users from MEV losses, making the on-chain experience closer to an expected low-cost CLOB environment.\n\u00b7 ACE (Multi-Collateral Liquidity Event): A further push to deepen the DeFi capital markets, enabling them to compete with platforms like Aave, and support more complex financial instruments.\nFrom a data perspective, as traders shift from meme speculation to perpetual"

                "body": "Traders brace for a pivotal week ahead for US stock futures amid rising volatility risks. Futures advanced in the Asian session on Monday, November 17, after a more hawkish Fed rate path triggered market volatility in the previous week.\nAhead of key US events, reports of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi planning a 17 trillion yen stimulus package and Japanese GDP data lifted USD/JPY, boosting carry trade flows. However, last week\u2019s sharp fall in bets on a December Fed rate cut capped the morning gains.\nIt\u2019s a pivotal week for US equity futures, with Nvidia earnings, delayed US economic reports, and Fed speakers under the spotlight.\nAmid fading expectations of a December Fed rate cut, Japanese GDP figures could further delay a Bank of Japan rate hike. The Japanese economy contracted 0.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the third quarter after expanding 0.6% in the second quarter.\nThe third-quarter economic contraction, fading bets on a BoJ rate hike, and a weaker Japanese yen may fuel carry trades, boosting demand for US stock futures. Notably, USD/JPY rose 0.08% to 154.646 in morning trading, hovering near last week\u2019s nine-month high of 155.044.\nFurthermore, the third-quarter contraction supported Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and ultra-loose monetary policy stance, headwinds for the yen.\nFutures steadied during the Asian session after last week\u2019s heightened volatility. The Dow Jones E-mini rose 12 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 146 points, while the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 22 points.\nLater on Monday, US economic data and Fed speakers will take center stage. Traders should closely monitor Fed speeches that could further sink bets on a December rate cut. US stock futures may come under intense selling pressure if Fed speakers close the door on further monetary policy easing.\nEconomists expect the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index to fall from 10.7 in October to 6.1 in November. A sharper loss of sector momentum amid an elevated inflation backdrop may fuel stagflation concerns, weighing on risk assets.\nHowever, Fed speakers will likely have a greater influence on sentiment. NY Fed President John Williams and voting FOMC member Philip Jefferson are due to speak. Calls to delay rate cuts to tame inflationary pressures could weigh on US stock futures. Rising prices and slowing economic momentum would signal stagflation, a headwind for risk assets.\nFed speakers dampened bets on a December rate cut last week, citing concerns over inflation being too hot. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December cut fell from 66.9% on Friday, November 7, to 44.4% on Friday, November 14.\nLooking ahead, traders should monitor stagflation risks as the primary driver for futures. Furthermore, traders must also watch for any sharp yen appreciation that could amplify volatility through carry trade unwinding.\nDespite last week\u2019s volatility, US stock futures traded above their key technical levels, signaling a bullish bias. Near-term trends will hinge on incoming US data, Fed chatter, and earnings. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nUS economic data and Fed speakers could intensify market volatility as central bankers and markets react to delayed US economic reports. The US government shutdown left markets and the Fed without crucial inflation and labor market data for an extended period.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia will release its earnings, another key event given recent concerns about lofty valuations for AI stocks.\nGiven these competing market forces, US stock futures are in for a choppy start to the week.\nFollow our live coverage and consult the economic calendar for real-time market updates.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

Here\u2019s what you should know before the ASX opens today\u2026\nAt 7am AEDT, ASX futures were already limping, down 0.25% and setting the tone for a soggy Monday open.\nHere\u2019s what went down on Friday\u2026\nWall Street\u2019s wobbly finish\nWall Street capped a wild week with a mixed close.\nOn Friday, the Dow dropped 0.65%, the S&P 500 was basically flat, and the Nasdaq scraped out a 0.13% gain \u2013 which, considering Thursday\u2019s bloodbath, felt like a mercy bounce.\nFriday started ugly, the sharpest one-day sell-off in over a month. But then AI panic turned into dip-buying.\nTesla did its usual Tesla thing \u2013 unpredictable, and cracking below US$400 before somehow turning green. Nvidia flipped from red to positive.\nIntel is watching AMD eat its lunch in real time. AMD CEO Lisa Su literally told analysts she expects AMD to take \u201cupwards of 50% of CPU server revenue market share.\nMeanwhile, the VIX or fear index smashed above 20, its highest in a month and a sign traders are bracing for impact.\nTraders now see less than 50% chance of a December Fed rate cut \u2013 down from 95% a month ago.\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari warned about \u201cresilience\u201d in the economy and inflation, which is Fed code for: don\u2019t get your hopes up, mate.\nThe AI reckoning\nWall Street strategists couldn\u2019t help themselves. When tech sells off, someone has to give it a name.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Daniel Skelly came in swinging: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened recently in the market isn\u2019t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right, in a way. AI stocks have run so hard this year that any wobble looks like a crisis.\nBut then UBS stepped in, soothing everyone..\nUBS says this is a bull market and expects the S&P 500 to hit 7,300 by June 2026, which is delightfully optimistic.\nGold predictions\nGold fell by 2% on Friday after surging toward US$4,200 as traders hunted for safety.\nThe World Gold Council (WGC) reckons the next big swing in 2026 will come down to two things: US tariffs and the Fed\u2019s next round of rate surgery.\n\u201cIf the trade tariff issues are settled, some market risks may subside, reducing any major impact on gold prices,\u201d said WGC\u2019s Shaokai Fan.\nHe added that any rate cuts would likely send bullion higher.\nBitcoin fell to US$95k\nThat wasn\u2019t even the dramatic bit. The dramatic bit is that several on-chain indicators now point to BTC entering a bear market.\n10X Research wrote: \u201cThere is currently no meaningful marginal buyer stepping in.\u201d\nETF outflows have now hit their second-highest level of the year. And if BTC breaks US$93k, 10X Research says it could fall \u201ceven further in the near term\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s happening this week\nForget the dozens of releases. Only one truly matters.\nThe delayed September US jobs report, which is dropping on Thursday, Nov 20, US time.\nIt\u2019s the first full jobs read since the six-week government shutdown froze the entire data pipeline. And it\u2019s the report the Fed desperately needs before its December meeting.\nWhat will it mean for Aussie investors?\nIt will set the tone for the ASX right into December \u2013 especially after a week where CBA tanked, labour data surprised, and everyone suddenly remembered the RBA isn\u2019t exactly in a cutting mood.\nCommodity/forex/crypto market prices\nWhat got you talking\nAlso in the news\u2026\nMonsters of Rock: Record prices open whole new world for gold stocks.\nPrecision Points: Rare earths are all the rage, but these unloved commodities could hide bigger opportunities.\nUranium is coming back into play as America outlines its nuclear ambitions.\nHigh Voltage: Lithium miners are making market waves as spodumene prices pass US$1000/t.\nShutdown ends as markets brace for torrent of delayed US data.\nTrading halts\n3D Energi (ASX:TDO) \u2013 update on drilling operations\nAirtasker (ASX:ART) \u2013 cap raise\nCobre (ASX:CBE) \u2013 strategic placement\nEtherstack (ASX:ESK) \u2013 cap raise\nForrestania "

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) managed to finish the week slightly higher, though both were hit with sharp pullbacks on Thursday.\nA full return to a complete slate of economic data after the shutdown's end remains up in the air. But investors will get their first official government snapshot of the labor market this week with the long-awaited release of September's jobs report on Thursday. The report will provide a delayed picture of the jobs market in the US, as a more cautious tone from Fed officials last week throws doubt on the central bank's rate move next month.\nThe coming week sees some of the last major releases for earnings season, particularly for AI trade. Nvidia (NVDA) is set for its blockbuster report on Wednesday, always an intensely scrutinized event. Investors will also get fresh insight into consumer strength as retailers led by Walmart (WMT) report. Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), Lowe's (LOW), and Gap (GAP) also release reports this week.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), meanwhile, is serving as a health check for the crypto market at large, as the coin dropped 30% in a little over a month from a record high of over $126,000 to below $94,000. The drop erased year-to-date gains that were sparked by the Trump administration's more crypto-friendly stance and indicated investors could be shifting to a risk-off mindset."

                "body": "Traders brace for a pivotal week ahead for US stock futures amid rising volatility risks. Futures advanced in the Asian session on Monday, November 17, after a more hawkish Fed rate path triggered market volatility in the previous week.\nAhead of key US events, reports of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi planning a 17 trillion yen stimulus package and Japanese GDP data lifted USD/JPY, boosting carry trade flows. However, last week\u2019s sharp fall in bets on a December Fed rate cut capped the morning gains.\nIt\u2019s a pivotal week for US equity futures, with Nvidia earnings, delayed US economic reports, and Fed speakers under the spotlight.\nAmid fading expectations of a December Fed rate cut, Japanese GDP figures could further delay a Bank of Japan rate hike. The Japanese economy contracted 0.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the third quarter after expanding 0.6% in the second quarter.\nThe third-quarter economic contraction, fading bets on a BoJ rate hike, and a weaker Japanese yen may fuel carry trades, boosting demand for US stock futures. Notably, USD/JPY rose 0.08% to 154.646 in morning trading, hovering near last week\u2019s nine-month high of 155.044.\nFurthermore, the third-quarter contraction supported Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and ultra-loose monetary policy stance, headwinds for the yen.\nFutures steadied during the Asian session after last week\u2019s heightened volatility. The Dow Jones E-mini rose 12 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 146 points, while the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 22 points.\nLater on Monday, US economic data and Fed speakers will take center stage. Traders should closely monitor Fed speeches that could further sink bets on a December rate cut. US stock futures may come under intense selling pressure if Fed speakers close the door on further monetary policy easing.\nEconomists expect the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index to fall from 10.7 in October to 6.1 in November. A sharper loss of sector momentum amid an elevated inflation backdrop may fuel stagflation concerns, weighing on risk assets.\nHowever, Fed speakers will likely have a greater influence on sentiment. NY Fed President John Williams and voting FOMC member Philip Jefferson are due to speak. Calls to delay rate cuts to tame inflationary pressures could weigh on US stock futures. Rising prices and slowing economic momentum would signal stagflation, a headwind for risk assets.\nFed speakers dampened bets on a December rate cut last week, citing concerns over inflation being too hot. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December cut fell from 66.9% on Friday, November 7, to 44.4% on Friday, November 14.\nLooking ahead, traders should monitor stagflation risks as the primary driver for futures. Furthermore, traders must also watch for any sharp yen appreciation that could amplify volatility through carry trade unwinding.\nDespite last week\u2019s volatility, US stock futures traded above their key technical levels, signaling a bullish bias. Near-term trends will hinge on incoming US data, Fed chatter, and earnings. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nUS economic data and Fed speakers could intensify market volatility as central bankers and markets react to delayed US economic reports. The US government shutdown left markets and the Fed without crucial inflation and labor market data for an extended period.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia will release its earnings, another key event given recent concerns about lofty valuations for AI stocks.\nGiven these competing market forces, US stock futures are in for a choppy start to the week.\nFollow our live coverage and consult the economic calendar for real-time market updates.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

                "body": "Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\nRussell Brand had found his people, that much was clear. Last Saturday, in front of 800 fans in a hotel ballroom in Austin, the comedian doled out praise for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (whom he called \u201cGreat Brother Kennedy\u201d), disdain for the medical establishment (\u201cflat-out evil\u201d), and gratitude for Jesus Christ (\u201cThank God we have a forgiving God that died for us\u201d). He also told a bunch of dick jokes and, later, called me a Nazi.\nAfter the show, I\u2019d asked Brand for an interview, and he told me that the media are \u201cLuciferian,\u201d and that reporters are Nazis. \u201cDo you really think that?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re more like an individual Nazi,\u201d he said, seemingly a concession that I was just following orders. (I didn\u2019t get the interview.)\nBrand and his fans had gathered for the annual conference of Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit founded in 2018 by the current secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy wasn\u2019t there, but the movement\u2019s other headliners were. Brand\u2014who is awaiting trial for rape and sexual assault in the U.K. and has pleaded not guilty\u2014was onstage with Kennedy\u2019s wife, Cheryl Hines, to promote her memoir. Her publisher, Tony Lyons, was there in his role as president of MAHA Action, a nonprofit that holds weekly Zoom calls to galvanize support for Kennedy\u2019s agenda. Also on the scene were Andrew Wakefield, who\u2019s infamous for his discredited 1998 Lancet study on the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism, along with newer adherents such as Bret Weinstein, the evolutionary biologist, COVID-vaccine critic, and podcast host.\nEveryone I spoke with at the conference shared a distrust of vaccines and a sense that, after they\u2019d spent years on the fringes of scientific discourse, Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had given them the legitimacy they once lacked. (The theme of the event was \u201cMoment of Truth.\u201d) As Polly Tommey, the program director of the organization\u2019s video-and-audio operation, told the audience: \u201cWe never thought Bobby would be health secretary\u2014I mean, come on! We\u2019re in the best place we\u2019ve been for ages!\u201d But what should have been a victory lap at times felt like an attempt to rally the troops, or at least reassure them.\nKennedy\u2019s tenure has been turbulent. In less than a year, he\u2019s sent mixed signals about the benefits of vaccination during a measles outbreak, fired all of the CDC\u2019s outside vaccine advisers and replaced them with his allies, axed the director of the CDC just weeks after she took the job, and stoked fears about prenatal Tylenol use as a cause of autism despite recent conflicting evidence. A string of top CDC officials, including the chief science officer, has resigned, and those who remain say morale has never been lower.\nBut the Kennedy faithful don\u2019t care about the health secretary flouting institutional norms or sidelining subject-matter experts, because they view HHS, and the CDC in particular, as either useless or corrupt. In fact, some at the conference worried that Kennedy is not acting with enough urgency. (In an email, the HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote that Kennedy \u201cremains committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to accurate, evidence-based information about vaccines.\u201d)\nThey want Kennedy to investigate their belief that the government supposedly colluded with Big Pharma to hide the harms of vaccination. In a session on Saturday afternoon, former Republican Representative Dave Weldon, whose nomination to become CDC director was withdrawn in March amid outcry over his criticism of immunizations, called for the creation of an independent body to investigate vaccine-safety data and report only to Kennedy and President Donald Trump. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the hands of the CDC, you\u2019ll never get the answers you need,\u201d he told the crowd. During a session titled \u201cThe Enduring Nightmare of COVID mRNA Technology,\u201d Sherri Tenpenny, a veteran anti-vaccine activist who once said that one goal of COVID vaccination was to turn people into \u201ctran"

Surveys\u2026 indicate that the overall business conditions in the export sector have not deteriorated due to the US tariff hikes, and corporate willingness to invest in equipment remains solid,\u201d Kono said.\nChina tensions\nMarcel Thieliant at Capital Economics warned however that current tensions with China following Takaichi\u2019s comments about Taiwan risk escalating \u201cinto a full-blown trade spat\u201d.\n\u201cThere are several avenues through which this could play out, but the biggest risk is that China restricts exports of rare earths or imposes restrictions on Japanese exports,\u201d Thieliant said before the GDP release.\n\u201cCarmakers look particularly vulnerable as they are already under enormous pressure from the ascent of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers,\u201d he added.\nTakaichi told parliament on November 7 that an armed attack on Taiwan could warrant sending troops to the island under \u201ccollective self-defence\u201d.\nTravel ban\nChina and Japan last week summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors, with Beijing advising its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan.\nBeijing insists Taiwan, which Japan occupied for decades until 1945, is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to seize control.\nChina and Japan are key trading partners, but historical mistrust and friction over territorial rivalries and military spending often test those ties.\nThe data from the cabinet office also showed that a drag on economic growth was weak residential investment.\nTrade officials in July reached a deal that saw the United States lower tariffs on Japanese goods to 15 percent from a threatened 25 percent.\nJapanese cars were taxed at a higher rate of 27.5 percent and the reduction to 15 percent did not take effect until mid-September."
