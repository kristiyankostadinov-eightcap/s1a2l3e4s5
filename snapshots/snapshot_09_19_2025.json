                "body": "Gold futures continued their downward trajectory on September 18, surrendering gains despite the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. The precious metal's decline suggests that investors may be engaging in profit-taking activities after gold reached elevated price levels in recent sessions.\nDecember gold contracts settled $16.40 lower, representing a 0.44% decline to $3,678.20 on Thursday's trading session. Silver futures similarly retreated, closing lower by $0.03 or 0.08% at $42.12. Both precious metals encountered resistance from U.S. dollar strength that has persisted over the past two trading sessions.\nMarket analysts attribute gold's recent weakness to investor disappointment over the Federal Reserve's measured approach to monetary easing. The central bank's quarter-point rate reduction fell short of some market participants' expectations for a more aggressive half-point cut, leading to a reassessment of the Fed's dovish stance.\nThe economic backdrop presents a mixed picture for precious metals. Recent unemployment data revealed a sharp decline in initial jobless claims, indicating some resilience in the labor market. However, broader employment trends paint a more concerning picture, with the U.S. economy adding fewer than 30,000 jobs per month on average over the past quarter\u2014a significant deceleration from the robust pace of over 100,000 monthly additions observed earlier this year.\nGold experienced intraday volatility, falling more than 1% during the session as market participants interpreted the Federal Reserve's policy communications as less accommodative than previously anticipated. This reaction occurred despite the rate cut and the central bank's signals indicating potential for additional monetary easing in future meetings.\nThe precious metal's performance reflects the complex interplay between monetary policy expectations, currency dynamics, and investor sentiment in the current market environment. As gold traditionally benefits from lower interest rates and currency debasement concerns, the measured pace of Federal Reserve easing has prompted investors to reassess their positions in the safe-haven asset.\nFor those that would like more information about our services click here\nWishing you as always good trading,"

                "body": "- The Gold price drifts lower to around $3,640 in Friday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Fed decided to cut rates by 25 bps while signaling two more reductions this year.\n- Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could boost the safe-haven flows, supporting the Gold price.\nThe Gold price (XAU/USD) trades in negative territory for the second consecutive day near $3,640 during the early Asian session on Friday. The precious metal edges lower after reaching a record high in the previous session due to some profit-taking and a firmer US Dollar (USD).\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut the interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) and signaled two more reductions by the end of this year. This is the Fed's first reduction this year and puts the target range for its main lending rate at 4.0% - 4.25%.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the latest move to lower interest rates was a risk management cut and added that he doesn't feel the need to move quickly on rates. A less dovish stance from the US central bank provides some support to the Greenback and weighs on the USD-denominated commodity price in the near term.\n\"Investors judged the Fed's guidance less dovish than anticipated,\" said MUFG analyst Soojin Kim. \"Chair Powell highlighted tariff-driven inflation risks and stressed a 'meeting-by-meeting' approach to further cuts, sending the dollar higher,\" Kim added.\nOn the other hand, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could boost the yellow metal, a traditional safe-haven asset. Israeli media reports indicated the military is preparing for a major ground incursion into Gaza City. For weeks, Israel has been laying the groundwork for such an operation, urging civilians to evacuate to designated humanitarian areas like Al-Mawasi.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country\u2019s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.\nThe price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

However, production has entered a robust upward phase this year due to the ramp-up of offshore installations and the launch of new projects.\nPreliminary data for July from the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo (ANP) revealed a notable upward revision, showing oil production rising by 200,000 b/d month-on-month to reach a record high of 4 million b/d, an increase of 720,000 b/d year-on-year. Preliminary ANP figures for August indicate a slight decline of 50,000 b/d, primarily due to operational issues at the Petrobras-operated Mero 2 and Equinor Energy-operated Peregrino projects.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) projects Brazil\u2019s overall production to rise by an unprecedented average of 400,000 b/d this year, reaching 3.8 million b/d, with an additional gain of 180,000 b/d anticipated in 2026.\nThis robust growth is a key component of Petrobras' ambitious multi-year plan to deploy floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels in a systematic manner. In addition to the five FPSOs launched in 2023, another six are expected to be operational by mid-2025, with one more anticipated later this year and an additional one next year.\nCollectively, the eight FPSOs being put into service from 2024 to 2026 will have a combined capacity of just over 1.3 million b/d, nearly double that of current UK production. For the FPSOs currently in operation, utilization rates have recently surged to nearly 75%, a significant increase from 63% in second-quarter 2025 and substantially higher than last year's average of 45%."

The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is July 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output for July 2025 was revised down by 73 kb/d and June 2025 output was revised higher by 5 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report. OPEC 12 output increased by 478 kb/d with the largest increases from Saudi Arabia (258 kb/d), Iraq (122 kb/d), UAE (87 kb/d) and Kuwait (40 kb/d). Iran (27 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases or decreases of 13 kb/d or less (net decrease for all other OPEC members of 1 kb/d).\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 1378 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 19471 kb/d in August 2025. The Big 4 may have about 1378 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 19471 kb/d, and increase of 1125 kb/d in just 4 months (an average monthly increase of 281 kb/d.) Also the increase in Big 4 output over the past 4 months is 13 kb/d more than the OPEC 12 increase.\nThe chart above shows the most recent 36 month average annual increase of 134 kb/d for the Other 6 OPEC group which excludes the Big 4 and Iran and Venezuela. Iran and Venezuela have seen their output rise over the past 3 years at an annual rate of 405 kb/d which I believe will fall to zero in the near future. The chart below shows the long term trend for the OPEC Other 6 which is roughly flat (a small average annual rate of decrease of 8 kb/d over the past 11 years.)

For the most recent 4 quarters the average World refinery throughput was 81.52 Mb/d, the previous 4 quarters had average refinery throughput at 81.09 Mb/d and 2024 had refinery throughput at 81.03 Mb/d. If the recent rate of increase continues (490 kb/d in 9 months) we may see a new peak in annual average World refinery throughput in 2025 or 2026.\nPreliminary July 2025 data show that OECD commercial inventories stood at 2,761 Mb, a build of\n2.4 Mb from the previous month. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 66.5 Mb less than the same time last year, 128.5 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 208.6 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC has again revised its estimate of US tight oil output lower compared to the previous month.

However, production has entered a robust upward phase this year due to the ramp-up of offshore installations and the launch of new projects.\nPreliminary data for July from the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo (ANP) revealed a notable upward revision, showing oil production rising by 200,000 b/d month-on-month to reach a record high of 4 million b/d, an increase of 720,000 b/d year-on-year. Preliminary ANP figures for August indicate a slight decline of 50,000 b/d, primarily due to operational issues at the Petrobras-operated Mero 2 and Equinor Energy-operated Peregrino projects.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) projects Brazil\u2019s overall production to rise by an unprecedented average of 400,000 b/d this year, reaching 3.8 million b/d, with an additional gain of 180,000 b/d anticipated in 2026.\nThis robust growth is a key component of Petrobras' ambitious multi-year plan to deploy floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels in a systematic manner. In addition to the five FPSOs launched in 2023, another six are expected to be operational by mid-2025, with one more anticipated later this year and an additional one next year.\nCollectively, the eight FPSOs being put into service from 2024 to 2026 will have a combined capacity of just over 1.3 million b/d, nearly double that of current UK production. For the FPSOs currently in operation, utilization rates have recently surged to nearly 75%, a significant increase from 63% in second-quarter 2025 and substantially higher than last year's average of 45%."

The Federal Reserve delivered a widely expected 25 basis point rate cut, lowering its target range to 4.0%\u20134.25%, while its projections signal another 50bps of easing before year-end. The decision initially pushed the euro as high as 1.1878, its strongest since September 2021, but profit-taking and a rebound in the U.S. dollar capped the move.\nLabor Market Data and Philly Fed Index Take Center Stage\nTraders are shifting focus toward upcoming U.S. jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which could define the next directional move in EUR/USD. Jobless claims are expected at 240K, down from 263K the prior week, while continuing claims are projected to edge higher to 1.95 million. A stronger labor print would lend support to the dollar, while weak data could allow the euro to retest 1.1870\u20131.1900. The Philly Fed index, seen rebounding to 2.3 in September from -0.3 in August, could add further volatility to intraday trading.\nPowell Balances Dovish Shift With Inflation Concerns\nFed Chair Jerome Powell described the rate reduction as a \u201crisk management cut,\u201d stressing that inflation risks remain elevated into 2026. While the dot plot median reflects two additional cuts in 2025 and another in 2026, dissent was evident. Newly appointed governor Stephen Miran favored a more aggressive 50bps cut, while hawkish members leaned toward keeping rates closer to 4.4% into year-end. This divergence explains why the dollar regained strength after Powell\u2019s press conference, tempering EUR/USD\u2019s advance.\nEurozone Inflation Eases While ECB Holds Firm\nData from Europe showed the HICP inflation index rising just 0.1% in August, with the annual pace cooling to 2.0%, below expectations. Core inflation held steady at 3.1% year-on-year, leaving the European Central Bank with little urgency to tighten further. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos suggested policy remains \u201cappropriate\u201d and emphasized the need to tolerate small deviations from the inflation target. The euro briefly ticked higher during his comments, though gains proved short-lived.\nRead More\n-\nSCHD ETF Analysis: $27.45 Price, 3.73% Yield, Dividend Growth Outlook\n18.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETFs Fuel $117,000 BTC-USD Surge as Fed Cuts Rates\n18.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price at $9,943: Fed Cut, Dollar Rebound, and 880k Tons Lost Supply Shape Market\n18.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price at 146.80: Fed Cuts Rates, BoJ Holds at 0.5%, Traders Watch 145\u2013150 Range\n18.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Landscape: 1.1800 as Key Support, 1.1900 as Resistance\nPrice action shows EUR/USD consolidating within a well-defined channel. The pair has tested support at 1.1800 multiple times, with additional downside protection seen at 1.1755 and the 1.1730 trendline from late August. A sustained close below 1.1730 would shift sentiment bearish, opening the door toward 1.1700 and 1.1650. On the upside, the immediate barrier remains 1.1878, followed by 1.1935 based on Fibonacci retracements, before the critical 1.2000 psychological level. The 14-day RSI near 60 supports a cautiously bullish bias, while the MACD on the 4-hour chart is signaling a potential correction.\nDollar Index Correlation Keeps Pressure on the Euro\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 96.90, retreating from 97.25 resistance but still holding above 96.60 support. This range-bound behavior keeps the euro capped, as a dollar recovery above 97.70 would likely drag EUR/USD back toward 1.1750"

The pair faces challenges as the US Dollar (USD) continues to attract buyers following the release of the United States (US) Weekly Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday. Traders await the German Producer Price Index (PPI) data for August due later in the day.\nThe US Department of Labour (DOL) released on Thursday, the number of US citizens submitting new applications for unemployment insurance declined to 231K for the week ending September 13. The latest print came in short of initial estimates of 240K and was lower than the previous week\u2019s 264K (revised from 263K). Meanwhile, Continuing Jobless Claims shrank by 7K to 1.920M for the week ending September 6.\nThe US Dollar remains stronger after the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered an expected rate cut on Wednesday but signaled no rush to lower borrowing costs quickly in the coming months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to growing signs of weakness in the labor market to explain why officials decided it was time to cut rates after holding them steady since December amid concerns over tariff-driven inflation.\nThe downside of the EUR/USD pair could be restrained as the Euro (EUR) may receive support from rising expectations of the European Central Bank (ECB) ending the rate cut cycle following the latest inflation figures.\nECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said that the central bank should follow a \"very prudent\" approach given the high uncertainty. Guindos added that the current rate is appropriate given inflation trends and the transmission of monetary policy. ECB Governing Council members Martins Kazaks and Gediminas Simkus said earlier this week that interest rates do not need further cuts at the moment, though they did not rule out a potential move in the future.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the "

Powell\u2019s pushback against a larger 50bp cut wrongfooted traders who had pre-emptively positioned for a jumbo-sized move, which is usually reserved for times of crisis.\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to hold interest rates at 0.5% today while presenting a cautiously optimistic outlook. Traders will be watching for any hints of an October hike, which an ex-BOJ official believes is likely, even if ultra-dovish Sanae Takaichi wins the election. Strong corporate profits and steady wage hikes are seen as sufficient justification for the BOJ to act in Q4.\nHowever, with no \u201csources\u201d in the media leaking clues ahead of today\u2019s meeting, it seems unlikely the BOJ will commit to signalling a move now. That could allow the Japanese yen to weaken further in line with recent momentum \u2013 a scenario that would continue to support USD/JPY and EUR/JPY bulls.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY Outlook: Dollar, Yen Weakness Into FOMC, BOJ\n- EUR/GBP Outlook: Euro Favoured as Dollar Declines, British Pound Lags\n- EUR/USD, USD/JPY, VIX, Gold, Crude oil: COT Report Analysis\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nUSD/JPY and EUR/JPY Technical Outlook Ahead of BOJ Decision\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe US dollar\u2019s rebound and low expectations of a BOJ hike has meant that USD/JPY has failed to break materially lower from its range once again.

Bulls could seek pullbacks to the monthly pivot point (147.50) and target the monthly S1 pivot around the 200-day SMA.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nEUR/JPY Technical Analysis: Euro vs Japanese Yen\nThe euro (EUR) has broken higher against the Japanese yen (JPY), with EUR/JPY now trading at its strongest level since July 2025. This bullish breakout could open the path towards retesting the 2025 highs. With the daily trend structure firmly intact, traders may look for continuation signals on intraday charts or pullbacks into support zones.\nShould a retracement unfold on the daily timeframe, key support levels include the monthly S1 pivot at 173.30, the 20-day EMA at 172.65, and the rising bullish trendline from the August low. Given the momentum, a retest \u2013 or even a potential breakout \u2013 of the 2025 high remains a realistic target for euro bulls.\nNear-term resistance sits at the high-volume node (HVN) at 174.26 and the monthly R2 pivot at 174.75, which could temporarily cap upside and prompt a minor pullback.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/JPY\nKey Economic Events for Traders (AEST / GMT+10)\n07:00 NZD Westpac Consumer Sentiment (NZD/USD, AUD/NZD, NZD/JPY)\n08:45 NZD Exports, Imports, Trade Balance (Aug) (NZD/USD, AUD/NZD, NZD/JPY)\n09:01 GBP GfK Consumer Confidence (Sep) (GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, GBP/JPY)\n09:30 JPY CPI, National CPI, National Core CPI (Aug) (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Nikkei 225)\n09:50 JPY Foreign Bonds Buying, Foreign Investments in Japanese Stocks (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Nikkei 225)\n12:30 JPY BoJ Monetary Policy Statement (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Nikkei 225)\n13:00 JPY BoJ Interest Rate Decision (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Nikkei 225)\n13:00 NZD Credit Card Spending (Aug) (NZD/USD, AUD/NZD, NZD/JPY)\n16:00 GBP Retail Sales, Core Retail Sales, Public Sector Borrowing, Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (Aug) (GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, FTSE 100)\n16:30 JPY BoJ Press "

The GBP/USD trades at 1.3551 after hitting a daily high of 1.3660.\nThe economic schedule on both sides of the Atlantic has been busy. Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending September 13 came at 231K, below forecasts of 240K and the previous week upward revised 264K. Continuing Claims dipped from 1.939 million to 1.92 million\nAlthough the data was positive, hiring has slowed as most economists blamed tariffs. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that the lack of immigration is another reason weighing on the labor market.\nEarlier, the Bank of England maintained the Bank Rate at 4% as expected, on a 7-2 vote split and reduced the Quantitative Tightening (QT) from \u00a3100 billion to \u00a370 billion. Worth noting, in the previous meeting the BoE reduced rates even though inflation in the UK is almost twice the bank\u2019s 2% target.\nBoE Governor Andrew Bailey said that there will be more rate cuts, though added that the timing and scale is uncertain.\nAhead, the UK economic docket will feature Retail Sales data. In the US, the calendar is empty, though traders should be aware that the Fed blackout period ended and that some officials could cross the newswires.\nThe GBP/USD shifted from being upward biased, to consolidate within the 1.3500 \u2013 1.3650 area as an \u201cevening star\u201d emerges. If bears would like to push the exchange rate lower, they must clear the 20-day SMA at 1.3521, followed by the September 11 swing low of 1.3491. Once cleared, the next area of interest would be the confluence of the 100 and 50-day SMAs at around 1.3475/62.\nOn the flip side, a GBP/USD daily close above 1.3600, could cement the case for another attempt to challenge the yearly peak at 1.3788.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created "

Retail Sales data is not typically adjusted by total sales volume, and high inflation can skew the sales figures to the upside.\nFunctionally, Retail Sales cannot differentiate between consumers struggling to pay for the same amount of goods with a larger proportion of their paycheque, and consumers properly injecting wage gains into the domestic economy.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The downbeat data highlighted weakness in the labor market. However, it was not enough to significantly shift the outlook for rate cuts. Traders are still expecting the RBA to hold rates this month.

The break had indicated a momentary shift in sentiment to bearish. However, to maintain the new bias, the price must remain below the SMA and the RSI under 50.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Canada forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nBefore the sentiment shift, AUD/USD was trading in a steep bullish trend, keeping above the 30-SMA. At the same time, it was making higher highs and lows until it got to the 0.6700 key resistance level. Here, the price formed a large top wick on a bearish candle, showing a rejection of higher prices. As a result, the price broke below the SMA.\nIf the SMA holds as resistance, bears will get a chance to target the 0.6550 support level. At the same time, the price might start making lower highs and lows. On the other hand, if bulls break back above the SMA, the price will likely challenge the 0.6700 resistance for a new high.\nLooking to trade forex now?

The Fed lowered rates to 4.00%\u20134.25% and signaled two more cuts before year-end, with Chair Powell emphasizing labor market weakness but leaving inflation forecasts at 3.1% for 2025. The dollar briefly spiked before settling, as investors recalibrated expectations. Across the Pacific, the BoJ is expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.50%, holding its cautious line despite inflation still running above wage growth. The divergence between the Fed\u2019s easing path and Japan\u2019s tentative tightening outlook has kept the pair in a narrow but tense trading band.\nPolitical Instability and Trade Deals Shape Yen Outlook\nJapan\u2019s political backdrop adds complexity, with the Prime Minister stepping down and elections set for October 4. This leadership vacuum discourages aggressive BoJ action. At the same time, a new U.S.-Japan trade deal reassures policymakers that tariffs won\u2019t immediately push Japan into recession, giving the BoJ more room to wait. Market pricing reflects this: traders assign roughly 50% odds of a 25 bps hike by March 2026, with gradual tightening expected over the next 18 months.

The 146.25 level has been tested repeatedly, with sellers pressing for a break lower. A decisive close under this level would expose 145.00 and then 143.30 as downside targets. On the upside, the 50-day moving average at 147.67 and the 200-day at 148.62 cap near-term rallies. A breakout above 148.60 would re-open the path toward 150.00 and possibly 150.77, the summer high.

With the Fed signaling 50 bps of cuts by December and the BoJ likely holding or hiking modestly, medium-term pressures tilt against the dollar. That said, the yen\u2019s traditional safe-haven status has been muted by Japan\u2019s ultra-low yields and ongoing QE unwind. Hedge funds remain net long USD/JPY, reflecting carry trade support, but positioning leaves the market vulnerable to sharp reversals if U.S. data underperforms.\nMarket Positioning and Short-Term Catalysts\nSpeculators remain cautious, with many betting that USD/JPY holds within 146.30\u2013147.35 near term. U.S. jobless claims, upcoming Japanese CPI data, and Ueda\u2019s press conference will dictate direction. Should U.S. labor softness accelerate, the dollar leg of the pair weakens. Conversely, any delay in BoJ hikes prolongs yen underperformance, encouraging a retest of 148.60\u2013150.00.\nVerdict on USD/JPY\nAt current levels near 146.80, USD/JPY is range-bound but leaning toward a bearish bias over the next 3\u20136 months. The combination of Fed easing and possible BoJ tightening by early 2026 suggests the yen will gradually strengthen. Fo"

The US Dollar (USD) strengthens against the Japanese Yen (JPY) after the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered an expected rate cut but signaled no rush to lower borrowing costs quickly in the coming months. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) interest rate decision will take center stage later on Friday.\nThe US central bank on Wednesday decided to cut the interest rate by a quarter-point and signaled that two more reductions are on the way before the end of the year as worries intensified over the US labor market, even as inflation is still in the air. The decision puts the overnight funds rate in a range between 4.00%-4.25%.\n\u201cA majority of the FOMC is now targeting two further cuts this year, indicating that the doves on the committee are now in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nThe BoJ is broadly anticipated to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at around 0.50% at a two-day meeting ending on Friday. The Japanese central bank has kept rates on hold for the fourth consecutive meeting, citing uncertainty about how US import tariffs will affect Japan's economy.\nTraders will take more cues from the speech from the BoJ Governor Ueda Kazuo after the policy meeting, which might offer some hints about the economic outlook for Japan. Any hawkish remarks from the BoJ policymakers could lift the JPY and create a headwind for the pair. According to a Reuters poll, a majority of economists expect another 25 basis points (bps) hike by year-end. But those surveyed were split on the timing, with bets centring on October and January.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "Canadian Dollar, USD/CAD Talking Points:\n- USD/CAD has bounced from the support zone of 1.3750, keeping the door open for bulls and as looked at in the Tuesday webinar, the pair can remain an attractive point for traders looking at larger themes of USD-strength.\n- Both the Fed and BoC cut rates yesterday but perhaps more impactful was the Fed\u2019s projections, which were less dovish for next year than what markets were looking for ahead of the announcement. That\u2019s helped to bring on USD-strength in the aftermath of the rate decision, with a continuation of the rally in DXY showing after release of this morning\u2019s jobless claims data.\n- I\u2019ll be looking into USD/CAD in the weekly webinar, and you\u2019re welcome to join the next. Click here to register.\nIt\u2019s been a bullish reaction in the USD to yesterday\u2019s rate cut from the Fed, and this bears some resemblance to last year, when the currency initially pressed into a fresh yearly low on news of the cut, only to rally during the press conference. For last year\u2019s scenario, however, the currency remained near those lows for about two weeks before ultimately reversing and that USD rally ran through Q4 trade and into the 2025 open.\nFor the current instance, USD-strength has shown a bit more prominently with another push-higher this morning after the release of jobless claims data. And this has helped to further the recovery in USD/CAD following the pullback that ran into the start of this week.\nI looked into the pair in the Tuesday webinar, highlighting that support test as it was taking place at a key zone. The 1.3750 area was resistance in June and July after showing as support in May; and more recently, it\u2019s been in as support following the break of an ascending triangle formation. The item focused on was where exactly bulls would show up to hold the lows, and whether that took place above the prior higher-low that had printed in late-August of 1.3626(7). Well, so far that higher low has held at 1.3626(8), or one-tenth of a pip above the prior higher-low, which shows some element of bullish anticipation remaining in the pair that has, so far, led to a rally back above the bigger picture support zone.\nUSD/CAD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/CAD Structure\nDespite the fresh three-year-low that printed in the USD briefly after the announcement of yesterday\u2019s rate cut, USD/CAD continues to hold bullish structure as shown from the support zone taken from prior resistance, along with the shorter-term observation above of a higher-low holding above the prior test of that support zone.\nThis sets USD/CAD up as one of the more attractive major pairs for traders looking for USD-strength, and conversely, for those trying to avoid the USD, the Canadian Dollar weakness shown over the past couple of months could potentially be used elsewhere, in a pair with a relatively strong currency such as EUR/CAD or GBP/CAD.\nIn USD/CAD, the spot that bulls need to take out to illustrate greater control than simply a stall in the broader sell-off is the 1.3900 zone, which has held resistance twice over the past month, most recently last Thursday. Above that is a contentious zone, the same that was setting resistance back in May at the 1.4000 handle.\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/CAD Bigger Picture\nI think the bigger picture look in USD/CAD is worth of mention here, as it helps to highlight where exactly the pair is in terms of the broader sell-off that took over in the first half of this year. At this point, the 23.% retracement of that move has continued to show as short-term resistance, and this highlights how a larger move of USD-strength could carry significant potential should the recovery in the pair continue.\nThe 38.2% retracement of that move aligns with the swing-high from May, which is also around that 1.4000 spot that saw ardent defense from sellers. And then above that, the 50% mark of this year\u2019s se"

Policymakers signaled they were open to easing further, noting that inflationary pressure had eased to a degree.\nThe bigger jolt came from the Fed. A 25 bp rate cut knocked USDCAD down to 1.3727, but the dip didn\u2019t last\u2014within moments it was back near 1.3765 as traders realized the Fed wasn\u2019t nearly dovish as they had hoped.\nWTI crude churned sideways between 63.45 and 64.26, with the latest Fed move keeping a lid on gains. Prices look locked in a broader 62.00\u201366.00 corridor, where worries about war-related supply shocks are balanced by rising Opec output.\nThe Fed didn\u2019t live up to the hype. Instead of a sweeping dovish turn, it offered what Powell called a \u201crisk management cut,\u201d stressing that any further moves would be made one meeting at a time. Nine of nineteen policymakers still pencil in two more rate cuts this year, but the mixed message didn\u2019t inspire markets. The initial knee-jerk dovish reaction evaporated, leaving Wall Street flat, the US dollar uneven, and 10-year Treasury yields bouncing back to 4.096% from a dip to 3.99%.\nAsian trading was a choppy affair. Japan\u2019s Topix managed a 0.41% gain, while Australia\u2019s ASX 200 slid 0.83% on the back of weak jobs data. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1.35%. European bourses were more upbeat by early New York hours, with the DAX up 1.16%, the CAC 40 climbing 1.10%, and the FTSE 100 eking out a 0.17% rise.\nUS futures found some fuel, advancing 0.77% on optimism after Nvidia pledged a $5 billion investment in Intel. The dollar index sat at 96.91, gold traded at 3667.96, and 10-year Treasury yields hovered near 4.052%.\nEURUSD chopped between 1.1780 and 1.1849 overnight and is testing the top of that range as New York gets underway. The gains come despite labour unrest in France where teachers, health workers, and rail staff are striking against austerity measures.\nGBPUSD pushed up from 1.3586 in Asia to 1.3661 in New York before easing to 1.3646 after the Bank of England left rates unchanged at 4.0% and slowed the pace of its balance-sheet reduction.\nUSDJPY climbed within a 146.77-147.53 range, clawing back most of the week\u2019s earlier losses. Yesterday\u2019s dip to 145.50 was quickly reversed in a classic \u201csell the rumour, buy the fact\u201d move after the Fed failed to deliver a dovish surprise. Weaker August Machinery Orders added no help. Traders now wait for the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision tomorrow.\nAUDUSD dropped after soft employment data, sliding to 0.6616 from 0.6605, but the dip was short-lived and the pair rebounded to 0.6659 in New York. Australia shed 5,400 jobs, though the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.\nToday\u2019s US releases feature weekly jobless claims, expected at 240,000 after last week\u2019s 263,000, and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey, forecast at 2.3 after printing \u20130.3 in August."

                "body": "- USD/CAD flat lines near 1.3800 in Friday\u2019s early European session.\n- The Fed cut the rates but signaled little urgency to lower borrowing costs quickly in the coming months.\n- The Canadian July Retail Sales report will be in the spotlight later on Friday.\nThe USD/CAD pair trades on a flat note around 1.3800 during the early European trading hours on Friday. The US Dollar (USD) might receive some support from a less dovish than expected stance from the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Traders await the Canadian Retail Sales data for July for fresh impetus, which is due later on Friday.\nThe Fed decided to cut the interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) and signaled two more reductions by the end of this year at its September meeting. This is the Fed's first reduction this year and puts the target range for its main lending rate at 4.0% - 4.25%.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the latest move to lower interest rates was a risk management cut, adding that he doesn't feel the need to move quickly on rates. A less dovish stance from the US central bank provides some support to the Greenback in the near term.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) surprised markets by cutting its key rate to a three-year low of 2.5% at its meeting on Wednesday, while signaling it could ease further if needed. The divergence in interest rate paths from the BoC and the US Fed could exert some selling pressure on the Loonie as the US central bank offered a far less dovish message after its first rate cut of the year.\nMeanwhile, a rise in crude oil prices might lift the commodity-linked Loonie and create a headwind for the pair. It\u2019s worth noting that Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US, and higher crude oil prices tend to have a positive impact on the CAD value.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

The downward trajectory drags spot prices to the lower end of the weekly range, around the 199.50 area, and is exclusively sponsored by a strong pickup in demand for the Japanese Yen (JPY).\nAs was anticipated, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to leave the short-term interest rate target unchanged in the range of 0.4%- 0.5% at the conclusion of a two-day monetary policy review meeting this Friday. However, there were two dissents to the on-hold decision, both wanting a rate hike, which, in turn, provides a goodish intraday boost to the JPY and exerts downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nFurthermore, investors have been pricing in the possibility of a 25-basis-point (bps) BoJ rate hike move in October amid signs of economic resilience. This marks a big divergence in comparison to the Bank of England's (BoE) dovish signal that there will be further reductions in the bank rate, which contributes to the JPY's outperformance against its British counterpart and weighs on the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe JPY bulls, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets amid concerns that domestic political uncertainty could give BoJ reasons to further delay rate hikes. Adding to this, data released earlier today showed that Japan's core consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in nine months during August. Hence, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's remarks should provide a fresh impetus to the GBP/JPY cross.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoJ Press Conference\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) holds a press conference at the end of each one of its eight scheduled policy meetings. At the press conference the Governor of the BoJ communicates with media representatives and investors regarding monetary policy. The Governor talks about the factors that affect the most recent interest rate decision, the overall economic outlook, inflation, and clues regarding future monetary policy. Hawkish comments tend to boost the Japanese Yen (JPY), while a dovish message tends to weaken it.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Sep 19, 2025 06:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: -\nSource: Bank of Japan\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Click here to register.\nThe Fed cut rates and warned of another 50 bps of cuts for this year and another 25 for next year, yet the US Dollar has rallied over the past two days and is now threatening a larger reversal formation on the weekly chart. DXY is holding resistance at a big spot, from the longer-term trendline that\u2019s held support for the past month; but if we do see USD bulls push into the end of the week, forming a hammer on the weekly chart, the premise of bullish reversals will start to look much more attractive. Key for whether this happens will be the Bank of Japan meeting later tonight.\nUS Dollar Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY\nWhile the USD touched a fresh three-year low at yesterday\u2019s rate decision before beginning the rally, USD/JPY has largely held well-above its April low of 140 and July low just inside of 142. Support yesterday showed right around the bullish trendline produced by this year\u2019s higher-lows which is confluent with the 145.86 level looked at in the Tuesday webinar.\nThe fact that USD/JPY has been largely flat over the past six weeks even as DXY has melted down elsewhere, against the Euro and British Pound, highlights the deduction of Yen-weakness, which has been more attractive elsewhere in pairs such as EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY. That may remain the case as of right now, although if we get a similar reaction in USD/JPY as what showed around the last BoJ meeting, that could begin to shift.\nIt was the FOMC and BoJ meetings in late-July that led into breakout in USD/JPY. With rate cut bets being priced-out after the Fed, USD/JPY shorts were squeezed, with another gust of rally showing around the Bank of Japan meeting later that night. This allowed for a break of 150.00 in USD/JPY, and eventually a resistance test at 150.77 which was looked at in these articles. As I warned then, this was a tough move to chase and that proved to be the case when we saw a vicious reversal on that Fridy after the release of Non-farm Payrolls.\nAs we traded into August, with the USD continuing to head lower on the back of weakness in the labor market, USD/JPY held a flat, horizontal range, and this again illustrates that deduction of Yen-weakness.\nIn USD/JPY, there\u2019s now an open door for bulls and if they do push through, which could allow for the bullish scenario in USD to brighten, opening the door to larger reversal potential in DXY. But, until that breakout shows, JPY-weakness may simply be more attractive elsewhere, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few months.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nThe main complication with EUR/JPY is historical in nature, and that\u2019s a dearth of history above the 175.00 level. To this point there has been one single daily close in the pair above that price \u2013 and it was the day before the pair went into a 2000 pip reversal.\nAs chronicled in these pieces even going back to the July BoJ meeting, bulls have very much remained in control here and there\u2019s still no evidence of that changing. But \u2013 the episode at 170.00 also highlights how impactful these round levels can be and if we do see buyers stretch up for a test of 175.00 before pulling back, there could be a case to be made for short-term reversal setups.\nAs for trends, bulls are still in order and the ascending triangle that\u2019s built ove"

                "body": "Key Takeaways\n- The SEC has approved general listing standards for crypto ETFs.\n- The new framework is expected to lead to an explosion in crypto ETF listings in the coming weeks and months.\n- Under the new framework, crypto ETFs can be fast-tracked if the underlying crypto asset has had a futures market on a regulated exchange for at least six months and meets other standards.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has paved the way for a flurry of new crypto-related exchange-traded funds.\nThe SEC late Wednesday announced that it approved generic listing standards for commodity-based exchange-traded products, fast-tracking the approval for crypto funds.1 By approving the standards across Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca, the SEC has eliminated the need for individual approvals under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nPrior to the new guidance, spot crypto fund issuers were subject to a lengthy application process that required public comment and SEC review, which is why most of the crypto ETFs that have launched to date covered bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\nThe streamlined approach is expected to shorten launch timelines, cut administrative costs, and and make more cryptocurrencies available to investors in an ETF wrapper. The new standards came with the approval of the first multi-crypto asset ETF in the U.S., the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, or GLDC, which in addition to crypto and ether holds XRP, solana and cardano.2\nWhy This Matters to You\nInvestors will likely see a tidal wave of new crypto ETF launches starting in October, with all manner of digital assets that have never before landed in an investment vehicle. Think memecoin ETFs that hold doge and trump, and multi-crypto asset funds aimed at delivering on a theme like tokenization.\nThe main listing criteria for a crypto ETF will be the existence of a futures market for the underlying asset on a regulated exchange, such as Coinbase, for a period of at least six months, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart.3 Crypto ETF offerings that fall outside the framework can still go through the traditional approval process via individual filings.\nThe latest changes are seen by the crypto industry as a step forward for continued regulatory clarity on crypto from the SEC and the Trump administration. They remove a boundary between firms seeking to put a range of crypto assets into a new product and investors who might be interested in such products.\nThe mass approval of pending crypto ETF applications had been predicted by Seyffart and other experts. \"We're gonna be off to the races in a matter of weeks,\" Seyffart posted on X following the SEC approval of the new framework.4\nRelated Education\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan noted that there was a massive increase in ETF listings when generic listing standards were created for traditional ETFs in the past. \"The pace of ETF launches rose from ~117/year to ~370/year,\" he posted on X.5\nDigital assets platform and services provider Galaxy says 10 tokens currently meet the criteria for an expedited listing: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Chainlink, Stellar, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Polkadot and Hedera. (A dogecoin ETF launched today.) ADA and XRP will also qualify shortly, according to Galaxy.6 Several applications to launch ETFs holding those coins have already been submitted to the SEC.\nThe SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs in Jan. 2024, more than 10 years after Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss first submitted an application for one. Ether ETFs were approved that July. Bitcoin ETFs have about $150 billion in assets under management, while ether ETFs have just under $30 billion."

The fund offers exposure to five major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) through traditional market channels.\nThe approval utilizes new generic listing standards designed to accelerate crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) reviews across Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges. This streamlined process eliminates individual application assessments, significantly speeding approval timelines for future products.\nCEO Peter Mintzberg announced the approval, thanking the SEC Crypto Task Force for regulatory clarity efforts.\nThe fund currently holds over $915 million in assets under management with a $57.7 net asset value per share. This substantial size demonstrates existing investor appetite for multi-asset cryptocurrency products within traditional investment frameworks.\nThe Future of Crypto ETFs\nThe SEC Crypto Task Force, established by acting Chair Mark Uyeda under Commissioner Hester Peirce's leadership, represents a significant shift from previous enforcement-heavy approaches. The task force focuses on developing clear regulatory frameworks rather than pursuing litigation strategies.\nBloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas predicts over 100 crypto ETFs could launch within 12 months following generic listing standards implementation. Previous ETF category implementations showed tripling of product launches, suggesting massive expansion potential.\nThe approval coincides with growing expectations for altseason, where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform BTC. Coinbase predicted full-scale altcoin season beginning in September based on historical chart patterns and market conditions.\nChair Paul Atkins emphasized maximizing investor choice and fostering innovation through streamlined listing processes. The development reduces barriers to digital asset access within America's trusted capital markets, potentially attracting billions in new institutional investment.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

The launch of this fund on Wall Street can lead to strong institutional interest. Speaking on the development, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintberg said:\n\u201cGrayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards. The Grayscale team is working expeditiously to bring the *FIRST* multi crypto asset ETP to market with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.\u201d\nBitcoin accounts for more than 72% of the fund\u2019s portfolio, followed by Ethereum at over 17%. XRP, Solana, and Cardano carry allocations of 5.62%, 4.03%, and 1%, respectively. Grayscale recently trimmed its BTC weighting to boost exposure to the other assets.\nETF specialist Nate Geraci credited Grayscale for paving the way for crypto ETFs through its legal challenge against the SEC. He added that the approval of the large-cap fund GDLC could open the gates for multi-asset crypto ETFs, from other asset managers.\nEarlier this year, in July, the US securities regulator postponed its decision on Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert the Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) from an over-the-counter product into an exchange-listed ETP on NYSE Arca, citing the need for additional review.\nWith the Generic Listing Standards now in place, the process is expected to be more streamlined. It potentially paves the way for additional crypto ETPs.\nGrayscale Pushes for Spot ETFs for LINK, AVAX, ADA\nDigital asset manager Grayscale has been pushing to bring different crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Its recent application targets some of the emerging crypto assets like Chainlink , Avalanche , and Cardano .\nGrayscale has filed a Form S-1 to convert its Chainlink Trust (LINK) into an exchange-traded fund, the Grayscale Chainlink Trust ETF, which is expected to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GLNK.\nRead original story Grayscale's Crypto Large Cap Fund, Including BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, Gets SEC Approval by Bhushan Akolkar at Coinspeaker.com"

Arkham noted that if confirmed, Grayscale would be the first US Ethereum ETF sponsor to stake its holdings.\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) manages more than 1.06 million ETH, valued at over $4.8 billion. The firm launched ETHE in 2017 as a private placement vehicle, and in 2024 rolled out the lower-cost Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) through a partial spin-off of ETHE\u2019s assets.\nThe development follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision this year to delay rulings on whether Grayscale funds could incorporate ETH staking. Since then, the regualtor has provided additional clarity, indicating that some forms of liquid staking may not fall under its jurisdiction \u2014 opening the door to potential adoption by regulated funds.\nAlthough Grayscale has filed proposals to enable staking, the SEC has yet to approve them \u2014 indicating the company may be positioning ahead of a ruling. No existing spot Ether ETFs include staking features.\nThe Arkham-tracked transfer came a day after the SEC approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund \u2014 a multi-asset crypto ETP offering exposure to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).

                "body": "Galaxy Digital\u2019s $306 million purchase of Solana (SOL) has once again reminded the market that institutions are willing to place large bets on established cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates the trust that big capital has in major assets. But while headlines focus on these giant moves, larger whales often look in another direction for asymmetric upside. Their strategy is diversification into smaller-cap projects with strong mechanics, and this is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly becoming a top target. With analysts projecting $2 per token, whales recognize the opportunity for exponential gains compared to the modest upside of major caps like SOL.\nGalaxy Digital Buys $306M in SOL\nGalaxy Digital, a leading digital asset investment firm, purchased $306 million worth of Solana (SOL) in a single day on September 14, 2025, acquiring 1.2 million SOL tokens from exchanges like Binance and Coinbase before transferring them to Fireblocks for custody. This move extends a buying spree that began midweek, totaling over $1.55 billion in SOL acquisitions across 6.5 million tokens in five days.\nThe activity coincides with Galaxy\u2019s partnership with Multicoin Capital and Jump Crypto for a crypto treasury venture, including a $1.65 billion private placement in Forward Industries, which is pivoting to become a major Solana treasury holder. SOL surged 2.3% to ~$200, with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.6 billion. Technical indicators show SOL breaking $188 resistance, with RSI at 66 and support at $185. Social media reflects excitement over institutional adoption, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. Analysts project a $225 target if $211 clears.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM): Why Whales Favor Utility-First Projects\nInstitutional investors and high-net-worth players do not chase trends. Instead, they prioritize risk-managed mechanics and utility that ensure demand will grow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been designed from the ground up with exactly these priorities in mind.\nOne of the first advantages is its structured liquidation system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)\u2019s rules ensure that when loans fall below safety levels, collateral is liquidated in a liquidity-aware way. This protects the platform against shocks and keeps revenue flowing to the treasury. For whales, such built-in safety nets make MUTM a viable long-term crypto investment rather than a speculative gamble.\nThe protocol also introduces borrowing and deposit caps. By restricting collateral types and setting system-wide limits, the platform reduces systemic risks while keeping borrowing efficient. This makes it attractive for both retail and institutional users who want assurance that runaway activity cannot destabilize the ecosystem.\nReliable oracles further strengthen the protocol. By relying on Chainlink as a primary feed and supplementing with fallback references, MUTM ensures accurate valuations and minimizes manipulation risk. For whales managing large positions, this trust in data feeds is crucial.\nThis combination of liquidation rules, caps, and oracles sets MUTM apart from meme-driven assets and gives it the profile of a project that can sustain high levels of borrowing, lending, and user adoption over time. Investors looking at crypto charts can already see how tokens with utility-first structures tend to outperform those built only on hype.\nThe presale has become the proving ground of this growing attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, with $15.90 million raised, more than 16,400 holders onboard, and 42% of tokens sold. The current entry price is $0.035, with Phase 7 coming soon at $0.040, representing a 15% increase. With whale wallets already beginning to accumulate, this window represents the last discounted stage before momentum accelerates. The project\u2019s credibility is further strengthened by its CertiK audit, scoring 90 on Token Scan and 79 on Skynet, offering another layer of trust for serious investors wondering is crypto a good investment in today\u2019s marke"

The S&P 500 was up 27.25 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 6,627.6, the Dow Jones industrial was up 10.44 points, or 0.02 per cent, at 46,028.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 170.59 points, or 0.77 per cent, at 22,431.92.\nIntel\u2019s shares were up 23.65 per cent to $30.79 after the news that Nvidia is going to take a $5 billion stake in the company, while Nvidia\u2019s shares were up 2.94 per cent to $175.3.\nMarkets steady after Bank\u2019s rates decision\nBoth the FTSE 100 and the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 remained largely unmoved by the Bank\u2019s well-trailed decision to hold rates. The FTSE 100 was up 14.6 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 9,222.97 while the FTSE 250 was up 48.51 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 21,668.32.\nThe pound slipped against the dollar, falling 0.28 per cent to $1.36.\nEx-IoD boss disqualified for suspected Covid loan abuse\nA former director of the Institute of Directors, who was last year shortlisted for a prestigious businesswoman of the year award, has been disqualified as a company director until 2036 for suspected Covid loan abuse, the Insolvency Service said.\nAnna Daroy, who was interim chief operating officer and later interim director general of the Institute of Directors from October 2018 to November 2019, was banned as a director for 11 years earlier this month.\nDaroy, 61, secured two maximum-value \u00a350,000 Bounce Back Loans (BBLs) from separate banks for her management consultancy Globepoint Associates six months after leaving her role at the IoD. The rules of the scheme meant that companies were only entitled to one loan.\nInterest rate cuts? Soon but not yet\nThe decision by the Bank to hold the base rate at 4 per cent was widely expected, but economists are divided over when they will next be cut.\nYael Selfin, at KPMG UK: \u201cThe labour market has continued to cool, but evidence of deterioration has become less apparent, weakening the case for further policy easing. Meanwhile, inflation is set to rise further in the near term. The less favourable backdrop has seen the odds shift against further interest rate cuts this year. But we expect a small majority on the MPC to vote for a cut in November, leaving interest rates at 3.75 per cent by the end of 2025.\u201d\nJanet Mui, at RBC Brewin Dolphin: \u201cUnlike the Fed, which has shifted focus on the labour market, the Bank of England (BoE) does not have the luxury to ease policy in the face of a weakening economy. Even as the UK economy cools, inflation is not backing down as hoped, which leaves the BoE stuck. Ongoing tight monetary conditions may risk deeper economic weakness in 2026 and beyond, which could eventually curb inflation and justify rate cuts, but not yet.\u201d\nPaul Dales, Capital Economics: \u201cWe continue to think the Bank won\u2019t cut rates again until February. The repetition of the phrase that \u2018a gradual and careful\u2019 approach to rate cuts is appropriate suggests the Bank still thinks interest rates will fall further. But our sense is that the Bank decides it\u2019s safer to slow the pace of rate cuts from 25bps per quarter by keeping rates on hold at the next two meetings (November and December).\u201d\nEd Monk, Fidelity International: \u201cThe gilt market is indicating that no further rate cuts are likely this year, with the MPC meeting in March 2026 currently looking most likely to bring the next reduction. That was not part of the plan for households who have been hanging on under the pressure of higher borrowing costs. The Treasury would like monetary policy to be aiding its push for growth but the reality is that it is likely to remain restrictive for some time to come.\u201d\nNvidia takes $5 billion stake in rival Intel\nNvidia has announced it will invest $5 billion in troubled rival US chipmaker Intel, in which the US government recently took a stake.\nThe deal includes a plan for Intel and Nvidia to jointly develop PC and data centre chips, representing "

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, moved up 0.3%.\nAll three major averages clinched record closes. The small-cap index Russell 2000 (^RUT) also climbed more than 2% to notch a new all-time high close.\n(^GSPC)\nShares in Intel surged 23% as investors welcomed Nvidia's $5 billion investment in the struggling US chipmaker.\nMore broadly, markets are shaking off initial hesitation that dragged on stocks after the Fed reduced rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday. While the Fed's \"dot plot\" signaled that two more cuts are likely in 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comment that high inflation and a weak labor market leave \"no risk-free path\" dented confidence.\nWeekly jobless claims figures out on Thursday showed further signs of labor market stress.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index recorded its first record close since November 2021 on Thursday.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, was at 4.11%, up from 4.09% at Wednesday's close.\nGold futures were 1% lower at around $3,680 an ounce at 4 p.m. ET. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down 0.6% at roughly $63.70 a barrel. Bitcoin rose about 1.5% to roughly $117,500. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, rose 0.5% to 97.37 after hitting its lowest level since early 2022 yesterday.\nIntel (INTC) shares soared nearly 23%, pacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, after Nvidia (NVDA) said it would invest $5 billion into its struggling rival chipmaker to co-develop data centers and PC products. Nvidia stock gained 3.5% and was one of the top performers in the Dow.\nAlso in corporate news, cybersecurity firm Netskope shares ended 18% higher in their Nasdaq debut, while StubHub (STUB) stock fell a further 7% after dropping more than 6% in their debut yesterday.\nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nAdvancers\n- Nvidia (NVDA) said it would invest $5 billion in semiconductor industry peer Intel (INTC) and that the two companies will collaborate on cutting-edge chips for computers and data centers. The vote of confidence from Nvidia came just a few weeks after Intel agreed to a deal giving the U.S. government a 10% stake in the company. Intel shares skyrocketed 23% on Thursday, outpacing all other stocks in the S&P 500, while Nvidia stock was up 3.5%.\n- Shares of Intel partner Synopsys (SNPS), a provider of electronic design automation software used in the chipmaking process, jumped 13%. The potential for increased demand from a major customer helped Synopsys stock regain some ground after a major move lower last week, when the company reported lower-than-expected revenue and adjusted profit results and slashed its full-year outlook.\n- CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares surged 13% after the cybersecurity firm offered an improved outlook for annual recurring revenue. In the summer of 2024, CrowdStrike stock plunged and sales growth came under pressure in the wake of a widespread technology outage tied to a faulty software update, but the company has staged a recovery over the past year.\nDecliners\n- The steepest decline in the S&P 500 on Thursday belonged to shares of financial data and software provider FactSet Research Systems (FDS), which tumbled more than 10%. The company's quarterly adjusted earnings per share and profit forecast for fiscal 2026 came in below consensus estimates. Increased technology expenses weighed on FactSet's adjusted operating margin, which slipped year-over-year.\n- Darden Restaurants (DRI) also reported lower-than-expected quarterly profits, and its shares lost 7.7%. While same-store sales growth from its Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse helped Darden match revenue estimates, the company reported declines in its fine-dining business. The company cautioned that high food and labor costs could weigh on future earnings as it aims to maintain lower prices.\n- Nucor (NUE) shares fell 6% after the steelmaker provided lower-than-expected profit guidance for the third quarter. The company pointed to pressure in all its key segments, with volume declines affecting its steel mills, increased cost per ton weighing on its steel products business, and profitability issues with scrap operations dragging on the raw materials segment.\nA Wave of Crypto ETFs Are "

It is only myself and eight other attendees\u2014 our guide has left the tent. Though earlier we could hear tension-rattling music setting a cryptic mood, now there is nothing. Lights? Off. The tent has gone pitch black. At this particular moment, there\u2019s only the sound of our breaths, our thoughts and perhaps some new guests.\nWelcome to \u201cPhasmagorica,\u201d what composer-turned-magician-turned-spiritual explorer BC Smith describes as \u201ca s\u00e9ance reimagined as art.\u201d It\u2019s running this month at the Heritage Square Museum, itself a location imbued with history and mystery, the site of the homes of Los Angeles as they existed a century ago.\nI\u2019ll get right to the point: I did not have an encounter with the dead. And yet I left \u201cPhasmagorica\u201d deeply curious. That\u2019s because Smith sets up the evening as an exploration of the modern Western history of communing with the deceased, attempting to conjure the feeling of a s\u00e9ance as it occurred in late 1880s America, albeit with a better sound system and all the Death in the Afternoon cocktails you can consume (note: you should not consume very many).\nThe \u201cexperiment\u201d \u2014 Smith shirks at the word performance \u2014 is designed, he says, for believers and nonbelievers. He himself falls somewhere in the middle.\n\u201cI\u2019m a hopeful skeptic,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIf I were a 100% believer, \u2018Phasmagorica\u2019 would be a church. I just wanted to create a space that started a conversation for people.\u201d\n\u201cThe Cort\u00e8ge,\u201d running this September at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, revives an ancient art \u2014 the procession \u2014 turning it into a communal release of grief.\nIt is relevant to point out that Smith is also a magician, a member of the Magic Castle, home itself to a popular s\u00e9ance. While Smith has not conducted a Magic Castle s\u00e9ance, he has \u2014 and will \u2014 orchestrate what he refers to as a \u201ctheatrical s\u00e9ance,\u201d for which he is present as a storyteller. \u201cPhasmagorica\u201d is different, Smith says, and was born out of those more dramatic performances, in part because he kept encountering the unaccountable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly curated,\u201d Smith says of a core difference between a theatrical s\u00e9ance and \u201cPhasmagorica,\u201d as the former will be tailored specifically to guest needs and requests. \u201cBut people were experiencing a lot in those s\u00e9ances that I could not explain,\u201d Smith says. He recites a story that opens \u201cPhasmagorica\u201d of a shadow reaching out and touching someone on a shoulder. Smith says he witnessed this phenomena, and at that point decided to create an event that focused on realism and dispensed with the notion that there could be any illusions or magic.\nI was surprised, for instance, when Smith left the room. At that point, we were with only a television, which narrates a short history of s\u00e9ances in America before instructing us to hold a pendulum over a spirit board. Knowing Smith\u2019s past, I went in expecting more of a show. Instead, we are prodded to examine a tarot card, peer into the scrying mirror and ask questions to our spirit board.\n\u201cIt becomes more personal,\u201d Smith says. \u201cEven in my theatrical s\u00e9ances, I\u2019ve had people want to cut me off mid-sentence and say, \u2018This just happened to me.\u2019 And they want to spend the next five minutes talking about it. At the end of the day, I think what people like is that this is all about them.\u201d\nAnd still, Smith says, audiences are looking for wizardry. But there\u2019s no tricks of the light, no hidden fans. He stresses multiple times in this interview and at the start of \u201cPhasmagorica\u201d that this is \u201cnot theater, not a performance, not a show.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people walk out of the r"

Headline inflation in the country also dropped to 2.7%, coming down from 3.1% in July and marking a fresh low since November 2024.\n\"The Bank of Japan's decision to hold rates steady underscores its cautious stance amid slowing inflation and global uncertainty \u2013 prioritizing stability over premature tightening,\" said Hiroaki Amemiya, investment director at Capital Group. \"By preserving policy optionality, the BoJ is signaling its readiness to respond to external volatility while continuing to assess the strength of Japan's economic recovery.\"\n\"The BoJ's strategy supports the early stages of a reflationary cycle, rather than reversing course,\" Amemiya added.\nYields on Japan's 2-year government bonds rose to 0.885%, marking the highest since June 2008, LSEG data showed.\nMeanwhile, the Topix added 0.84%.\nAustralia's ASX/S&P 200 climbed 0.77%.

Adani's flagship Adani Enterprises jumped over 4% after India's market watchdog absolved Adani Group and its founder Gautam Adani of certain misconduct allegations made by Hindenburg Research.\nOvernight in the U.S., the major averages closed higher with smaller equities seeing the biggest boost, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was embarking on an easing rate path, reinvigorating investors and raising hopes for a ratcheting up of economic growth.\nThe S&P 500 closed up 0.48% at 6,631.96, while the Nasdaq Composite popped 0.94% to settle at 22,470.73.
