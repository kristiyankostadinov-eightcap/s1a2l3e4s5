                "body": "Tesla misses Q4 delivery estimates\n2025 Was a Bad One in Many Ways Except Investment (IMO and Speaking Personally)\nA silver (and gold) lining was, of course, the precious metals sector for we who had anticipated the bull. Gold led, the rest of the precious metals complex, and eventually broader markets, followed.\n2026? It Can\u2019t Get Any Worse Socio-Politically, and Pending a Potential Q1/H1 Liquidity Issue, Could Be Just as Good Investment-Wise\nWith the Fed already on a rate-cutting regimen and positioned for some form of QE (as it plans to buy short-term Treasuries and let MBS roll off the books), and Trump soon to tap a yes-man to chair the Fed, the inflation problem they appear to want to summon should lift a wider segment of the broad commodity and resources sectors.\nCyclical Inflation or Stagflation?\nThe above would assume either no recession in 2026 or a quick one (in line with our \u201cinterim liquidity event\u201d theory that could come at the hands of a Yen Carry implosion and/or a counter-trend USD rally and/or rebound in the Gold/Silver ratio) that would actually give license to the Trump administration to go balls out inflationary in its fiscal policies.\nThey\u2019ve already proven not to be inflation fighters, and I am not talking about tariffs. I am talking about a man badgering the Fed chief to cut rates (i.e. increase inflationary inputs), seemingly since time immemorial. I am talking about certain aspects of the big, beautiful spending bill.\nWith these inputs set in stone, 2026 looks to either feature cyclical inflation (inflation that works to keep the economy in growth mode) as in Q3, 2020 forward, or Stagflation, which would see a struggling economy, but higher prices of important goods and some services. I lean \u201cStag\u201d.\nThere are no more important \u201cgoods\u201d than the critical minerals and materials that bulled in 2025, amid global trade tensions and related asset grabs. This is especially so with the expansion of AI (it\u2019s a bubble in many respects, but it is also real) and all those data centers being built to support it.\nPrecious Metals; Gold, Then Silver\nGold led the 2025 festivities, breaking upward in January after a 2.5-month-long consolidation. In the spring, as silver was blowing off to the downside in relation to gold, we anticipated a reversal to the upside. And boy did we get one!\nIt was gold, then the gold miners and then finally, silver. After first identifying a condition for a big upside reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio, here is the \u201cSilver/Gold ratio\u201d portion of one update on the precious metals from May, 2025.\nThe Silver/Gold ratio remains a stick in the mud. Of course, unlike many, we did not need silver to be strong to be bullish on gold stocks and the precious metals complex. However, my gut thinks that a final upside show could be put on with silver leading. Thus far, that is a non-starter.\nWell, it started alright. And it went further than I\u2019d originally anticipated. Because of course it did! Markets often move with more momentum than originally pre-planned. That goes double for the silver price.\nFast forward to today, a day after CME Group predictably raised margin requirements on silver and gold (again), after the hype, leverage and momentum built up in the silver price, right into year-end.\nThe Silver/Gold ratio is doing this (because of course it is!). It\u2019s a little different than those fore-thinking days when we were projecting the play last spring (ref. green box below).\nDespite positive macro-fundamentals, the short-term is subject to volatility and folks, if you believe that a vast majority of those in the silver market \u2013 despite physical holders/stackers \u2013 are healthy participants, you might want to think again. No market goes this hard for this long without attracting MOMOs, FOMOs and player of all kinds.\nThe 2025 precious metals story is typical, in that it was led by gold, then the miners kicked in, and then silver took over and cleared the tracks for a major run, fueled by momentum and FOMO"

                "body": "As the calendar turns to January 2, 2026, the global financial markets are grappling with a reality few predicted during the \"soft landing\" optimism of years past: the \"inflation trade\" is not only alive but has become the structural backbone of the current investment regime. Despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive attempts to anchor expectations, consumer price index (CPI) prints remain stubbornly lodged between 2.5% and 3.0%, fueled by a cocktail of persistent tariffs, record-high national debt, and a massive industrial appetite for precious metals driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nThis persistence has sent gold and silver to heights that once seemed hyperbolic. Gold is currently trading near $4,350 per ounce, while silver has surged to a record $75 per ounce, outperforming almost every major asset class in 2025. For the Federal Reserve, this represents a grueling \"last mile\" in their inflation fight\u2014one where traditional interest rate hikes have lost their potency against a backdrop of fiscal dominance and a global rush toward tangible assets.\nThe Road to $4,000 Gold: A 2025 Retrospective\nThe current market environment is the direct result of a series of \"inflation shocks\" that defined 2025. The year began with significant fiscal expansion concerns as extended tax cuts and new consumer-focused subsidies kept demand higher than the Fed\u2019s restrictive policy could dampen. By mid-2025, the \"Tariff Shock\" arrived, as broad-based international trade levies sparked a wave of front-loaded inflation. Markets, which had been pricing in a return to the 2% baseline, suddenly realized that \"sticky\" inflation was the new permanent state.\nThe situation reached a fever pitch in October 2025, when a brief but chaotic U.S. government shutdown delayed critical economic data. In the vacuum of information, gold acted as the ultimate \"chaos hedge,\" embarking on a parabolic run. By the time the Federal Reserve signaled a \"pause\" in its rate-hiking cycle in December 2025\u2014setting the Fed Funds rate at a target range of 3.50%\u20133.75%\u2014the \"debasement trade\" was fully entrenched. Central banks, particularly in the BRICS+ nations, have been the primary drivers, accumulating gold at a record pace of over 1,200 tonnes annually to diversify away from a dollar increasingly burdened by $38 trillion in national debt.\nWinners and Losers in the New Commodity Supercycle\nThe 2026 landscape has created a sharp divide between companies with \"real asset\" leverage and those vulnerable to rising input costs.\nThe Winners: Major mining conglomerates have seen their margins explode as metal prices rose faster than their energy and labor costs. Newmont (NYSE: NEM) and Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD) have emerged as the primary beneficiaries, reporting record free cash flow in their most recent quarterly filings. Barrick, in particular, has leveraged its in-house refining capabilities to meet the soaring demand for physical bullion from sovereign wealth funds. In the silver space, Pan American Silver (NYSE: PAAS) and Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) have seen their valuations double as silver\u2019s dual role as an inflation hedge and an industrial necessity for AI data centers creates a chronic supply deficit.\nOutside of mining, the retail sector is seeing a \"flight to value.\" Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) are thriving as middle-class consumers \"trade down\" to cope with persistent price pressures. These giants have used their massive scale to mitigate supply chain inflation, gaining significant market share from more discretionary-focused competitors.\nThe Losers: On the flip side, companies that rely on cheap credit or high-margin discretionary spending are struggling. Target (NYSE: TGT) has been a notable laggard, as its focus on \"wants\" over \"needs\" leaves it vulnerable to the erosion of household budgets. Similarly, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has faced a \"double squeeze\" of high borrowing costs for home renovations and the soaring cost of raw materials.\nPer"

                "body": "Gold Price Forecast: Peter Schiff Predicts $100,000 Per Ounce as Dollar Weakens\nIn 2024, economist Peter Schiff predicted the rally in gold prices was just beginning. According to Scrap Monster, the price of gold surged by 46% from October 2024 to October 2025, climbing from $2,652 per ounce to $3,995.\nDuring an interview with \"The Lead-Lag Report,\" Schiff offered an ambitious forecast for the precious metal. \"If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or to $100,000,\" he stated. At current prices, a climb to $100,000 would represent an upside of over 3,700%. He emphasized, \"There's no limit because, cause again, gold's not changing -- all we're doing is decreasing the value of the dollar.\"\nSchiff's forecast is rooted in his view on the risks of excessive money printing and inflation. \"I think the potential [for gold] is much higher because we're just going to print so much money. We're going to have so much inflation that the dollar is going to lose so much value that you're really going to need a lot of dollars to buy gold,\" he explained.\nGold has long been considered a popular hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currency, it cannot be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks. With its value untethered to any specific currency or economy, gold often acts as a \"safe haven\" asset during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty.\n1.

                "body": "The Middle East once seemed inseparable from oil \u2014 a resource that anchored state budgets, political bargains and global strategic partnerships. Now, that era of oil-led stability is fading into history, and something new \u2014 yet uncertain \u2014 is emerging in its wake. The region appears to be caught between two worlds: no longer anchored by oil\u2019s political gravity, and not yet equipped with a stable, inclusive framework for a post-oil future. This is not merely an economic transition; it is a political and governance conundrum unfolding in an increasingly multipolar global order.\nThe myth of transition without governance\nAcross capitals from Cairo to Riyadh, Abu Dhabi to Baghdad, governments are issuing bold statements about energy transition. Solar megaprojects, hydrogen ambitions and investment in renewables have become hallmarks of strategic planning. Yet these plans often overlook a stark reality: transition requires strong institutions and transparent governance, not just capital and technology.\nPut simply, technology can be bought \u2014 but governance cannot.\nIn many countries in the region, state legitimacy and institutional capacity have not kept up with the pace of energy ambitions. This disconnect threatens to render transition aspirational rather than substantive.\nREAD: US sanctions 29 vessels allegedly linked to Iranian oil\nInfrastructure fragility and the politics of power\nModern energy systems are defined as much by infrastructure as by the resources they convey. Transmission networks, cross-border grids, gas pipelines and supply chain management now carry political weight far beyond their technical functions.\nTake Iraq as an example. Chronic electricity shortages there are not merely engineering challenges; they are political liabilities. According to the World Bank, power outages cost the Iraqi economy several percentage points of GDP each year, while also feeding public frustration and social unrest .\nWhere power systems fail or are unreliable, citizens do not simply experience minor inconvenience \u2014 they judge the credibility of the state.\nMultipolar competition and fragmented dynamics\nAt the same time, the global shift towards multipolarity has reshaped energy geopolitics. The United States no longer retains uncontested sway in regional security and energy affairs. China has emerged as a major investor in infrastructure and energy projects, prioritising long-term supply contracts and alternative routes. Russia has demonstrated the leverage of energy as a geopolitical tool, particularly in Europe. The European Union, for its part, seeks diversification but is cautious about deep political entanglements.\nThis evolving power balance encourages short-term, bilateral energy deals over integrated, region-wide frameworks. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that without governance reform and regional coordination, energy transition efforts in the Middle East could deepen existing inequalities and instability rather than resolve them .\nRenewable projects as political signals\nSolar parks in the Gulf, wind farms along the North African coastline, and ambitious hydrogen strategies all signal modernisation. But technology without governance is hollow. Investment in renewables must be matched by:\n- Clear regulatory frameworks\n- Institutional transparency\n- Inclusive stakeholder engagement\nIf these elements are missing, renewable infrastructure risks becoming enclaves of privilege, serving elite interests instead of broader societal needs.\nThus, while the Middle East appears to be charging ahead with new energy modalities, the foundations necessary for long-term stability are still under construction.\nEnergy insecurity and social fragility\nEnergy shortages do not remain technical issues confined to power ministers and regulators. They have immediate political consequences.\nPower cuts have sparked protests in multiple Middle Eastern states. Fuel scarcity erodes confidence in government effectiveness. Attempts to reform"

                "body": "Jan. 2 (oilprice.com) Argentina, in a surprise development, overtook Colombia to become South America\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer. The country is undergoing a once-in-a-generation unconventional hydrocarbon boom, which began with Buenos Aires nationalizing integrated energy major YPF in 2012. Since then, Argentina\u2019s oil and natural gas output has kept soaring higher, regularly hitting new monthly highs as volumes of shale oil and gas production grow. It is Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, which is at the forefront of the boom with it responsible for this strong production growth.\nFor November 2025, Argentina\u2019s crude oil production, despite falling from the October 2025 record of 849,646 barrels per day to 844,386 barrels per day, was still an impressive 12.5% higher than a year earlier. This was the first month out of the last six where output did not rise to a new record high. Rapidly growing shale oil production in the Vaca Muerta shale, Spanish for Dead Cow, is driving Argentina\u2019s stunning production growth. For November 2025, shale oil output hit a new monthly record of 578,461 barrels per day, a 30.68% year over year increase, which saw it responsible for 68.51% Argentina\u2019s total production.\nNatural gas production, however, continues to decline. Output dropped 7% year over year to 4.2 billion cubic feet per day, the lowest level since December 2023. This represents a sharp drop from the record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day pumped for July 2025. It is rising shale gas output from the Vaca Muerta which is responsible for the solid growth of Argentina\u2019s natural gas production over the last five years. For November 2025, shale gas production fell 1% year over year to 2.7 billion cubic feet daily, which despite being significantly less than the record 3.8 billion cubic feet per day reported for July 2025, still comprised 65% of Argentina\u2019s total gas production.\nSince July 2025, a combination of well maintenance, reduced drilling activity due to weaker spot prices, and a lack of infrastructure, notably storage and pipeline facilities, which is impacting takeaway capacity, are weighing on output. Indeed, the lack of pipeline and other transportation infrastructure has long been viewed as a key constraint with the potential to impact production in the Vaca Muerta. Although the increasingly prolific shale formation and Argentina\u2019s national oil company YPF will be responsible for further production growth.\nThe 8.6-million-acre Vaca Muerta is a massive shale formation, roughly the size of Switzerland, located in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin in northern Patagonia. It is among the world\u2019s largest unconventional hydrocarbon resources and is frequently compared to the prolific Eagle Ford and Permian shales. The Vaca Muerta is estimated to contain 16 billion barrels of light tight oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of tight gas, making it the world\u2019s fourth-largest unconventional oil and second-largest unconventional gas reserve. According to analysts, characteristics such as superior shale thickness, greater quantities of biological material, higher reservoir pressures, and increased well productivity make the Vaca Muerta superior to major U.S. shale plays.\nAfter a decade of development, the Vaca Muerta is responsible for 69% of Argentina\u2019s oil production and 65% of the country\u2019s natural gas output. With less than a tenth of the formation under development, there is tremendous production growth ahead. By the end of the decade, Argentina\u2019s crude oil output is expected to hit at least 1 million barrels per day, with some analysts forecasting 1.5 million barrels per day by 2030. This is a massive increase over the 787,395 barrels per day lifted for the first 11 months of 2025. Natural gas output is expected to surpass 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, driven by the Vaca Muerta\u2019s rising shale gas production.\nIt is national oil company YPF and its unconventional hydrocarbon acreage in the Vaca Muerta that will be responsible for most of the e"

                "body": "Crude Prices Pressured by Concerns About a Global Oil Glut\nFebruary WTI crude oil (CLG26) on Friday closed down -0.10 (-0.17%), and February RBOB gasoline (RBG26) closed down -0.0168 (-0.08%).\nCrude oil and gasoline prices tumbled to 2-week lows on Friday on expectations for a record global supply surplus. Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the US government expect global production to exceed consumption, from a 4-year high in 2025 to a record this year. Friday's stronger dollar was also bearish for energy prices.\nDon\u2019t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart\u2019s best-in-class commodity analysis.Persistent geopolitical risks from Venezuela, Nigeria, and Russia are limiting crude price losses. Also, expectations that OPEC+ will stick to plans to pause further crude production increases are supportive of crude prices when the group meets during a monthly video conference on Sunday.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days rose +15% w/w to 129.33 million bbl in the week ended December 26.\nLast month, the IEA projected that the world crude surplus will widen to a record 3.815 million bpd in 2026 from a 4-year high of over 2.0 million bpd in 2025.\nStrength in Chinese crude demand is supportive for prices. According to Kpler data, China's crude imports in December are set to increase by 10% m/m to a record 12.2 million bpd as it rebuilds its crude inventories.\nOil prices also have support after the US last Thursday launched strikes on ISIS targets in Nigeria in a security and intelligence collaboration with the Nigerian government to combat rising terrorist attacks in the country. Nigeria is an OPEC member. Mr. Trump previously warned that the US would strike ISIS in Nigeria if the group did not stop killing Christians.\nOil prices have support from the US blockade of sanctioned oil tankers involved with Venezuelan oil shipments. The US Coast Guard forced the sanctioned oil tanker Bella 1 to turn away from Venezuela and head out into the Atlantic Ocean last week, according to a Bloomberg report. US forces have been shadowing the vessel as part of President Trump's blockade. US forces wanted to board Bella 1 near Barbados on Sunday, but the ship instead moved back out into the Atlantic Ocean.\nUkrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past four months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies. Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports.\nCrude also garnered support after OPEC+ on November 30 said it would stick to its plan to pause production increases in Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members would raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's November crude production fell by -10,000 bpd to 29.09 million bpd.\nLast month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus the previous month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit. Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\nWednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of December 26 were -3.0% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2"

                "body": "US Dollar\nThe USD is somewhat of the centerpiece of the Forex market. Pairs with the USD are considered major pairs and pairs without the Dollar are considered crosses; and when we get in a backdrop where the USD shows little to no trend, that can lead to a ranging backdrop in FX markets.\nInterestingly, even with the Dollar grinding in a range for pretty much the entire second-half of 2025, there are attractive trends to work with: GBP/USD for USD-weakness and USD/JPY for USD-strength. But whether the Greenback can trnd in 2026 will likely be determined by whether the currency basket\u2019s largest component of the Euro can similarly show some element of trend.\nThis is quite a bit different from how we came into last year, as a surging USD drove a plethora of parity calls for the EUR/USD pair. But, like the USD, the pair set a fresh extreme on January 13th and then held, eventually reversing in March and then trending cleanly for the rest of H1.\nComing into last year it was very easy to be a USD bull and coming into 2026, it\u2019s really easy to be a USD bear, and like we saw last year, that can be a dangerous backdrop as much of that hope for rate cuts is probably already factored into the currency\u2019s price.\nIn the USD, the monthly chart of DXY actually resembles the daily chart of EUR/USD in January and February of last year, where a prior bearish trend has halted with a consistent level of resistance show around the 100.00 handle (and in EUR/USD, it was around 1.0500).\nUSD Monthly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nComing into the New Year we\u2019ve now seen three weeks of support at the Fibonacci level plotted at 97.94, and it\u2019s the horizontal resistance taken from prior support at 100-100.22 that looms large for bulls, as that price was continually tested in 2025 but failed to give way.\nThat\u2019s the spot for bulls to beat in early-2026 trade, and if they can get above that and finally stage a breakout, it\u2019s the 102 handle that shows prominently above.\nUS Dollar Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nThe Euro is a whopping 57.6% of the DXY quote so in many cases the two markets are inextricably linked, and that certainly has been the case for the past year and a half.\nIn Q3 of 2024 as markets prepared for the Fed to finally start cutting rates, the USD tanked and EUR/USD jumped up to the 1.1200 handle. But, as the Fed cut, both markets stalled, clearly illustrating a \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 dynamic. In Q4 of 2024, both markets reversed with aggression and that\u2019s what led to the sentiment into last year\u2019s open that made it really easy to be a USD bull.\nA year later we have the mirror image of that scenario but, interestingly, even with the stacking of so many bearish USD drivers in H2 of last year, neither USD bears or EUR/USD bulls were able to force much of a move. And the same Fibonacci resistance remains in-play as we push into 2026.\nFor bears, the big spot to break in EUR/USD is the 1.1500 handle which was a rigid spot of support in Q4.\nIf the USD is going to trend, in either direction, it\u2019s probably going to need at least some participation from the DXY basket\u2019s largest component.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nWhile range and grind has been the name of the game in EUR/USD and the USD, GBP/USD has shown some trending capacity over the past couple of months, and if looking for USD-weakness, I think this presents a somewhat attractive argument.\nWhen the Dollar was threatening breakout at 100.22 in November, GBP/USD was in poor shape. The pair was at its most oversold in more than two years, and it was a mere 10 pips away from the psychological level at 1.3000. As I said at the webinar at the time, this was a tough market to chase-lower given that backdrop, and over the next couple of weeks it began to set up for reversal which took hold as USD-weakness showed more prominently in December.\nAt"

The disappointing manufacturing activity figures in the Eurozone and some of its main economies have increased bearish pressure on the Euro, in an otherwise calm New Year's session.\nFrom a wider perspective, however, the pair remains at a relatively short distance from the three-month highs at 1.1808 seen right before Christmas. The US Dollar USD) depreciated about 14% against the Euro in 2025, weighed by market concerns about US President Donald Trump's erratic trade policies, signs of deceleration in the US economy, and, lately, also the monetary policy divergence between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed).\nThe final German and Eurozone's HCOB Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) figures highlight the declining contribution of manufacturing activity in the regions' Gross Domestic Product. Investors are now looking at the final US S&P Manufacturing PMI release, which might provide some fresh impetus to the Greenback.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today.

The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Euro dives following weak manufacturing data\n- The Euro is losing ground against its main peers on Friday, following a string of weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity figures in Europe. Eurozone HCOB Manufacturing PMI has been revised down to 48.8 from the preliminary estimation of a 49.2 reading in December, reflecting a faster contraction from the 49.6 reading seen in November and the 50.0 in October.\n- Likewise, the German HCOB Manufacturing PMI has shown a weaker-than-expected activity, as December's decline has been revised down to 47.0, from the 47.7 preliminary estimation, and from November's 48.2 reading.\n- Italy's Manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.9 in December, from 50.6 in November, and Spain's manufacturing activity declined to 49.6 from 51.5. The positive exception has been the French Manufacturing PMI, which ticked up to 50.7 from 50.6 in November.\n- Later on Friday, the focus will shift to the US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, whose preliminary reading showed a slowdown to 51.8 in December from 52.2 in November. The figures are consistent with moderate business activity growth.\n- Investors, however, are likely to be attentive to the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls report, due at the end of next week, and the name of the person who will replace Chairman Jerome P\u00f4well at the Federal Reserve, which is expected to be disclosed in the coming weeks.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD approaches support at the 1.1700 area\nThe EUR/USD's immediate trend remains bearish, after breaching the trendline support from mid-November lows. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been rejected at the key 50 level, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned lower after failing to cross the signal line, which highlights the growing bearish momentum.\nBears, however, need to break support at the December 17 and 19 lows, near 1.1700, to confirm the trend shift.

The ECB\u2019s decision to keep rates unchanged and a cautious outlook supported the Euro, with anticipation of US policy shifts potentially affecting the Dollar.\nTechnically, the EUR/USD remained bullish, trading above the 100-day EMA at 1.1635 with an RSI at 59.8. The Bollinger bands indicate modest volatility, with resistance at the upper band of 1.1820 and support at the lower band near 1.1655, suggesting an upward bias.\nThe Euro\u2019s Global Significance\nThe Euro is used by 20 EU countries and ranks second globally in trading volume. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of forex transactions, with EUR/USD being the most traded pair. The ECB governs Eurozone monetary policy, adjusting interest rates to manage inflation and growth, impacting the Euro\u2019s value.\nEurozone inflation is tracked by the HICP, with rising rates prompting ECB intervention. Economic data, like GDP and PMI, affect the Euro, with strong economies bolstering its strength. Trade balance impacts the Euro by altering currency demand, where a surplus strengthens it.\nThe current environment for EUR/USD around 1.1755 is constructive, pointing towards further gains in the coming weeks. We see a clear divergence with the European Central Bank holding firm after their December 2025 meeting, while political uncertainty clouds the US Federal Reserve\u2019s future. This fundamental backdrop suggests a strategy of buying on any short-term dips.\nECB Strategy and Dollar Uncertainty\nThe ECB\u2019s data-dependent approach appears justified, especially as the latest flash estimate for Eurozone inflation in December 2025 ticked up to 2.9%. This stubborn inflation reduces the likelihood of rate cuts anytime soon, providing a solid floor for the Euro. Consequently, we should view the Euro\u2019s side of the equation as relatively stable to strong.\nOn the other side, the dollar faces headwinds from speculation over Fed Chair Powell\u2019s successor later this year. We remember the market volatility caused by similar political pressure on the Fed back in 2018, which undermines confidence in the dollar. This uncertainty about Fed independence is likely to weigh on the greenback until a clear path is announced.\nGiven the upward momentum and the price holding above the key 100-day moving average near 1.1635, buying call options with strike prices above the 1.1820 resistance level could be a viable strategy. The latest CFTC data also shows speculative net long positions building, confirming that market sentiment aligns with this bullish technical picture. Selling out-of-the-money puts could also be considered to collect premium while expressing this view."

                "body": "GBP/USD saw an increase on the year\u2019s first trading day, moving around 1.3470 during Asian hours on Friday. The daily chart analysis indicates a potential weakening of the bullish trend, as the pair hovers slightly below the ascending channel pattern\u2019s lower boundary.\nThe nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is rising and positioned above the 50-day EMA, with the spot price holding above both. This indicates support for the bullish trend, as the short-term dynamics favour the upside. The configuration of moving averages also backs the upward movement as the medium-term average continues to rise.\nUS Monetary Policy Impact\nThe GBP/USD pair gains momentum, trading close to 1.3480 during the early Asian session on Friday. Speculation around US Federal Reserve rate cuts drags down the US Dollar, benefiting the British Pound. The Fed ended 2025 with its largest annual decline in eight years, with the markets expecting two rate cuts this year.\nThis divergence between US and UK monetary policies weakens the Dollar\u2019s attractiveness. Currently, there is approximately a 15.0% probability that the Fed will reduce interest rates at its upcoming meeting in January.\nWe are seeing a continuation of the trend that began around this time last year, when bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts started to weigh heavily on the US dollar. The divergence between a dovish Fed and a more cautious Bank of England continues to be the main driver. This fundamental backdrop keeps the path of least resistance pointed upwards for GBP/USD.\nStrategic Trading Considerations\nThis view is strengthened by recent data from the end of 2025, which saw US inflation cool to 3.2%, giving the Fed a clear runway to start easing policy. In the UK, however, inflation proved more stubborn, ending the year at a higher 3.9%, forcing the Bank of England to maintain its stance. This economic divergence adds credibility to continued dollar weakness against the pound.\nGiven this bullish momentum, we should consider buying GBP/USD call options with expirations in the next four to six weeks. This strategy provides direct exposure to any rally towards the three-month highs, while clearly defining our maximum risk to the premium paid. It is a straightforward way to position for the expected upward move.\nFor those wanting to lower the initial cost, a bull call spread is an attractive alternative. By buying a call option and simultaneously selling a higher-strike call, we can significantly reduce the net premium. This is a suitable strategy if we anticipate a steady, but not explosive, climb in the exchange rate.\nImplied volatility in the pair is currently moderate, making options more reasonably priced than during the uncertain spikes we saw in mid-2025. Markets are now pricing in an over 80% probability of a Fed rate cut by March, which should keep a lid on any significant dollar rallies. This makes the environment favorable for establishing these bullish derivative positions."

                "body": "The US Dollar has been trading in a tight range near 98.20, as investors continue to factor in expectations of two more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. These rate cuts would narrow the interest rate gap with other major central banks, putting upward pressure on the Dollar to weaken.\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve after it lowered rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. And yes, that was the 3rd-rate 75 bps cut last year, coming as the labor market was cooling and inflation was still lingering. The Fed is still being watched closely as a result.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows that investors now think there\u2019s an 85.1% chance the Federal Reserve will leave rates unchanged at its January meeting, up from 84.5% just a week ago. On the other hand, the likelihood of a 25-bp rate cut fell slightly to 14.9%. This is likely because the market is still trying to weigh the impact of the latest economic data, and there\u2019s been no clear indication from Federal Reserve officials when, or if, they\u2019ll lower rates next time.\nBut there\u2019s another factor at play here: Donald Trump is going to nominate a new Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, and that could significantly impact monetary policy and, therefore, the value of the dollar. Many people expect the new chair to be more dovish and thus more likely to cut rates, further weighing on the dollar.\nOn the other hand, there is still some support for the dollar stemming from its status as a safe-haven currency, and investors remain cautious about the global economy. However, the expectations of further rate cuts in the US and the potential change in leadership at the Federal Reserve continue to cap any gains in the dollar, and it\u2019s trading near recent lows.\nThe focus will be on upcoming US employment data and any comments from Federal Reserve officials, which could give us a better idea of where the dollar is headed in the short term.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has been stabilizing near 98.30 and is currently holding within a short-term ascending channel. After rebounding from the 97.75 low, it has been consolidating around the 98.25\u201398.35 zone, which is also a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This zone is providing some near-term support.\nThe 50-period MA is flattening out, while the 200-period MA near 98.50 is still capping upside. RSI near 55 still suggests momentum is improving without getting overbought. If the dollar can break above 98.50, it could open the door to 99.00\u201399.35, but if it breaks below 98.25, it could pull back towards 98.00.\nThe GBP/USD pair has been stabilizing near $1.3465, holding above short-term support after a modest pullback from recent highs. The price remains within a well-defined ascending channel on the 2-hour chart, with the 50-period moving average near $1.3480 acting as near-term resistance.\nThe 200-period MA around $1.3400 remains a solid support level. Immediate support is seen at $1.3430, followed by $1.3340. If the pair can break above $1.3500, it could open the door to $1.3535. RSI near 45 suggests that momentum is neutral but stabilizing.\nThe EUR/USD pair is consolidating near $1.1735, easing from recent highs while holding within a broader ascending channel on the 2-hour chart. The price has slipped below the 50-period moving average, a sign of short-term pressure, but the 200-period MA near $1.1700 remains key support.\nThe $1.1750 level remains pivotal, having marked prior resistance-turned-pivot. RSI near 40 is still reflecting cooling momentum without reaching oversold conditions.\nBut a sustained hold above $1.1700 will keep the broader uptrend intact, while a break lower could expose $1.1665. The price should break back above $1.1760 for the uptrend to resume.\nArslan is a finance MBA and also holds an MPhil degree in behavioral finance.

Check our detailed guide-\nThe US dollar closed 2025 with the sharpest annual decline in eight years, reinforced by continued Fed easing in 2026, which included two more rate cuts.\nMarkets are already anticipating a 15% probability of a January rate cut, despite FOMC minutes revealing no haste unless inflation shows obvious signs of cooling. The softer NFP report in December, adding 95k jobs against the expected 150k, has further reinforced the view that labor markets are losing momentum, pressuring the Fed to ease soon.\nOn the other hand, political uncertainty has also contributed to the dollar\u2019s weakness, as President Trump openly expressed his preference for a dovish successor to Fed Chair, potentially replacing Powell in May. The remarks have raised questions over the Fed\u2019s autonomy, inducing further risk premium into the dollar.\nBy contrast, the Bank of England maintains a cautious policy. The central bank reduced rates by 25 bps in December to 3.75%, the lowest level in three years, while Governor Bailey emphasized that further easing is likely. However, UK inflation remains sticky at around 3.1%, compared to the US Core PCE at 2.8%, giving the BoE less urgency to ease rates. The policy divergence provides a floor under sterling despite the BoE\u2019s expected gradual easing through 2026.\nPositioning dynamics also support the pound, as continued short-covering remains evident in the currency following the reduction of UK fiscal uncertainty. Consequently, the pair remains comfortably above the mid-1.3400 level. However, the upside is primarily driven by the dollar weakness rather than domestic strength.\nLooking ahead, major banks anticipate the pair to stay in a broad range of 1.35 \u2013 1.47 in 2026, with forecasts clustered within 1.36-1.40. Although the first half of 2026 appears constructive for the pound, conviction remains limited amid the UK\u2019s weaker growth, rising unemployment, and BoE rate cuts expected later this year.\nGBP/USD Technical Forecast: Bullish Pin Bar\nThe GBP/USD found a strong support at the 100-period MA near 1.3400 in the last trading session, forming a bullish pin bar, which points to the beginning of a fresh bullish impulsive wave. Though the price remains capped by the 50-period and 20-period MAs, with flat RSI near the 50.0 mark, the pair remains in good shape to test the December swing highs of 1.3530.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers?

The Aussie appreciates nearly 0.5% against the US Dollar in the daily chart, so far, buoyed by a positive market sentiment and heightened hopes that the next move by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will ber a rate hike.\nThe hawkish comments by RBA Governor Michelle Bullock, after the December 9 monetary policy decision, and the minutes of the meeting, revealed that policymakers\u2019 concerns about inflation have taken center stage, and that the possibility of a rate hike was at the table last month.\nConsumer inflation accelerated to a 3.8% yearly pace in October, from 3.6% in September and 3.2% in August. November\u2019s inflation report is due next week, and wage growth figures suggest that price pressures might have continued growing. If that is the case, bets of an upcoming RBA rate hike are likely to underpin the Aussie\u2019s appreciation.\nIn the US, on the contrary, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is still halfway through its easing cycle. Recent US data has been fairly positive, including Wednesday\u2019s weekly Jobless Claims figures, but that will not deter US President Donald Trump from replacing Chairman Jerome Powell with a dovish partisan at the end of his term in May.\nTrading volumes remain thin on Friday, with markets in Japan and China closed on New Year\u2019s festivities. The only event worth mentioning will be the US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI release, which is expected to confirm that the sector\u2019s business activity eased to 51.8 in December from 52.2 in November, still at levels consistent with moderate activity growth.\n(This story was corrected on January 2 at 08:00 GMT to say US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, not US S&P Global Marketing PMI, as previously reported)\nCentral banks FAQs\nCentral Banks have a key mandate which is making sure that there is price stability in a country or region. Economies are constantly facing inflation or deflation when prices for certain goods and services are fluctuating. Constant rising prices for the same goods means inflation, constant lowered prices for the same goods means deflation. It is the task of the central bank to keep the demand in line by tweaking its policy rate. For the biggest central banks like the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of England (BoE), the mandate is to keep inflation close to 2%.\nA central bank has one important tool at its disposal to get inflation higher or lower, and that is by tweaking its benchmark policy rate, commonly known as interest rate. On pre-communicated moments, the central bank will issue a statement with its policy rate and provide additional reasoning on why it is either remaining or changing (cutting or hiking) it. Local banks will adjust their savings and lending rates accordingly, which in turn will make it either harder or easier for people to earn on their savings or for companies to take out loans and make investments in their businesses. When the central bank hikes interest rates substantially, this is called monetary tightening. When it is cutting its benchmark rate, it is called monetary easing.\nA central bank is often politically independent. Members of the central bank policy board are passing through a series of panels and hearings before being appointed to a policy board seat. Each member in that board often has a certain conviction on how the central bank should control inflation and the subsequent monetary policy. Members that want a very loose monetary policy, with low rates and cheap lending, to boost the economy substantially while being content to see inflation slightly above 2%, are calle"

                "body": "Understanding Central Banks\nA central bank\u2019s primary role is to maintain price stability by adjusting policy rates to manage inflation or deflation. Interest rate changes influence the economy by affecting bank lending and savings rates. Central banks have both \u2018hawks\u2019 and \u2018doves\u2019 who advocate for different monetary policies. A chairman or president leads policy discussions and communicates decisions.\nThe Australian dollar is showing significant strength against the US dollar, driven by a clear divergence in central bank policy. We see the Reserve Bank of Australia hinting at rate hikes to combat inflation, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to continue its easing cycle. This policy split presents a strong case for being long the Aussie dollar in the weeks ahead.\nGovernor Bullock\u2019s recent hawkish tone reminds us of the aggressive hiking cycle we saw back in 2022 and 2023, when the RBA rapidly lifted its cash rate by over 400 basis points. With Australian consumer inflation accelerating to 3.8% in October of 2025, another hot print in next week\u2019s report for November could easily push the RBA to act. Traders should consider buying AUD/USD call options to capitalize on a potential upward surge following that data release.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US dollar appears vulnerable as the Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates. Even with fairly solid economic data, like weekly jobless claims holding steady around a low 210,000, political pressure is mounting for more rate cuts. The anticipated replacement of Chairman Powell in May with a more dovish leader only strengthens the argument for a weaker dollar.\nMarket Dynamics Between The US And Australia\nFor us, the main event is the widening policy gap between the two central banks, which is pushing the AUD/USD above the key 0.6700 level. The upcoming Australian inflation report is the most critical catalyst on the immediate horizon. A higher-than-expected number will likely add more momentum to this rally."

The cautious pace of the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) monetary tightening weighs on the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the Greenback. Traders will take more cues from the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for December, which is due next week.\nThe BoJ raised its key interest rate to 0.75% from 0.50% in December, its second hike of the year, to help curb inflation. However, the cautious pace of tightening and the lack of a clear timeline for future hikes have disappointed markets, dragging the JPY lower and acting as a tailwind for the pair.\nNonetheless, some intervention from Japanese authorities might help limit the JPY\u2019s losses. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama emphasized the official is monitoring foreign exchange (FX) movements with a \"high sense of urgency\" and is prepared to take \"appropriate action\" against excessive and one-sided moves.\nThe prospect of a US interest rate cut this year and renewed concerns over the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) independence could exert some selling pressure on the USD. US President Donald Trump said that he expects the next Fed Chairman to keep interest rates low and never \u201cdisagree\u201d with him. Traders are pricing in two rate reductions in the year compared to one predicted by a divided Fed.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "The USD/JPY advances towards 157.00 during early European trading on Friday, supported by the Bank of Japan\u2019s cautious approach to monetary tightening. This sentiment undermines the Japanese Yen, though concerns about potential intervention may limit further depreciation.\nBank of Japan raised its key interest rate to 0.75% from 0.50% in December, marking the second hike of the year. Despite these efforts to address inflation, the measured pace and uncertainty about future increases have weakened the Yen against the US Dollar.\nIntervention Concerns\nJapanese authorities may intervene to restrict the Yen\u2019s losses, and Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stresses vigilance over foreign exchange movements. Concerns over a US rate cut and the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence could affect the USD\u2019s performance. President Trump anticipates that future Fed policy will align with his views, with traders forecasting two rate cuts this year.\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s value is influenced by various factors, including Bank of Japan policy, bond yield differentials, and risk sentiment. The BoJ\u2019s recent shift from an ultra-loose policy provides some Yen support. In turbulent times, the Yen\u2019s safe-haven status attracts investment, boosting its value against riskier currencies.\nWe remember seeing the dollar push towards 157 against the yen in December 2025 because the Bank of Japan was moving so slowly. The December US jobs report came in softer than expected last week, with Nonfarm Payrolls at 165,000, reinforcing the view that the Federal Reserve will cut rates. This has put a temporary ceiling on the dollar\u2019s advance for now.\nAs of today, the pair is still uncomfortably high, trading around the 157.20 level, which keeps intervention risk extremely elevated. We saw Japanese authorities intervene heavily with yen-buying operations in 2024 as the rate approached the 158-160 zone, a precedent we cannot ignore. The market is therefore very nervous about pushing much higher without a strong catalyst.\nInterest Rate Differential Impact\nThe fundamental reason for dollar strength remains the interest rate differential, with the spread between US and Japanese 10-year bond yields still over 3.5 percentage points. This makes it profitable to hold dollars over yen, providing underlying support for the currency pair. However, with the Fed expected to cut rates twice this year, this gap is projected to narrow.\nFor derivative traders, this setup suggests buying volatility is the prudent move for the coming weeks. One-month implied volatility on USD/JPY options has climbed back above 10% as uncertainty about intervention timing and Fed policy grows. Using options strategies like straddles or buying out-of-the-money puts can protect against a sudden, sharp drop caused by intervention.\nLooking ahead, we must watch for any further verbal warnings from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance, as this is often the final signal before they act. The next major data point will be the upcoming US inflation report. A high inflation number could reignite the dollar\u2019s rally and truly test the resolve of Japanese officials at the 158 level."

In December, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75%, marking the second rate hike of the year aimed at curbing inflationary pressures.\nHowever, the central bank did not provide a clear timeline for subsequent rate hikes in its policy statement. The overall tone was cautious, raising doubts about its ability to maintain a sustained tightening cycle.\nAmid unmet policy expectations, the yen came under pressure and weakened, providing upward momentum for the dollar against the yen. Official intervention expectations offered potential support for the yen.\nNevertheless, vigilance over exchange rate volatility is growing within Japan. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stated that the government is closely monitoring foreign exchange market movements with a 'high sense of urgency' and is prepared to take 'appropriate actions' if excessive or one-sided fluctuations occur.\nThis statement has, to some extent, limited market bets on further significant depreciation of the yen. The medium-term trend of the dollar remains influenced by discussions around rate cuts and policy independence.\nFrom the perspective of the dollar, markets have begun to reassess the Federal Reserve's policy outlook. Traders now expect the Fed to implement two rate cuts this year, higher than the previous internal forecast leaning toward a single cut.\nAdditionally, President Trump's remarks expressing a desire for the next Federal Reserve Chair to maintain low interest rates and align with his policy stance have sparked discussions about the Fed's independence, potentially creating some headwinds for the dollar in the medium term.\nIn the short term, markets will focus on the upcoming US December non-farm payroll report to gain clearer policy guidance.\nFrom the daily chart perspective, USD/JPY maintains a clear upward trend structure. The exchange rate continues to operate above the primary moving average system, with medium- and short-term moving averages aligned in a bullish formation, providing support to prices.\nThe momentum indicator RSI is at a relatively high level but has not yet entered the extreme overbought zone, indicating that upward momentum remains intact while short-term volatility risks have increased somewhat. Resistance above is focused on the 157.50\u2013158.00 range; if effectively breached, it may open up a new round of upward movement.\nSupport below is located in the 156.20\u2013156.00 range; once broken, it may trigger a phase of technical correction.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nOverall, the strength of the US dollar against the Japanese yen stems more from differences in the pace of monetary policy between the US and Japan. As long as the Bank of Japan maintains a cautious stance and the Federal Reserve has not explicitly initiated rapid easing, the exchange rate is prone to rise rather than fall.\nHowever, it is important to be vigilant about the fact that the heightened attention of Japanese officials to exchange rates implies that if the yen depreciates too quickly, the risk of policy intervention will significantly increase.\nIn the short term, USD/JPY may maintain a strong oscillation pattern at high levels, but the risk of a pullback should not be overlooked near key resistance zones."

                "body": "USD/CAD trades near 1.3710 amidst reduced US Dollar strength, influenced by expected Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. As US President plans a potential new Fed chair nomination, monetary policy could lean towards lower interest rates.\nRecent Federal Open Market Committee minutes reveal a possible pause in rate cuts if inflation trends downwards, though some officials suggest maintaining current rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada indicates a hold on rates despite a 0.3% real GDP drop in October.\nCanadian Dollar Gains Strength\nThe Canadian Dollar gains traction with higher Oil prices, as it plays a crucial role in Canada, the US\u2019s major crude supplier. Geopolitical tensions, particularly around Ukraine and Russia, may push Oil prices further.\nUS sanctions on Oil traders linked to Venezuela\u2019s government and upcoming OPEC+ meetings also impact Oil price movements. West Texas Intermediate crudes hold steady around $57.60.\nFactors driving the Canadian Dollar include interest rates, economic health, Oil prices, and trade balance. The Bank of Canada influences CAD through interest rates and credit condition policies.\nInflation often leads to higher rates, boosting CAD, while economic data like GDP and employment figures sway its value. Akhtar Faruqui, a Forex Analyst, provides insight into such dynamic market topics.\nGiven the market\u2019s current positioning, we see the downward trend in USD/CAD likely continuing into the coming weeks. The primary driver is the widening policy gap between a dovish Federal Reserve and a more neutral Bank of Canada. With the Fed funds futures market now pricing in a greater than 70% probability of a rate cut by March, the path of least resistance for the US dollar appears to be lower.\nCrude Oil Prices and Market Trends\nLooking back at 2025, the Fed\u2019s three rate cuts were a clear response to a cooling economy, a trend confirmed by the latest December jobs report which showed non-farm payrolls growing by only 95,000. The expected nomination of a new, more dovish Fed chair in May only adds to the conviction that lower rates are coming. This contrasts with the Bank of Canada, which is holding firm as recent inflation data for December showed CPI holding at 2.4%, giving them little reason to ease policy.\nThe strength in crude oil provides another significant tailwind for the Canadian dollar. West Texas Intermediate holding near $57.60 is supported by ongoing geopolitical risks and the latest EIA report showing an unexpected draw in US crude inventories, signaling tighter supply. We anticipate that the upcoming OPEC+ meeting on Sunday will affirm current production levels, which should keep a floor under oil prices.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook suggests buying put options on USD/CAD is a prudent strategy to position for further downside. We would look at February or March expirations with strike prices around the 1.3600 level to capitalize on the expected move. This approach defines risk while offering significant upside if the pair breaks below its recent support.\nAlternatively, for those with higher conviction, establishing short positions in USD/CAD futures contracts is a more direct approach. Key technical levels suggest that a break of 1.3700 could open the door to a test of the 1.3550 support zone we saw in the third quarter of 2025. A stop-loss order placed just above the recent highs near 1.3780 would be a sensible way to manage the risk on this trade."

                "body": "USD/CAD Near 1.37 as Fed Cut Bets Clash With Oil Strength in Early 2026\nUSD/CAD began the year hovering around 1.3726 \u2013 1.3735, stopped short of strong follow-through, and showed only a mild upswing.\nQuick overview\n- USD/CAD started the year around 1.3726 \u2013 1.3735 but showed only a mild upswing amid a struggle between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar.\n- Expectations of two Fed rate cuts later this year are weighing on the US dollar, compounded by speculation about a potential change in Fed leadership.\n- Despite a 0.3% contraction in Canadian GDP, the Canadian dollar remains stable due to the Bank of Canada's patient approach and rising oil prices.\n- Technically, USD/CAD is trading at 1.3735, with a focus on maintaining levels above 1.3705 to target higher resistance near 1.3800.\nUSD/CAD began the year hovering around 1.3726 \u2013 1.3735, stopped short of strong follow-through, and showed only a mild upswing. On Friday it did manage a little push towards 1.3730 before the momentum just fizzled out, another sign of the ongoing tug-of-war between a struggling US dollar and a remarkably resilient Canadian dollar. As 2026 got underway, the market players looked very selective \u2013 they\u2019re not taking a view, instead responding to policy news and totally ignoring breakouts.\nThe expectation that the Fed will deliver two rate cuts later on this year is still weighing heavily on the dollar. That has been reinforced by speculation that President Donald Trump may be looking to bring in a new Fed chairperson when Jerome Powell\u2019s term runs out in May, raising serious questions about whether we will see a more easygoing policy stance from the US central bank.\nFed Signals Cap Dollar Strength\nA look at the minutes from the Fed\u2019s December meeting shows the committee was divided. Some folks were arguing for holding off on further rate cuts if inflation continues to slow, while others were pushing not to cut rates again after the three cuts in 2025 to protect the labour market. This lack of consensus has kept US interest rates in check and limited the upside for the US dollar.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian dollar has been relatively stable. Even after the stats showed that Canadian GDP had shrunk by 0.3% in October, the market still felt pretty comfortable with the Bank of Canada\u2019s steady tone. The BoC has been signaling that it\u2019s patient \u2013 no need to rush into action \u2013 and that has helped the CAD hold its own despite the weaker growth data. The next bit of news to focus on is the S&P Global Canada Manufacturing PMI report, which will give us some idea of what\u2019s happening in the domestic market.\nOil Prices Give CAD an Extra Lift\nHigher oil prices are also helping the Canadian dollar out a bit \u2013 and that\u2019s because Canada is the biggest crude oil exporter to the US, so when the energy market tightens, Canada tends to do a bit better too. Recent supply worries linked to Ukraine and broader global tensions have kept oil prices firm, in turn helping cap the upside for USD/CAD.\nUSD/CAD Technical Picture Points to a Gradual Recovery\nFrom a technical standpoint, USD/CAD is currently trading at 1.3735 on the four-hour chart, bouncing back from the late December low of 1.3643. The price action is contained within a short-term rising channel, and an ascending trendline has been guiding higher lows.\nPrice has also reclaimed that 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 1.3705 and is now testing the 50% level near 1.3724. As long as it holds above that zone, its focus will be on the 61.8% retracement at 1.3743, with a bit broader resistance area up near 1.3805.\nThe 50-period EMA is starting to flatten below price, and the RSI is up around 63, which suggests improving momentum \u2013 but not quite getting out of control.\nTrade idea: a pullback to 1.3710 keeps the bias constructive, with scope to move up toward 1.3800 as long as price stays above 1.3680.\n- Check out our free forex signals\n- Follow the top economic events on FX Leaders economic calendar\n- Trade better, discover more F"

                "body": "The GBP/JPY exchange rate remains below the 211.60 resistance as the British Pound continues a mild upward trend against the Japanese Yen. This occurs amidst modest risk sentiment and reduced trading volumes due to New Year closures in China and Japan.\nUK Manufacturing PMI is set to confirm improved business activity in December, predicted to rise to 51.2 from 50.2 in November. Despite this, the release will have limited impact unless the figures are much different from initial estimates.\nExchange Rate Dynamics\nGBP/JPY trades at 211.17, with attempts to surpass 211.50 not yet successful. A bearish divergence with the RSI points to a possible downward reversal, with immediate support at the trendline around 210.15 to 210.05.\nIf the bulls succeed in breaking 211.59, higher targets like the 127.2% Fibonacci extension at 212.75 and 161.8% extension at 214.38 may become relevant. Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen shows a percentage change that places it as the strongest against the US Dollar, despite its mild performance against other major currencies.\nWe are seeing the Pound struggle against a tough resistance level around 211.60 against the Yen. This ceiling has held firm for the past two weeks, making it a critical point to watch. Derivative traders should note the indecision here, as a breakout or rejection is imminent.\nThe underlying strength in the UK economy offers some support for the Pound. The final UK Manufacturing PMI for December 2025 confirmed expansion, and recent ONS data showed GDP growth in the final quarter of 2025 was a resilient 0.3%. This fundamental backdrop might encourage traders to buy call options, betting on an eventual break above resistance.\nTechnical And Fundamental Analysis\nHowever, a bearish divergence on the intraday charts warns us of a potential reversal. This technical signal suggests the upward momentum is fading, presenting an opportunity for those looking at put options. Looking back at the Bank of England\u2019s December 2025 meeting, we saw a growing debate about when to start easing policy, which could cap the Pound\u2019s strength.\nGiven the tight range between support near 210.05 and resistance at 211.60, we could see a sharp move in the coming weeks. We remember the significant volatility spikes in this pair, like the one in the autumn of 2022, which shows how quickly it can move once a key level breaks. This suggests strategies like a long straddle could be effective, profiting from a large price swing in either direction.\nWe must also consider that the Yen\u2019s current weakness is partly due to holiday-thinned markets. As Japanese traders return, we might see the Yen strengthen, especially as core inflation in late 2025 remained stubbornly above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target. This potential for renewed Yen strength could easily push the pair down from its current highs."

Dead when transactions cost more than the payments. The on-chain game where every move is recorded? Unplayable when moves cost $50.\nDevelopers respond by building different things. High ETH prices push development toward high-value applications. DeFi protocols handling millions make sense. NFT drops for wealthy collectors\u2019 works. But social applications, gaming, and anything requiring frequent transactions get shelved until prices calm down.\nLayer 2 solutions were supposed to fix this. And they help. But L2 adoption itself correlates with ETH price. When the mainnet is cheap, nobody bothers with L2s. When it\u2019s expensive, everyone scrambles to migrate. This creates a weird cycle where the infrastructure we need most during high prices takes the longest to build because everyone\u2019s distracted by the high prices.\nThe price sensitivity changes fundamental design decisions.\nFunding Follows Price\nWhen ETH is pumping, everyone\u2019s a Web3 investor. VCs who couldn\u2019t spell Ethereum suddenly need blockchain exposure. Corporate innovation labs get blank checks. Accelerators pop up overnight. Money flows like water, and a lot of it goes to genuinely terrible ideas that would never get funded in rational times.\nThe quality of projects funded during bull markets is noticeably worse than bear markets. Data from 2017 and 2021 shows most bull market projects die within 18 months. They were solutions looking for problems, funded because investors had capital to deploy and FOMO to satisfy.\nBear markets produce better builders. When ETH is down 70%, only true believers keep building. The tourists leave, the mercenaries pivot to AI, and what remains are people who actually care about the technology. These projects have better survival rates, stronger communities, and more realistic use cases.\nGrant programs fluctuate wildly with price. The Ethereum Foundation, major protocols, and DAOs all fund development. But their treasuries are usually in ETH. When the price drops 50%, so does their ability to fund. Projects that seemed fully funded suddenly need to cut features or find new revenue.\nUser Adoption Cycles\nUsers follow price more than innovation. When ETH is rising, everyone wants to try Web3 apps. Your aunt asks about NFTs. Your barber mentions DeFi. Apps that couldn\u2019t get ten users suddenly have waiting lists. The technology didn\u2019t improve \u2013 the price just made it interesting.\nThis creates a chicken-and-egg problem. Developers need users to validate ideas. Users only show up when prices rise. Prices rise when there\u2019s innovation. Innovation needs developers. The cycle is self-reinforcing but fragile. Break any link and everything stalls.\nLow prices filter for true users who value the technology. But there aren\u2019t enough of them to sustain most projects. A DeFi protocol might have amazing technology, but if only 100 people use it, it\u2019s effectively dead. The users who remain during bear markets are loyal but insufficient.\nInnovation Cycles\nReal innovation happens during low prices but gets recogn"

                "body": "What is Ethereum Beacon Chain?\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain powers the next-generation ETH network and enables secure staking for millions of users. But how does it work\u2014and what makes it essential to Ethereum\u2019s future? Understanding the beacon chain is the key to unlocking the potential of Ethereum staking and building trust in the evolving ecosystem. In this guide, you'll learn what the beacon chain is, how it supports Ethereum 2.0, the fundamentals of staking (including with BETH), how consensus and validator rewards work, plus real-world use cases and security best practices. Whether you're a newcomer or ready to dive deeper, this article covers everything you need to know\u2014including recent stats, leading explorers, and how to participate safely with OKX.\nWhat Is the Ethereum Beacon Chain?\nThe beacon chain is the foundational backbone of Ethereum 2.0, designed to usher in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus and transform the way Ethereum operates. Unlike Ethereum's original proof-of-work (PoW) system, the beacon chain coordinates validators, manages staking, and oversees the consensus process that keeps the network secure. Launched in December 2020, it became the heart of Ethereum\u2019s transition to a more scalable, green, and decentralized infrastructure.\nThe beacon chain was developed to manage validator selection, track consensus, and introduce protocols for network upgrades. It monitors the integrity of transactions and ensures the network is robust against attacks or failures. Since the Ethereum mainnet merge (September 2022), all new ETH blocks are secured via the beacon chain\u2019s proof-of-stake processes\u2014marking a major milestone in Ethereum's evolution.\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: Proof-of-stake drastically reduces energy use compared to PoW, making Ethereum more eco-friendly and future-ready.\nBeacon Chain vs. Ethereum Mainnet\nPrior to the merge, the Ethereum mainnet processed transactions using proof-of-work, while the beacon chain operated in parallel, focusing on staking and validator coordination. The mainnet merge combined these two chains. Now, the beacon chain is the consensus engine securing the entire Ethereum network\u2014eliminating PoW mining and fully embracing PoS. This enables better scalability, higher security, and sustainable growth.\nConsensus & Epochs\nConsensus is how the network agrees on the validity of transactions and blocks. In Ethereum's PoS, validators propose and attest to new blocks. The beacon chain organizes time into periods called epochs (6.4 minutes, or 32 blocks each). Within an epoch, validators are shuffled and selected at random to propose blocks and confirm transactions, keeping the system both secure and decentralized. Honest validators are rewarded with ETH, while malicious or offline ones risk penalties.\nOKX supports Ethereum upgrades by providing in-depth educational resources on OKX Learn and gives users simple access to staking and network advancements as they unfold.\nLive Beacon Chain Stats & Market Overview\nTo trust any blockchain, you need live data and transparency. The beacon chain provides rich, publicly available stats\u2014empowering users to monitor the health of Ethereum staking, validator performance, and overall network activity.\n- ETH/BETH Price: ETH and BETH usually trade 1:1, but check live markets for differences on OKX and other exchanges.\n- Total ETH Staked & Validators: Over 27 million ETH staked, with 900,000+ active validators (as of mid-2024).\n- Market Cap: Ethereum\u2019s total market cap ranks second among blockchains, while BETH\u2019s market cap reflects the portion of staked ETH.\n- Volume and Supply: Monitor circulating supply, 24h trading volume, and full diluted value (FDV) via OKX\u2019s market dashboard or official explorers.\n- Contract Address: Beacon chain deposit contract (e.g., 0x000...c0) and BETH contract info are public.\nMarket Cap and Circulating Supply\nNumbers above are approximate and subject to rapid change.

                "body": "Will 2026 Be Ethereum's Breakout Year for Value Growth?\nAccording to an article from Decrypt, Ethereum's ETH hit a new all-time high this year, but its price action still seems insufficient to many relative to the network's technical and economic triumphs.\nEthereum sits between Bitcoin's legitimacy and other tokens, but hasn't had its \"Bitcoin moment\" yet. Decrypt's series investigating themes for the next year asks if 2026 will be when Ethereum starts to significantly grow in value. Vivek Raman, co-founder of Ethereum-focused Wall Street firm Etherealize, told Decrypt that the network's mass adoption moment is now. \"And I don't say that lightly,\" Raman said.\nRaman has seen Wall Street giants flock to Ethereum this year and anticipates ETH will become the \"default asset\" of an increasingly on-chain traditional economy. He stated that after 10 years, the \"hockey stick adoption moment\" is finally here. As tokenized assets become mainstream and institutions engage with them more sophisticatedly, these developments could unlock additional billions of dollars in value within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nJames Smith, the Ethereum Foundation's head of ecosystem, told Decrypt, \"Tokenizing a Treasury bill was 2024. Making it work inside DeFi is 2026.\" Smith predicts assets tokenized as a novelty will fade next year, as \"assets that generate yield or serve as DeFi collateral attract capital.\"\nThese developments could dramatically increase capital flowing through Ethereum, boosting ETH's value as the engine of a network underpinning DeFi and more of the traditional economy. However, expectations for ETH catching up to BTC by next year should be tempered. \"ETH, in the end, is going to elevate to becoming a store of value alongside Bitcoin,\" Raman said. \"But it's basically five years before where Bitcoin's inflection point was.\"\n1.

                "body": "The end of 2025 became a turning point for Solana. The network is increasingly being perceived as infrastructure for institutional products, rather than a platform for retail speculation. This is confirmed by data on tokenized real-world assets, which have reached a historic high.\nBy the end of December, the volume of such assets on the network reached $873.3 million. Over the month, this figure grew by almost 10%. At the same time, the participant base expanded: the number of holders increased to 126,236 addresses, adding 18.4%. For the market, this is a direct signal\u2014interest in the on-chain format from major players is becoming systemic, not situational.\nGovernment bonds set the scale\nThe foundation of growth is formed by instruments related to the US debt market. The most significant products remain the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund with a capitalization of about $255.4 million and Ondo US Dollar Yield at $175.8 million.\nIt was precisely such assets that provided the network with its initial institutional inflow. However, the structure of demand is gradually becoming more complex, going beyond just bond solutions.\nStocks are appearing in the ecosystem\nSolana is also starting to attract capital in the segment of tokenized stocks. Instruments like Tesla xStock and NVIDIA xStock have already added tens of millions of dollars to the network. This indicates a shift from test launches to the formation of a full-fledged product line aimed at professional market participants.\nIn fact, the network is consolidating an asset class that was previously characteristic only of traditional financial infrastructure.\nSolana accelerates amid competitors\nEthereum continues to hold first place in tokenization with RWA volumes of about $12.3 billion. It is followed by BNB Chain with about $2 billion. However, after a strong finish to 2025, Solana has noticeably accelerated its growth rate and begun to close the gap.\nA key role was played by the approval of six ETFs for SOL at once in October 2025. According to market estimates, institutional investors directed about $765 million into the asset. For traditional finance, this became a marker of trust and a signal of reduced regulatory risks.\nWestern Union\u2019s choice strengthened the effect\nThe ecosystem gained additional weight from Western Union\u2019s decision to use Solana as the base network for its stablecoin money transfer platform.\nThe project is aimed at an audience of over 150 million clients and is set to launch in early 2026. For Solana, this is not just a new use case, but confirmation of the network\u2019s readiness to handle large-scale payment flows in real business.\nThe price is not yet catching up with the fundamentals\nDespite the growth of institutional presence, SOL\u2019s dynamics remain restrained. At the beginning of 2026, the token is trading near $125\u2014significantly below the January 2025 high of $190. From the all-time peak of $293.3, the price still lags by about 57%.\nAt the same time, network metrics look significantly stronger. Over the past 30 days, applications in the Solana ecosystem have generated about $110 million in on-chain revenue, outperforming competitors in operational efficiency.\nWhat could change the balance\nAnalysts are increasingly pointing to the regulatory factor as a potential trigger. The adoption of the CLARITY Act in the US in 2026 could sharply accelerate the tokenization process and redistribute capital flows. In this scenario, Solana is seen as one of the main beneficiaries.\nThe focus is on long-term trends\u2014stablecoins and the transfer of traditional assets into digital format. And it is in these segments that Solana is already demonstrating practical results.\nWhat next?\nSolana is gradually rebuilding its reputation. The growth of tokenized assets, participation of global companies, and institutional interest are forming a foundation that is still weakly reflected in the price. If the regulatory environment turns out to be favorable, this ve"

This accumulation is supported by large wallets, while the majority of investors remain hesitant after an unstable 2025. Such a discreet but structured movement calls for attention. Is it a simple opportunistic bet or an early reversal signal ?\nIn brief\n- Solana opens 2026 at the top of crypto trends, according to data from the Santiment platform.\n- Despite a 46 % drop over three months, whales massively accumulate SOL.\n- This accumulation concerns several assets linked to the Solana ecosystem, not just the native token.\n- Beyond Solana, 2026 looks like a pivotal year for crypto-TradFi convergence.\nWhales on the lookout : massive Solana accumulation at the start of the year\nAt the very beginning of 2026, data published by the Santiment analytics platform show that Solana is the most discussed crypto topic on social media and in specialized circles, despite triggering a record liquidation.\nOn January 1st, Santiment revealed that many large wallets have made \u201crepeated purchases of 10 Solanas or more\u201d across several assets related to the SOL ecosystem. According to the report, these purchases are not limited to the native token but include several products associated with the ecosystem, although their capitalizations vary.\nAt the same time, the behavioral confidence score measured by the Santiment heuristic tool is around 70%, indicating a \u201cmoderate but steady confidence\u201d among these investors.\nDespite a notable 46 % drop in the SOL price over the past three months, data point to resilient market activity, particularly on the whales\u2019 side. Santiment specifies that liquidity remains strong, enabling these large entities to operate in the market without causing major distortions. The key elements reported by the study include :\n- Repeated purchases of 10 SOL or more, made by high-capacity wallets ;\n- A diversity of Solana assets involved, beyond the native token alone ;\n- A behavioral confidence score around 70 %, reflecting a measured but solid conviction ;\n- Liquidity maintained despite the significant price decline over the quarter.\nThese observations suggest that these investors anticipate a market turnaround or wish to strengthen their strategic positions at price levels deemed attractive. In the absence of an immediate catalyst, this accumulation suggests a long-term vision by these dominant actors.\nA discreet but significant institutional support\nBeyond the specific accumulation on SOL, the trends noted by Santiment at the dawn of this new year point to a global dynamic, at the crossroads of traditional finance and cryptos.\nIn an end-of-year publication, David Duong, head of research at Coinbase, emphasized that \u201c2025 laid the regulatory foundations for wider crypto adoption\u201d. According to him, 2026 should mark an acceleration, notably driven by the rise of spot ETFs, the widespread use of stablecoins in payment systems, and the tokenization of financial assets. These structural changes are progressively integrating traditional finance flows.\nThis convergence between crypto and TradFi could indirectly benefit blockchains like Solana, known for their speed and low transaction costs. Moreover, Warren Buffett\u2019s retirement, an iconic figure of bitcoin skepticism, reignites discussions about generational renewal in investment approaches. Rumors even suggest a more favorable stance towards cryptos from Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s new management, though no official announcement has been made yet.\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

                "body": "Analytics from Nansen present the growth and changes in DeFi space. As per the latest ranking by the company, Solana is ahead in terms of amount of value locked in DeFi with $23.01 billion. After Solana follows BNB Chain ($3.89 billion) Base ($3.29 billion) Ronado ($3.22 billion) and NEAR Protocol ($1.89 billion). The data shows us that both the existing and new players are doing their best to make their mark in on-chain finance.\nDomination of Solana in DeFi\nSolana has surged ahead of the competition, boasting over $23 billion in total value locked, and the reasons are clear. The transactions are extremely quick in the blockchain, and the fees are kept low which has caused it to become a go to for everyone, from day traders to large institutions. What\u2019s particularly impressive is how Solana managed to pull $1.4 billion in revenue this year while keeping nearly 40 million addresses active on the network.\nWith its impressive transaction throughput of thousands of transactions per second and very low transaction fees, Solana provides extreme value to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and yield farming protocols as well. Jupiter and MarginFi for example have staked their claim on Solana and brought much-needed liquidity to the ecosystem, along with Marinade Finance. Regulatory OK for Solana ETFs on a spot basis in late 2025, Solana has successfully evolved from a speculative playground to an institutional platform.\nBNB Chain and Layer-2 Solutions Surges\nBNB Chain, being the second largest network in terms of TVL with 3.89 billion locked shows the longevity of Binance\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. With an ideal combination of accessibility, speed and security, the platform has established itself in this area quickly and successfully. The most recent quarterly data shows that in Q-3 of 2021 BNB Chain has gained ground on its competitors with 4.32 million daily active wallets, and a 35.3% quarter-to-quarter increase in its number of daily transactions to 13.3 million.\nBNB Chain prioritizes stablecoin infrastructure and utility agreements over competition. BNB Chain has become a hub for peer-to-peer and retail commerce transactions with stablecoin volumes topping 124 billion dollars daily. Base\u2019s rise to the third-largest chain by TVL at 3.29 billion validates Layer-2 scaling techniques. Base, backed by Coinbase, has quickly attracted developers and customers wanting Ethereum\u2019s security without massive gas prices.\nMarket Dynamics and Future Outlook\nRonado and NEAR Protocol being ranked among the top 5 highest TVL, some interesting findings can be had with regards to the present competitive spectrum. Although these platforms may not be as recognizable to many users compared to the other networks being listed here, the size and amount of capital that has been invested into these platforms and community is significant. The differential amount of the TVL on these networks indicates, in part, different trends in the DeFi space, where overall growth of DeFi has shown consistent growth.\nEthereum is at the top of all ecosystems in terms of ecosystem value, having a total value locked of over $93 billion. However, the rapid growth of Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks means that there is a promising sociability multi-chain future on the horizon. This diversity reflects both consumers and developers having a compromise of security, speed, low-cost, and maturity of the ecosystem. Competition amongst networks on technological specs, developer tooling, depth of liquidity, regulatory positioning and real-world integration.\nConclusion\nThe Nansen rankings show that blockchain economics has changed to favor networks with unique value propositions. Solana\u2019s $23 billion TVL, BNB Chain\u2019s $3.89 billion, and Base\u2019s $3.29 billion depict robust ecosystems with millions of active users creating actual economic activity. Investors, developers, and users exploring this field should know that decentralized finance is multi-chain. Success will go to those who understand network"

                "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 2, 2026, 16:31 ET \u2014 After-hours\n- The Dow rose 311.99 points, or 0.67%, to 48,383.22; the S&P 500 edged up 0.18% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.02%.\n- Chipmakers and industrials led, while Tesla fell after reporting a second straight annual drop in sales.\n- Traders now turn to next week\u2019s U.S. jobs report and inflation data, with big banks set to kick off earnings season.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 311.99 points, or 0.67%, to 48,383.22 at Friday\u2019s close, snapping a four-day losing streak on the first trading day of 2026. The S&P 500 added 0.18% while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.02%, according to preliminary data. Chip stocks and industrials lifted the Dow, and furniture retailers advanced after the White House said President Donald Trump signed a proclamation delaying planned tariff increases on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities for another year; Tesla slid after reporting a second straight annual fall in sales. Reuters\nThe early split matters because the market is entering January after a third straight year of gains, but investors remain torn over whether 2026 brings a \u201csoft landing\u201d or a sharper slowdown. Friday\u2019s Dow outperformance versus the Nasdaq pointed to rotation into economically sensitive names, not a broad-based risk-on move.\nBond markets kept pressure on rate-sensitive valuations. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose about 4 basis points \u2014 a basis point is 0.01 percentage point \u2014 to around 4.195%, with shorter-dated yields also higher as traders looked ahead to fresh employment data for signals on growth and Federal Reserve policy. Reuters\nIn equities, chip names helped steady the market after a midday wobble. Nvidia and Intel were among the stocks underpinning the rebound, while Caterpillar and Boeing powered much of the Dow\u2019s advance.\nThe broader indexes faced drag from consumer discretionary stocks. Amazon weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and Tesla\u2019s drop followed its update showing annual sales fell for a second year, a rare negative in a sector investors often treat as a growth barometer.\nThe close also extended a theme from late December: the market has struggled to find the seasonal lift traders call the Santa Claus rally, typically the last five trading days of December plus the first two of January. The absence of that bounce has kept attention on macro catalysts, not momentum.\nPolicy risk stayed on the tape. The tariff delay for household-related imports helped lift furniture-linked stocks, but investors said they remain wary of fresh surprises on trade that could reprice inflation expectations and corporate guidance.\nBefore the next session, the focus turns quickly to a dense January calendar. The U.S. employment report due Jan. 9 is expected to show payrolls rose 55,000 in December, based on a Reuters poll, with the unemployment rate at 4.6%; strategists also point to the market\u2019s narrow range near late-October levels \u2014 \u201cThe market is looking for direction,\u201d said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. Reuters\nHow investors read the jobs data matters as much as the headline. A firmer report can push rate-cut expectations out, while a weaker print can revive recession worries even if it increases the odds of easier policy.\nTraders will also be watching inflation, with the U.S. consumer price index due Jan. 13. Fed funds futures \u2014 derivatives that reflect expectations for Fed rate moves \u2014 have recently implied little chance of a cut at the late-January meeting but close to a 50% probability of a quarter-point reduction in March, Reuters reported.\nEarnings season adds another test. JPMorgan is scheduled to report on Jan. 13 along with other major banks that week, while analysts tracked by LSEG IBES are looking for S&P 500 earnings growth to accelerate into 2026 \u2014 a forecast that leaves little room for policy or macro shocks to hit margins or demand."

                "body": "The UK's FTSE 100 ended higher on the first trading session of the year on Friday, after blowing past the 10,000 points mark for the first time on a wave of optimism sweeping global markets. The blue-chip index ended up 0.2%, after capping its strongest yearly performance in 16 years on Wednesday.\n\"(It) is a powerful signal for UK markets, reflecting ongoing confidence in earnings resilience, attractive valuations and the growing appeal of UK equities to international investors at a time when policy headwinds are beginning to ease,\" said Axel Rudolph, senior financial analyst at IG. European benchmarks, along with indexes in Taiwan and South Korea, also hit record highs on Friday, while U.S. stock futures advanced as optimism around the global AI-driven rally and easing policy headwinds lifted risk appetite.\nOn the FTSE 100, the defence and aerospace sector led gains, rising 3.2%. Rolls-Royce jumped 3.6%, Melrose Industries advanced 3.5% and BAE Systems rose 2.2%. Personal goods followed with a 2.1% advance.\nThe two were among the best-performing sectors in 2025. The British benchmark gained nearly 22% in 2025, outperforming Europe's STOXX 600 and the S&P 500 . Its gains largely reflect the diversification that the index offers, with little direct exposure to the artificial intelligence sector.\nCommodity-linked stocks, such as oil firms and miners, are heavyweights on the FTSE 100 and have largely benefited from record metal prices and higher oil prices. Rudolph noted that diversified earnings, strong cash generation and the prospect of a more accommodative Bank of England suggest that the market's outperformance was sustainable even if gains moderate.\nLondon's domestically focused mid-cap index closed down 0.2%. Meanwhile, data from mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society showed UK house prices unexpectedly fell 0.4% in December, leaving annual growth at just 0.6% for 2025, the weakest since April 2024. Construction and materials and real estate stocks fell 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n{{#Source}}{{Source}}{{/Source}}{{#IsBlog}}\n{{Disclaimer}}\n{{/Disclaimer}}"

Together, these factors should continue to underpin the index, even if the path may prove to be less smooth than the post April 2025's advance.\nUK blue-chip companies have demonstrated notable earnings durability despite a challenging backdrop of elevated interest rates, higher financing costs and subdued domestic growth.\nProfit margins have held up better than many had feared, with earnings growth outstripping declines in revenues. This suggests companies have successfully managed costs, improved efficiency or adjusted pricing to protect profitability even as top-line momentum softened.\nProductivity and global exposure support earnings\nEncouraging signs of a productivity recovery are emerging, with incremental improvements in output per worker compared with pre-pandemic levels. These gains may help certain firms maintain competitiveness even in a slower-growth environment.\nFor globally diversified sectors - including energy, mining and multinationals - revenue trends have been more stable, reflecting broad international exposure.\nA weaker British pound has supported earnings by boosting the sterling value of overseas revenues. At the same time AI-driven efficiency improvements are gradually filtering through UK-listed multinationals, helping stabilise margins.\nWhile investor focus in 2025 has largely been on the scale of US technology spending, the FTSE\u2019s more mature sectors - ranging from pharmaceuticals and financial services to industrials - are beginning to realise operational improvements of their own. These efficiency gains are helping to offset cyclical pressures and are laying the foundations for continued earnings momentum in 2026.\nBank of England easing becomes more plausible\nFrom a policy perspective, the BoE appears to have scope to ease without reigniting inflation concerns.\nUK inflation, which climbed to around 3.8% in the latter part of 2025, has shown signs of resuming its downward trend. This provides policymakers with greater flexibility to continue cutting interest rates at a measured pace.\nA gradual loosening of financial conditions would offer a constructive backdrop for equities, particularly interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housebuilders, utilities and banks.\nHistorically, the FTSE 100 has responded well to a \u201cmild Goldilocks\u201d environment characterised by modest growth and gently easing monetary policy.\nValuation discount remains compelling\nValuation concerns appear overstated. The FTSE 100, trading on a price-to-earnings (P/E) of around 14, continues to sit at a notable discount to global peers. By comparison, the S&P 500 trades closer to 25 times earnings, a gap that has persisted despite improving earnings visibility among UK companies.\nRather than signalling structural weakness, this discount for many investors looks like an opportunity. Strong cash generation, attractive dividend yields and robust balance sheets remain defining features of the UK market.\nThe concentration of returns in energy, banking and large pharmaceutical stocks simply reflects where the most durable earnings streams are found, with little evidence to suggest this leadership is nearing exhaustion.\nTechnical and fundamental forces align\nThe FTSE 100 enters 2026 on solid foundations.\nWith the UK autumn budget behind markets and liquidity"

                "body": "Breaching the 10,000 level is largely symbolic and signals growing interest in the UK stock market from international investors.\nThe index is largely divorced from Britain\u2019s economy and is not typically seen as a barometer of economic growth.\nAround 75pc of the FTSE 100\u2019s combined revenues come from overseas, and the recent rise has been largely been driven by factors outside of the UK\u2019s control, such as surging gold prices and growing fears over an AI bubble.\nUnder Reeves, Britain\u2019s economy has been struggling in recent months, with GDP growth flat or negative. Unemployment has also climbed to 5.1pc, a new five-year high.\nSir Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cMeasuring the UK\u2019s economic health by the FTSE 100 alone is ill-advised. Most of the corporate earnings within that index arise in other countries, while the more UK-exposed FTSE 250 continues to lag.\n\u201cUnemployment is rising, retail is struggling, business confidence is at record lows and growth is flat \u2013 this is not a moment for self-congratulation.\n\u201cThe Chancellor should be honest about the reality, face facts and change course.\u201d\nThe point level represents the overall value of the index\u2019s 100 constituent stocks. The index had a value of 1,000 points when it first opened on Jan 3, 1984. Every point change since then reflects how the total market value of those companies has risen or fallen.\nIn monetary terms, the index\u2019s constituents are now collectively worth around \u00a32.57tn.\nDefence and banking boost\nThe FTSE 100 enjoyed a stellar 2025. London\u2019s premier stock market index rose by 21.5pc last year, outperforming the US\u2019s S&P 500 and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600.\nLacking major technology companies, the FTSE 100 has been left out of the AI craze powering Wall Street and has instead been buoyed by rallies in the defence, mining and banking sectors.\nGold prices rose by more than 70pc over the past year, and the FTSE 100\u2019s best-performing stock in 2025, the gold miner Fresnillo, jumped by 447pc. Endeavour Mining, the index\u2019s other gold miner, rose by 178pc \u2013 the third best-performing stock last year."

                "body": "DAX Today, January 02: Opens Above 24,500 on Rate-Cut Optimism\nDAX today opened just above 24,500 as traders returned from holidays to a quiet market. Sentiment leans positive on hopes tied to ECB rate cuts and last year\u2019s Fed easing. Early gains in aerospace, including MTU and Airbus, offset a softer move in FMC. Liquidity is thin, so swings can be sharp. Strong US jobless data could cool rate\u2011cut hopes and cap upside. We track DAX live levels alongside bund yields, the euro, and sector rotation across European stocks.\nOpening snapshot and drivers\nDAX today started slightly higher above 24,500, supported by expectations that ECB rate cuts will aid margins and investment in 2026. The tone matched broader European stocks, with a constructive bias but modest size. For context on the open and market breadth, see Tagesschau\u2019s coverage here.\nPost\u2011holiday volumes remain light, which can exaggerate intraday moves and widen spreads. Traders should avoid chasing gaps and instead focus on clear levels. Handelsblatt reported the index\u2019s start above 24,500 and flagged selective stock action here. Watch microstructure: opening range, tick\u2011by\u2011tick depth, and how quickly bids refresh after dips.\nEarly movers on the index\nAerospace names set the pace, with MTU Aero Engines and Airbus posting early gains. Order backlogs, stable traffic, and potential defense demand support the group. If the euro softens, exporters can see extra tailwind. DAX today often leans on these heavyweights when liquidity is thin, so sustained leadership here would help the broader index hold opening levels.\nFresenius Medical Care edged lower, trimming the early advance. Investors appear selective within healthcare, balancing defensiveness against pricing and cost questions. With quiet news flow, small order imbalances can push moves. We look for confirmation from volumes, options skew, and whether buyers return near prior support after the first hour.\nWhat could sway the session\nResilient US labor signals and firm jobless data could lift yields and temper rate\u2011cut hopes, limiting multiple expansion. That would challenge DAX today if bond proxies fade. We track DAX live versus bund and Treasury moves; a gentle yield drift is fine, but a sharp rise could rotate flows toward value, energy, and banks while pressuring growth pockets.\nA stronger euro can weigh on exporters\u2019 earnings translation, while softer gas and power prices help German industry sentiment. China headlines also matter for autos and machinery. We monitor EUR/USD ranges, front\u2011month European energy prices, and any policy tidbits from the ECB. Together, these inputs can reset risk appetite during the session.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe setup for DAX today is constructive but fragile. An open above 24,500 shows buyers are present, helped by hopes for ECB rate cuts and spillover from last year\u2019s easing. Thin liquidity means we should favor levels over headlines: respect the opening range, track futures basis, and fade stretched spikes. Watch yields and the euro for clues on sector rotation. If aerospace leadership holds and healthcare steadies, the index can build on early gains. A stronger move in US labor data or a jump in yields could cap upside. Keep positions sized modestly, use clear stops, and reassess as volumes normalize later in the week.\nFAQs\nThe index benefited from positive sentiment around ECB rate cuts and last year\u2019s Fed easing, plus early strength in aerospace names like MTU and Airbus. Thin post\u2011holiday liquidity also played a role, as smaller orders can move prices more than usual during the first sessions of the year.\nLower policy rates reduce funding costs, support credit growth, and can lift equity valuations. For exporters, rate cuts that weigh on the euro may help earnings translation. The effect varies by sector: banks, cyclicals, and rate\u2011sensitive growth names often respond differently based on yield curves and credit conditions.\nFocus on the opening range, volume around key levels, and how "

The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $3.78 billion at the midpoint came in 0.8% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.15 per share was 1.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRevenue: $917 million vs analyst estimates of $957.8 million (6.4% year-on-year decline, 4.3% miss)\nAdjusted EPS: $2.15 vs analyst estimates of $2.12 (1.2% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $119 million vs analyst estimates of $118.5 million (13% margin, in line)\nEBITDA guidance for the full year is $490 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $496.2 million\nOperating Margin: 8.2%, up from 5.3% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 12%, up from 7.4% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $2.64 billion\nCompany Overview\nOriginally spun off from Ford Motor Company in 2000, Visteon (NYSE:VC) designs and manufactures cockpit electronics for vehicles, including digital instrument clusters, displays, infotainment systems, and battery management systems.\nRevenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, Visteon\u2019s 8.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. Its growth was slightly above the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Visteon\u2019s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 3.4% over the last two years. Visteon isn\u2019t alone in its struggles as the Automobile Manufacturing industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time.\nThis quarter, Visteon missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 6.4% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $917 million of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.5% over the next 12 months. Although this projection suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage\u2014all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We\u2019ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report.\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nVisteon was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 6% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nOn the plus side, Visteon\u2019s operating margin rose by 7 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage. We\u2019ll take Visteon\u2019s improvement as many Automobile Manufacturing companies saw their margins fall (along with revenue, as mentioned above) because the cycle turned in the wrong direction.\nThis quarter, Visteon generated an operating margin profit margin of 8.2%, up 2.9 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\nEa"

                "body": "Animal health products manufacturer Phibro Animal Health (NASDAQ: PAHC) fell short of the markets revenue expectations in Q1 CY2026, with sales flat year on year at $347.8 million. On the other hand, the company\u2019s outlook for the full year was close to analysts\u2019 estimates with revenue guided to $1.46 billion at the midpoint. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.63 per share was 8.3% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Phibro Animal Health? Find out by accessing our full research report, it\u2019s free for active Edge members.\nPhibro Animal Health (PAHC) Q1 CY2026 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $347.8 million vs analyst estimates of $359.7 million (flat year on year, 3.3% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.63 vs analyst expectations of $0.69 (8.3% miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $61.9 million vs analyst estimates of $60.94 million (17.8% margin, 1.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $2.73 at the midpoint, beating analyst estimates by 3.4%\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $235 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $226.1 million\n- Operating Margin: 11.4%, up from 9.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 10.2%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.51 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a portfolio of approximately 800 product lines serving farmers and veterinarians in 90 countries, Phibro Animal Health (NASDAQ: PAHC) develops, manufactures, and markets health products for livestock and companion animals, including antibacterials, vaccines, nutritional supplements, and mineral additives.\nRevenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Phibro Animal Health grew its sales at a decent 11.9% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Phibro Animal Health\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 18.3% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand recently accelerated.\nThis quarter, Phibro Animal Health\u2019s $347.8 million of revenue was flat year on year, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and suggests the market is forecasting some success for its newer products and services.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nOperating Margin\nPhibro Animal Health was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 8.4% was weak for a healthcare business.\nOn the plus side, Phibro Animal Health\u2019s operating margin rose by 3.1 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. This performance was mostly driven by its recent improvements as the company\u2019s margin has increased by 5.5 percentage points on a two-year basis.\nIn Q1, Phibro Animal Health generated an operating margin profit margin of 11.4%, up 1.8 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nPhibro"

(NYSE:NOW) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nEnterprise workflow management software services provider ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) announced an important deal the day this show was aired, as it announced that it would acquire cybersecurity firm Armis for a $7.5 billion price tag. Throughout 2025, Cramer has maintained that the cybersecurity sector continues to be attractive in the broader software industry as it benefits from national security tailwinds and the growth in data usage stemming from AI. Earlier in the month, Bernstein had maintained a $1,093 share price target for ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and assigned an Overweight rating to the shares. As reports of the merger made rounds in markets ahead of the official announcement and led to weakness in the shares, the financial firm commented that channel checks indicated demand acceleration and the selloff hinted at undervaluation. After the deal was announced, Cramer was unsurprisingly optimistic, given his thoughts surrounding the cybersecurity sector:\n\u201cNo, and this is very important, because, ServiceNow, is in many ways, very important within the organization. Whenever they get in, but they haven\u2019t been strong in something that everybody wants, which is cybersecurity. And this is, I think, integral to the suite, to a platform that you have. ServiceNow going beyond, just a vertical of IT and going to a platform. That\u2019s what everybody is doing. And I think it\u2019ll be important, because the compression of the price-to-earnings multiple for ServiceNow is huge.\u201d\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
