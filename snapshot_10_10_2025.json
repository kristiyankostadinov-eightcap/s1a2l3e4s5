He says the dollar will remain the currency of choice in international trade and finance.\nChahrour says: \u201cIt would be virtually impossible for gold to take on the multifaceted role of the USD in international trade and finance. This probably is a little bit about hedging inflation risk, but if it were primarily about this, I think we should see even larger and broader commodity price changes. So again, I don\u2019t think this is the main thing going on.\n\u201cThis leaves us with central bank reserve demand: Since the supply of gold is fixed in the short term, small changes in demand could lead to large price swings. But these might be temporary.\n\u201cI think the big question is how this is connected, if at all, to record equity prices at the same time. It\u2019s hard to see how investors would be so scared in one dimension and so risk-seeking in another.\u201d"

The stock builds in China limited the downward price pressure we would otherwise expect to see with growing inventories, keeping the Brent crude oil spot prices in a relatively tight range around $68 per barrel (b) in the second and third quarters of 2025.\nWe estimate global petroleum inventories rose by an average of 1.8 million b/d in the second and third quarters in our October Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). Global oil inventories have been growing in 2025 as crude oil production from OPEC+ members and non-OPEC+ producers in North and South America has outpaced global demand growth. Between April and August (the latest estimates we have), growth in China alone averaged 1.1 million b/d. Similar levels of global inventory growth would typically put downward pressure on crude oil prices; however, the price of Brent increased slightly during this period, averaging $68/b in the second quarter (2Q25) and $69/b in 3Q25.\nWe estimate total liquid fuels inventories in non-OECD countries, including China, grew by an average of 0.9 million b/d from January through August 2025. We estimate that on average, 0.9 million b/d of crude oil and condensate was added to oil inventories in China, making up most of our estimated global inventory builds of 1.4 million b/d over the same period.\nChina does not report data on its oil inventories, so we assessed China\u2019s stock growth based on imports, exports, refining, and oil inventory data from third-party and official sources. We estimate the additions to oil inventories in China by balancing crude oil and condensate production, reported by the China National Bureau of Statistics, along with imports, refinery runs, and export data from a collection of ship-tracking and third-party sources. Depending on the source used and assumptions made, the range between different stock build estimates is 0.5 million b/d on average and can be as large as 1.1 million b/d, so we take an average for this comparison. Although we know some portion of China\u2019s refinery capacity can utilize heavy fuel oil, we assume refinery run numbers are strictly crude oil for our estimates. In addition, since public reports that China directed its National Oil Companies to add barrels of oil to inventories, we assume both commercial and official government storage facilities can be considered as part of their strategic inventory stockpile.\nAlthough our estimates are based on limited information, they support the idea that inventory growth in China was not available for trade on the global market, supporting crude oil prices.\nThe numerous geopolitical risks, along with shifting global oil trade flows and increased use of shadow tanker fleets due to sanctions, increase the uncertainty around estimating global oil balances in our STEO. Although we estimate global oil inventory builds to accelerate in our STEO, averaging 2.2 million b/d on from the fourth quarter of 2025 through 2026, the portion of this estimate that will show up in visible oil inventories and influence oil prices remains uncertain.\nWe currently forecast that Brent crude oil prices will fall from an average of $68/b in September to an average of $52/b in the first quarter of 2026, when global oil inventory builds are estimated to be at their peak in our STEO. If China continues to add to oil inventories over the forecast at a rate similar to the 0.9 million b/d from January through August of this year, crude oil prices could remain higher than our forecast. Conversely, a slowdown in China\u2019s oil inventory builds would likely put downward pressure on oil prices as more oil shows up in visible oil inventory data.\nPrincipal contributors: Sean Hill, Jonathan Russo"

OPEC serves as a crucial organization in the energy sector, as it brings together some of the most oil-rich countries in the world. In a world that is in a constant state of evolution, particularly in the energy sector, which has been embroiled in the transition away from traditional forms of energy generation. OPEC serves as the last major organization representing the export of crucial petroleum.\nOPEC countries see a significant rise in output for September, underscoring the importance of the conventional energy sector\nThe nations that form part of OPEC are among the largest traditional energy producers in the world. Oil remains a vital cornerstone of the energy sector, and OPEC serves as the largest conglomerate of countries that export vast amounts of oil to the rest of the world.\nIn a recent survey, industry analysts reported that following an agreement between OPEC nations, output in the oil sector rose sharply in September. The survey reports OPEC nations pumped 28.40 million barrels per day last month, up 330,000 bpd from August\u2019s revised total.\nThe cornerstone members of OPEC are the two largest oil-rich countries in the world, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Those two cornerstone countries saw the largest increase among the nations in OPEC. Saudi Arabia, in particular, needs to foster a more friendly business environment, especially with the new US administration.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is, of course, the keystone of OPEC. Saudi Arabia has had the distinction of remaining stable through all the escalating tumult of recent decades, reliably pumping out its roughly 10 million barrels a day like Bossy the cow in America\u2019s oil import barn.\u201d \u2013 James Howard Kunstler, American writer and social critic\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries unwinds a second layer of cuts ahead of plan\nThe rise in output comes after OPEC and its allies, which include Russia, opted to accelerate their output hikes starting in October as they unwind the second layer of cuts way ahead of schedule. At the same time, certain member states have been tasked with extra cuts to compensate for earlier overproduction.\nUnder an agreement governed by OPEC covering September output, states that Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE were to raise output by 415,000 bpd before the effect of compensation cuts totalling 170,000 bpd for Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE.\nNations like the United States and China, which have recently seen 21 GW of coal plants being commissioned during the first half of the year, need to engage with the nations that form OPEC to ensure a smooth operational process for global trade.\n\u201cIf you look \u2013 look at \u2013 I mean, look at what\u2019s going on with your gasoline prices. They\u2019re going to go to $5, $6, $7 and we don\u2019t have anybody in Washington that calls OPEC and says, \u2018Fellas, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re not going to do it anymore.\u201d \u2013 United States President Donald Trump\nThe oil industry remains a vital source of energy generation for the foreseeable future\nWhat has become evidently clear in the past few years is that the current trend of countries transitioning to the renewable energy sector can not reduce the importance that the oil industry plays in the global energy sector. As nations of the world approach their respective regulatory bodies seeking extensions to allow the continuation of coal and oil production into the foreseeable future. OPEC has significant power in the energy sector in determining the overall outlook for the oil sector, and needs to work cohesively with the nations outside the organization\u2019s purview."

That jump marks one of the larger single-week gains seen in recent months and prompted renewed discussion about supply-and-demand imbalances.\nA year ago, total U.S. crude inventories were slightly higher at 422.7 million barrels, suggesting production and storage patterns remain relatively stable despite ongoing market volatility.\nCushing Hub Sees Decline in Storage\nWhile the nation\u2019s overall stockpile expanded, Oklahoma\u2019s key oil storage site saw a decline.\nThe EIA report shows crude held at the Cushing Hub \u2014 often referred to as the \u201cpipeline crossroads of the world\u201d \u2014 fell by 800,000 barrels over the same period.\nCushing storage decreased from 33.4 million barrels on September 26 to 32.6 million barrels by October 3. Analysts say that dip could reflect higher refinery demand or ongoing pipeline deliveries from Oklahoma to Gulf Coast export terminals.\nCushing\u2019s fluctuations often influence benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing, meaning even small declines can ripple through futures markets.\nGasoline Stocks Drop as Crude Climbs\nWhile crude supplies rose, gasoline inventories declined, signaling tighter fuel availability.\nThe EIA data showed U.S. gasoline stocks fell from 220.7 million barrels to 219.1 million barrels during the same period \u2014 a decrease of 1.6 million barrels.\nEnergy experts say that contrast between rising crude supplies and shrinking fuel reserves could point to ongoing refinery adjustments or export demand.\nTraders continue to monitor how these shifts might influence fall fuel prices, which have remained volatile as global production stabilizes and U.S. demand eases post-summer.\nEnergy Markets Watch for Next Report\nMarket analysts now wait for next week\u2019s EIA report to see whether these trends continue.\nIf national inventories keep climbing while Cushing levels fall, Oklahoma\u2019s storage hub could once again become a key indicator of short-term energy trends.\nFor now, investors are watching both refinery utilization rates and export figures to assess whether the recent stock increases represent a temporary build-up or a longer-term shift in supply patterns."

The preliminary reading of the U-Mich Consumer Sentiment report will be in the spotlight later on Friday.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will name a new Prime Minister by Friday evening, per the Guardian. France\u2019s longstanding political crisis deepened this week when the Prime Minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, resigned after 27 days in office. \"In France, turmoil following the resignation of Prime Minister Lecornu has undermined EUR sentiment,\" said Kieran Williams, head of Asia FX at InTouch Capital Markets.\nAcross the pond, the US government shutdown entered its tenth day on Friday as the Senate rejected funding bills from lawmakers that had the potential to bring the shutdown to an end. The shutdown has caused a delay in official US economic data, which complicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) decision-making on interest rates. Concerns over a prolonged US federal shutdown could undermine the Greenback and create a tailwind for the major pair.\nNew York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday that he would be comfortable with cutting interest rates again. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly noted on Friday that inflation has come in much less than she had feared, adding that the US central bank is projecting additional cuts in risk management.\nMoney markets are currently pricing in a 95% probability of the central bank cutting its key interest rate again in the October policy meeting, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly"

The euro struggled to hold the 1.1600 threshold amid renewed risk aversion, weak German data, and diverging central bank trajectories between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). Traders moved decisively toward the greenback as the U.S. government shutdown entered its ninth day, lifting safe-haven demand and adding pressure to euro bulls.\nFrench Political Uncertainty Fuels Market Volatility\nThe political crisis in France has become a major destabilizing force for the euro. Following the temporary resignation of Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, President Emmanuel Macron urged him to remain in office for 48 more hours to stabilize parliament and avoid a snap election. However, with no parliamentary majority and debt expectations climbing to 116.7% of GDP in 2026\u2014up from 113.1% in 2024\u2014France\u2019s fiscal credibility is under renewed scrutiny. Analysts at ING Bank warned that the probability of early elections \u201chas increased significantly,\u201d which could deepen uncertainty without resolving the country\u2019s structural gridlock. Bond markets echoed this anxiety: French 10-year yields rose to 3.41%, widening the spread over German bunds to 68 basis points, the highest since March.\nGermany\u2019s Industrial Recession Weighs on the Eurozone\nAcross the bloc, economic data reinforced the euro\u2019s vulnerability. Germany\u2019s industrial production fell 4.3% month-over-month in August, with exports slipping 0.5% and imports down 1.8%, signaling waning global demand. While the trade surplus expanded to \u20ac17.2 billion, the improvement came from contracting imports rather than stronger exports\u2014a clear indicator of domestic weakness. Combined with Eurozone GDP growth at just 0.1% q/q, investors see little macro justification for aggressive euro buying. The ECB minutes released Thursday showed no urgency to accelerate rate cuts but confirmed that policymakers remain divided, with several members cautioning against prolonged tightening amid disinflationary risks.\nDollar Strength and Fed Tone Keep Pressure on EUR/USD\nThe U.S. dollar index (DXY) rose sharply to 99.00, its highest since July, as traders favored the greenback on safe-haven flows and relatively stronger U.S. data. Fed New York President John Williams reiterated that the central bank is ready to support the labor market while monitoring inflation, reinforcing expectations of two more rate cuts before year-end. 10-year U.S. Treasury yields stabilized around 4.10%, with shorter maturities holding near 3.95%, sustaining the dollar\u2019s carry advantage. Meanwhile, the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 50.2, narrowly expanding for the first time in five months, while consumer confidence held firm at 104.6, underscoring resilience in U.S. domestic demand compared with Europe\u2019s stagnation.\nTechnical Breakdown Shows Downside Bias Toward 1.1520\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains entrenched in a bearish structure. The pair trades below the 20-day moving average (1.1650) and 50-day average (1.1740), confirming downward momentum. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 41, showing room for further downside before oversold conditions emerge. Analysts identify immediate support at 1.1580, followed by 1.1520 and 1.1440, while resistance sits at 1.1680\u20131.1740. The MACD continues to slope negatively, reinforcing bearish momentum. A daily close below 1.1570 could trigger a deeper move toward 1.1500, marking the lowest since early August.\nECB vs. Fed Divergence Widens as"

                "body": "Most Read: AUD/USD Forecast: Navigating US Government Shutdown & Technical Signals\nEUR/USD continued its slide this morning but is trading flat on the day.\nYesterday's daily candle close though has broken a long-tern ascending trendline and sets the pair up for a potential move lower. There is a caveat however, the fundamental picture and technical picture are flashing mixed signals.\nEUR/USD Paints a Mixed Picture\nEUR/USD seemed poised to test the 1.2000 psychological level heading into the Federal Reserve meeting on September 17. After the meeting the fundamental factors such as monetary policy still seemed to support the idea as well.\nMany viewed the Federal Reserve meeting and Fed Chair Powell's speech as dovish in nature. However, the fact that the Fed only saw one rate cut in 2026 and 2027 did signal to me that we could see a bit of a reaction in the US dollar.\nSuch a reaction did materialize with the US Dollar Index (DXY) rallying in the 3 days after the FOMC meeting. Since then the DXY has continued its impressive rise and this in part is down to the Fed meeting as well as the US Government shutdown. The lack of high impact data from the US has actually benefitted the greenback.\nNow the question is will the greenback be able to hold onto its gains once the US government shutdown ends? This question may hold the key to the EUR/USD technical setup below.\nTechnical Analysis - EUR/USD\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD has broken the key confluence level which rests around the 1.16300 area.\nIn doing so the pair saw a daily candle close below the medium-term ascending trendline and hinting at a potential change in trend.\nThe pair is also on course for a fourth successive day of declines as price is current being held back by the 100-day MA which rests at 1.1633.\nThe trendline break hints at a move lower toward the 1.14000 handle and potentially a deeper pullback all the way down to 1.1058 handle.\nThe problem with this setup though is the fundamental picture is at odds with this outlook especially when the US government shutdown ends.\nThus the move may not play out smoothly but there is definitely a potential opportunity to keep an eye on.\nThe one concern for now is the period-14 RSI which is currently in oversold territory on the daily timeframe. This could lead to a short-term bounce toward the most recent swing high at 1.1740 or potentially the 50-day MA at 1.1691 before continuing on its downward path.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart, October 9, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nClient Sentiment Data - EUR/USD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are Short on the EUR/USD with 56% of traders Net-Short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are Short means EUR/USD could rise in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

The pair may appreciate as the Pound Sterling (GBP) may gain ground amid cautious sentiment surrounding the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy stance.\nThe BoE policymaker Catherine Mann said on Thursday that the monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer to create an environment conducive to growth. Mann also added that \" Inflation remains persistent and the outlook for growth remains modest,\" per Reuters.\nUK Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said in a letter shared by the finance ministry on Wednesday that the administration would not permit agencies to use emergency funds to fund pay rises, aiming to restrict the wage spiral. \u201cThis prudent but tough approach to public spending is what will help build a stable economy,\" Murray added.\nHowever, the GBP/USD pair may further lose ground as the US Dollar (USD) could receive further support from increased risk aversion, driven by the ongoing government shutdown. The US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the government shutdown.\nHowever, the Greenback may struggle due to prevailing dovish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy outlook. Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Friday that inflation has come in much less than she had feared. Daly further stated that the US central bank is projecting additional cuts in risk management.\nFed Governor Michael Barr said that the current outlook poses challenges for judging the stance of monetary policy and deciding the right path forward. Barr also noted that the Fed's rate cut in September was appropriate, and the current policy rate is still modestly restrictive. He added that it's hard to judge at this point whether the federal government shutdown will leave an imprint on the overall economy.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

The drop mirrors the broad U.S. dollar rally, with the Dollar Index (DXY) surging to 99.51, its highest in nine weeks, as investors rotate toward the greenback amid global risk aversion and renewed fiscal concerns in the United Kingdom. Hedge funds are now increasing net long positions on the dollar into year-end, expecting monetary divergence between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve to deepen.\nFiscal Caution in Focus as Reeves\u2019 Budget Looms Over Sterling\nSterling\u2019s decline is being amplified by domestic concerns ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 first full budget on November 26. Markets expect a package centered on fiscal tightening, with projections for \u00a318\u201320 billion in additional taxes and strict spending limits aimed at reducing the UK\u2019s deficit to below 3.5% of GDP by FY2026. Investors fear this approach could choke already-stagnant growth. The UK\u2019s latest PMI Services reading slipped to 50.3, barely above contraction, while manufacturing output shrank 2.2% YoY, the third consecutive monthly drop. Consumer confidence remains fragile, and wage growth\u2014previously the BoE\u2019s inflation driver\u2014has cooled to 6.1% YoY, its weakest since 2023. The pound\u2019s trajectory reflects investors\u2019 skepticism that Reeves\u2019 policies will sustain momentum in an economy still bruised by weak exports and post-Brexit supply frictions.\nBank of England Confronts Inflation Stagnation at 4%\nInflation remains the BoE\u2019s main constraint. The headline CPI is stuck at 4.0%, double the central bank\u2019s target, and core inflation at 3.6% continues to erode purchasing power. BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill reaffirmed this week that policymakers \u201cmust maintain a conservative bias\u201d and avoid premature easing. Markets are pricing in the first rate cut only by April 2026, followed by another 25 bps reduction by year-end. Meanwhile, the 2-year Gilt yield hovers near 4.23%, reflecting investors\u2019 uncertainty about the pace of disinflation. The monetary backdrop thus provides little immediate support for GBP/USD, which remains vulnerable to U.S. Treasury yield strength.\nU.S. Dollar Strength Amplified by Fed Messaging and Shutdown Delays\nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. dollar\u2019s surge has been reinforced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious tone and the absence of fresh economic data due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown (Day 9). The FOMC September minutes revealed near unanimity for another 25 bps rate cut, but policymakers emphasized a data-dependent approach. Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s pre-recorded speech avoided direct policy signals, yet New York Fed President John Williams reaffirmed that the Fed \u201chas room to hold rates restrictive if inflation stabilizes above 2%.\u201d The resulting rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.62% strengthened dollar demand, pressuring GBP/USD further.\nTechnical Breakdown: Cable Targets 1.3150 as Sellers Dominate\nThe technical landscape confirms bearish control over GBP/USD. The pair has broken below its multi-month trendline, extending losses toward a key support zone between 1.3330 and 1.3350. With the 14-day RSI at 42.5, momentum remains negative, signaling potential continuation toward 1.3150, the May and August lows, aligned with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). On the upside, buyers face strong resistance at 1.3480, coinciding with the 50-day SMA, followed by 1.3600, where the prior rally failed in mid-September.

I had questioned whether the likely new prime minister would truly have as much influence over the Bank of Japan (BOJ) as markets feared. Already, we\u2019re seeing some of her campaign rhetoric being walked back, with Sanae Takaichi stating she is not in favour of an excessively weak yen. Perhaps more importantly, she said there is no immediate need to revise how the government and the BOJ approach policy \u2014 which, to me, gives the BOJ a green light to hike once this year.\nThe Japanese yen rose against all major currencies except the US dollar. Yesterday I noted early signs of fading momentum across yen crosses, and on Thursday we saw more compelling evidence of at least a pause \u2014 if not a near-term reversal. GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY formed bearish engulfing candles, NZD/JPY posted a bearish outside day, and shooting star patterns appeared on AUD/JPY and CAD/JPY. CHF/JPY went a step further, forming a three-bar reversal known as a morning star \u2014 the third candle of which was a bearish engulfing day. This may not trigger a deep pullback against this week\u2019s rally, but it does serve as a clear warning to bulls in the near term.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe daily chart shows an explosive move higher on AUD/JPY, though the shooting star candle just below 101 warns of near-term weakness. On the 1-hour chart, a broken trendline and emerging bear flag pattern highlight potential downside risks.\nThe key level to watch is the 100 handle. A break beneath it would signal a deeper retracement, bringing the January high and high-volume node near 99.17 into focus. Conversely, if 100 holds as support, AUD/JPY bulls may attempt one final push through 101 before momentum fades.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar Bears Eye 200-day EMA\nThe Australian dollar has once again failed to clear the July high, reaffirming it as a key resistance level. Tuesday\u2019s bearish engulfing candle signalled renewed downside momentum from the 0.67 handle, bringing a move back towards 0.65 \u2013 near the 200-day EMA at 0.6492 \u2013 into focus.\nThursday\u2019s bearish outside day has put AUD/USD bears within striking distance of the 0.6520 low. With the daily RSI (2) confirming the downside move and not yet oversold, the bias remains for a break beneath 0.6520 and a potential retest of the 200-day EMA support zone.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: 1-Hour Chart\nAnother surge in US dollar strength after the US open is evident on the 1-hour AUD/USD chart, with the Australian dollar sliding 1% within three hours. However, the 1-hour RSI (2) has reached oversold territory and formed a mild bullish divergence after the sharp drop, suggesting the potential for a short-term bounce.\nAny recovery may simply allow Australian dollar bears to seek a lower high within Thursday\u2019s range, improving risk-to-reward potential for a continuation lower towards the 0.65 handle.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nKey Economic Events for T"

The Aussie gives up its early gains as the Greenback recovers, supported by a rebound in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which hovers near a two-month high around 99.50.\nThe corrective move in the US Dollar following the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes appears to have faded. Despite signals suggesting further rate cuts later this year, the Greenback remains underpinned by renewed risk aversion and profit-taking across equity markets.\nAccording to Bloomberg, several funds in Europe and Asia continue to bet on sustained US Dollar strength through year-end, increasing bearish option positions on the Euro and Japanese Yen. These trades reflect a defensive positioning amid recent weakness in US Equities.\nIn Australia, attention turns to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock, who is scheduled to speak at 22:00 GMT. Her remarks could provide fresh clues about the monetary policy outlook. The RBA recently kept its cash rate unchanged at 3.60%, while noting that disinflation remains incomplete.\nData from the University of Melbourne showed that one-year Consumer Inflation Expectations rose to 4.8% in October from 4.7% in September, suggesting that price pressures persist. This could encourage the RBA to maintain a cautious or even slightly hawkish tone at its next meeting.\nAgainst this backdrop, the AUD/USD pair remains fragile in the short term, with direction likely to depend on Governor Bullock\u2019s comments and the broader trend of the US Dollar.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

FOMC September meeting minutes revealed that most policymakers urged a 25 bps rate cut with a cautious but dovish tone. Markets interpreted this as a confirmation for further easing before year-end, putting pressure on the US dollar.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about automated forex trading? Check our detailed guide-\nHowever, Japan\u2019s shifting political scenario dominated the yen\u2019s trajectory following the surprise victory of Sanae Takaichi in the LDP leadership race. This sparked the odds of a more expansionary fiscal policy, like ex-Prime Minister Abe\u2019s economic policies. As a result, the investors have trimmed the bets on near-term Bank of Japan tightening.\nTakaichi\u2019s policy stance suggests continuity of the existing agenda, with markets anticipating additional fiscal stimulus that could delay the BoJ\u2019s rate normalization plans. Despite this, Japan\u2019s inflation has remained stubbornly above 2% for three years, keeping hopes of a rate hike alive this year.\nThe dovish expectations of BoJ with a politically uncertain environment heavily weighed on the yen before posting a mild recovery in the Asian session on Friday. The Japanese currency found support from safe-haven demand as equities slid, while officials warned of intervention in case of an aggressive one-sided move of yen. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday, \u201cWe are currently seeing one-sided and rapid movements in the market\u2026 The government will carefully assess any excessive or disorderly movements.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the US dollar remains broadly strong amid relative economic resilience and safe-haven demand from ongoing political turmoil in Japan and Europe. The Dollar Index (DXY) marked a fresh 2-month top on Thursday despite traders betting on two Fed rate cuts this year. The continued government shutdown for the second week adds more to the uncertainty. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recalled the staff to complete the September consumer inflation data, reassuring investors that the data will be released before the Fed\u2019s October meeting.\nThe USD/JPY pair remains upward as the yen struggles with policy divergence and political instability. However, the bullish momentum could see a setback amid intervention risks as an ex-official said that the government intervention would become evident if the price hits 160.00.\nUSD/JPY Key Events Ahead\n- FOMC member Daly speaks\n- FOMC member Musalem speaks\n- Prelim UoM Consumer Sentiment\n- Prelim UoM Inflation Expectations\nConsumer sentiment data remains essential today as investors are cautious when gauging business activity without primary data.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook: Correction Before Upside\nThe USD/JPY 4-hour chart shows signs of correction as the RSI remains in the extreme overbought region. The pair has been off the highs, looking to test the 20-period MA around 152.20. Finding acceptance below it could push the price down to the resistance-turned-support around 150.00. A big up gap formed last Friday shows the probability of a deeper correction towards 147.50 to fill the gap.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about forex signals?

                "body": "Japanese Yen sticks to recovery gains against retreating USD amid intervention fears\n- The Japanese Yen strengthened following some verbal intervention from Japanese authorities.\n- The USD pulls back from an over two-month high and further exerts pressure on USD/JPY.\n- Any meaningful JPY appreciation seems elusive in the wake of the fiscal outlook in Japan.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) sticks to its modest intraday recovery gains in the wake of some verbal intervention from Japan's Finance Minister Kato earlier this Friday. Moreover, bets for another interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) this year, along with the cautious market mood, underpin the safe-haven JPY. Apart from this, a modest US Dollar (USD) downtick drags the USD/JPY pair away from its highest level since February 13, touched earlier today, and closer to mid-152.00s.\nMeanwhile, investors seem convinced that Japan's first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, expansive fiscal policies could further delay the BoJ's tightening plan. This has been a key factor behind the JPY's slump since the beginning of the current week, which, in turn, might hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the JPY has bottomed out against its American counterpart.\nJapanese Yen attracts some buyers following verbal intervention from authorities\n- Concerns over Japan\u2019s fiscal health grew, and expectations for an immediate interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan dimmed after Sanae Takaichi's surprise win in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership race last Saturday. The outcome puts her on course to become the country's first female Prime Minister and fueled speculations about more expansionary fiscal policy.\n- Takaichi is seen as a supporter of the former Premier Shinzo Abe's economic policies, who advocated for heavy spending and monetary stimulus to support the Japanese economy. Takaichi is also expected to oppose any further policy tightening by the BoJ, which, in turn, has been a key factor behind the Japanese Yen's broad underperformance since the start of the current week.\n- Meanwhile, inflation in Japan has stayed at or above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for more than three years, and the economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in the three months through June. Moreover, Takaichi's economic advisors \u2013 such as Etsuro Honda and Takuji Aida \u2013 were quoted as saying that Japan's new PM would probably tolerate another rate hike either in December or in January.\n- Furthermore, Takaichi said that she did not want to trigger excessive declines in the domestic currency. Moreover, Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday that authorities will thoroughly monitor for excessive fluctuations and disorderly movements in the forex market. Kato added that it\u2019s important for currencies to move in a stable manner, reflecting fundamentals.\n- This, in turn, provides some respite to the JPY bulls during the Asian session on Friday. Apart from this, the cautious tone around the Asian equity markets assists the safe-haven JPY to recover slightly from its lowest level since February 13, touched against a retreating US Dollar during the Asian session this Friday.\n- The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, shot to over a two-month peak on Thursday amid the ongoing political turmoil in Japan and France. The USD bulls seem unaffected by rising bets for two more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year and concerns that a prolonged US government shutdown could affect the economic performance.\n- The government shutdown is now in its second week amid few signs of progress toward a deal to advance funding bills, with the Senate rejecting motions to advance competing bills for the seventh time on Thursday. The Senate will not hold any further votes, and the shutdown will extend until at least next week, when the upper chamber is expecte"

The pair gained around 0.5% on Thursday as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) faced challenges amid lower crude Oil prices.\nLower Oil prices put downward pressure on the CAD as Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price is trading around $61.20 per barrel at the time of writing. Oil prices came under pressure as geopolitical risk premiums declined following the recent agreement between Israel and Hamas on the first phase of a ceasefire plan.\nThe USD/CAD pair inches lower as the US Dollar (USD) halts its four-day winning streak. However, the pair may further appreciate as the Greenback gains ground amid increased risk aversion, driven by the ongoing government shutdown. The US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the government shutdown on Friday.\nHowever, the Greenback may face challenges due to prevailing dovish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy outlook. Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Friday that inflation has come in much less than she had feared. Daly further stated that the US central bank is projecting additional cuts in risk management.\nFed Governor Michael Barr said that the current outlook poses challenges for judging the stance of monetary policy and deciding the right path forward. Barr also noted that the Fed rate cut in September was appropriate and the current policy rate is still modestly restrictive. He added that it's hard to judge at this point whether the federal government shutdown will leave an imprint on the overall economy.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead centr"

                "body": "USD/CAD Key Points\n- Despite this week\u2019s high-profile meeting between US President Trump and Canadian PM Carney, US tariffs on Canada remain unresolved.\n- Canada\u2019s jobs report tomorrow is expected to show an addition of about 3K net jobs and an uptick in unemployment to 7.2%.\n- USD/CAD is catching a bid so far today, and a close above the 200-day moving average would go a long way toward confirming a renewed rally.\nThere are always multiple fundamental crosswinds to navigate with any currency pair, but USD/CAD\u2019s outlook is particularly fraught at the moment.\nIn addition to the no-end-in-sight US government shutdown, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Trump met to discuss tariffs earlier in the week\u2026with no immediate resolution. The readout from the meeting was positive, with Trump opining that \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat people fairly. We\u2019re going especially treat Canada fairly\u201d and predicting that \u201cThe people of Canada will love us again.\u201d\nFor Canadians in beleaguered industries like autos, steel, and lumber, it\u2019s more a case of \u201cTariffs and trade restrictions may break my economy, but words will never help me.\u201d\nWhile the US government shutdown has put a hold on most major US data, Canada has no such issues, and tomorrow\u2019s jobs report is expected to show an addition of about 3K net jobs and an uptick in unemployment to 7.2% in The Great White North. After two straight months of declines totalling more than -100K jobs, a positive employment figure out of Canada could reassure traders that are increasingly betting on another interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada later this month (~60% discounted per Bloomberg data).\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis: USD/CAD Daily Chart\nSource: StoneX, TradingView\nTurning our attention to the technicals, USD/CAD is broadly holding steady near the 1.40 handle, where it has spent the last week consolidating after hitting its highest level since May. The pair is catching a bid so far today, and a close above the 200-day moving average would go a long way toward confirming a renewed rally toward the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the H1 swoon at 1.4015 and, in time, potentially the 50% Fibonacci retracement in the mid-1.4100s.\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis: USD/CAD Hourly Chart\nSource: StoneX, TradingView\nZooming in to the hourly chart, USD/CAD\u2019s near-term breakout looks more impressive. As long as the pair can hold above previous resistance in the 1.3980-90 zone for the rest of the day, the near-term technical outlook will remain positive, especially if a third straight negative jobs reading cements a BOC rate cut before Halloween.\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\nCheck out Matt\u2019s Daily Market Update videos on YouTube and be sure to follow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX"

The US dollar keeps climbing as investors flock to safer assets\u2014driven by political worries in France and hints of looser policy in Japan. A decisive move above USD/CAD\u2019s resistance at 1.3977 added even more weight. Plus, oil\u2019s 1.8% decline\u2014spurred by hopes for a Gaza ceasefire\u2014hasn\u2019t helped, since oil exports are make-or-break for Canada\u2019s economy. Investors are now eyeing Friday\u2019s jobs report, with expectations of slow growth and a higher jobless rate. Odds of a Bank of Canada interest rate cut at its October 29 meeting have shot up to 64%, prompting traders to rethink where the currency and policy head next.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency swings reflect shifting global priorities.\nThe drop in the Canadian dollar signals that investors are feeling wary about Canada\u2019s prospects as appetite for safe-haven assets gains strength. Markets increasingly expect the Bank of Canada to turn dovish, especially as rising bond yields mirror movements in US Treasuries. With oil staying weak, commodity-linked currencies like the loonie could stay under pressure\u2014particularly if a potential rate cut moves closer.\nThe bigger picture: Currencies mirror global economic uncertainty.\nThe double whammy of a stronger US dollar and weaker oil prices shows just how tightly linked global markets are these days. International political and monetary shifts are amplifying every move, from Japan\u2019s policy signals to Europe\u2019s unrest. The swift drop in the Canadian dollar highlights how quickly global ripples can hit markets and everyday business across Canada.\nYou now have the chance to back Prospero.ai: the award-winning AI platform with trading signals that have outperformed the S&P 500 by 67% over the past four years.\nProspero.ai is embedding itself in retail investors\u2019 routine.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair dipped slightly on Thursday, trading around 204.40, a 0.1% drop following a four-day upward streak. This decrease came amid the Bank of England facing challenges with inflation and growth, with experts calling for cautious or restrictive monetary policies.\nIn Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party leadership race was won by Sanae Takaichi, affecting the Yen. Her pro-stimulus views might influence the Bank of Japan to delay raising rates further, possibly shifting expectations for policy changes to December.\nEconomic Statistics in Japan\nJapanese economic statistics are not in favour of quick monetary changes. August data showed a 1.5% increase in Nominal Cash Earnings, below the forecasted 4.1%, and an eighth consecutive month of Real Wages dropping by 1.4%. These figures challenge tighter monetary policies as Japan deals with inflation from a weak Yen.\nEconomic advisor Etsuro Honda suggested the Bank of Japan remain cautious with interest rates to support economic recovery. Despite Thursday\u2019s slight decrease, GBP/JPY stays near its yearly high of 205.33, driven by the differing monetary strategies of the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.\nThe heatmap shows the British Pound\u2019s performance against major currencies. The strongest gain was against the New Zealand Dollar, while GBP/JPY saw a minor drop.\nTrading Opportunities and Strategies\nThe significant difference in policy between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) suggests this minor dip in GBP/JPY is likely a buying opportunity. The BoE is committed to fighting inflation, while the new leadership in Japan favors more stimulus, which should keep pushing the currency pair higher. We should view the current level around 204.40 as a potential entry point for bullish positions.\nWe have seen this kind of policy conflict before, and it consistently benefits the higher-yielding currency. Looking back to the 2022-2024 period, UK inflation remained stubbornly high, forcing the BoE to hold its policy rate at 5.25% for many months even as growth concerns emerged. This historical precedent supports the view that MPC member Catherine Mann\u2019s \u201crestrictive for longer\u201d stance will likely dominate BoE policy through the end of 2025.\nOn the other side, the yen\u2019s weakness is reinforced by Japan\u2019s ongoing struggle with wage growth. The reported 1.4% annual decline in real wages is not a new problem; we saw a similar, sustained period of negative real wage growth that lasted for over two years through mid-2024. This makes it extremely difficult for the BoJ to raise interest rates, validating expectations that their upcoming October meeting will result in no change.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook makes buying GBP/JPY call options an attractive strategy over the next few weeks. One could consider November or December expiration dates with a strike price just above the yearly high, perhaps around 206.00. This approach allows us to profit from the expected upward trend while strictly defining our maximum risk to the premium paid for the options.\nA more conservative strategy would be to use a bull call spread. This involves buying a call option at a lower strike, like 205.00, and simultaneously selling another call at a higher strike, such as 207.00. This significantly reduces the initial cost of the trade, making it a capital-efficient way to bet on a steady, moderate rise in the pair.\nWhile the fundamental direction seems clear, the division within the BoE creates a risk of volatility. Any surprisingly soft statements from BoE officials could cause a temporary drop in the pair. Using options helps to manage this risk by providing a position with a known and limited downside."

                "body": "GBP/JPY retreats further from YTD peak as verbal intervention aids JPY; holds above 203.00\n- GBP/JPY extends this week\u2019s retracement slide from its highest level since July 2024.\n- Some verbal intervention provides a boost to the JPY and exerts pressure on spot prices.\n- The BoJ uncertainty and reduced bets for more BoE rate cuts could support the cross.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts some follow-through selling for the second consecutive day on Friday and retreats further from its highest level since July 2024, around the 205.30 region touched earlier this week. Spot prices currently trade around the 203.25 area, down 0.20% for the day, though remain on track to register strong weekly gains amid concerns about the fiscal outlook in Japan.\nSanae Takaichi's surprise win in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership race last Saturday puts her on course to become the country's first female Prime Minister and fueled speculations about more expansionary fiscal policy. This, in turn, tempered expectations for an immediate interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which, in turn, has been weighing heavily on the Japanese Yen (JPY) since the beginning of the current week.\nHowever, Takaichi said that she did not want to trigger excessive declines in the JPY. This, along with some verbal intervention from Japan's Finance Minister Kato, provides some respite to the JPY bulls and exerts some downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross. In fact, Kato said that it\u2019s important for currencies to move in a stable manner, and authorities will thoroughly monitor for excessive fluctuations and disorderly movements in the forex market.\nMeanwhile, Takaichi's economic advisors \u2013 such as Etsuro Honda and Takuji Aida \u2013 were quoted as saying that Japan's new PM would probably tolerate another rate hike either in December or in January. Moreover, inflation in Japan has stayed at or above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for more than three years, and the economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in the three months through June. This keeps the door open for another BoJ rate hike and benefits the JPY.\nApart from this, the cautious market mood turns out to be another factor underpinning the safe-haven JPY and weighing on the GBP/JPY cross. The downside, however, seems limited amid expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will keep interest rates on hold at 4% for the rest of this year as signs of faster inflation and a more resilient economy reduce the case for more easing. This could underpin the British Pound (GBP) and support the currency pair.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

After four consecutive days of gains, the British Pound (GBP) takes a breather against the Japanese Yen (JPY).\nIn the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) remains caught between persistent inflation and slowing growth. Huw Pill, the BoE\u2019s Chief Economist, recently called for a \u201cconservative\u201d approach to rate-setting, while Catherine Mann, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), argued that policy should stay \u201crestrictive for longer\u201d to contain inflationary pressures.\nIn Japan, Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race, paving the way for her likely appointment as Prime Minister, remains a key factor weighing on the Yen. Markets view her pro-stimulus and fiscally supportive stance as a signal that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may delay any further rate hikes. Expectations for monetary tightening at the October 29\u201330 policy meeting have now shifted to December, notes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, keeping the Japanese Yen under pressure.\nRecent Japanese economic data also argue against imminent monetary normalization. Nominal Cash Earnings rose only 1.5% YoY in August, far below the 4.1% forecast, while Real Wages fell 1.4%, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline. Weak wage growth continues to complicate the BoJ\u2019s tightening efforts, even as a depreciating JPY fuels imported inflation.\nOn Thursday, Etsuro Honda, economic adviser to the new LDP leader, said the BoJ should \u201cbe cautious about raising interest rates,\u201d adding that a weak JPY remains \u201cpositive for economic recovery.\u201d His remarks confirm expectations that Japan\u2019s next government will favor a continued accommodative stance, dampening prospects for near-term tightening.\nDespite Thursday\u2019s mild pullback, GBP/JPY remains close to its yearly highs of 205.33 and retains a broadly bullish bias, supported by the wide monetary policy gap between the BoE and the BoJ.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

The cryptocurrency broke through $100,000 to trade above $125,000, up 9% in early October.

IBIT's $426.2 million worth of net inflows yesterday was enough to tip it over the milestone, reaching approximately 802,198 BTC \u2014 3.8% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply.\nFor context, that puts BlackRock's holdings on behalf of its clients strongly ahead of the leading bitcoin treasury company, Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,031 BTC \u2014 worth around $78 billion \u2014 accounting for 3.1% of total supply.\nThe combined U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs attracted another $440.7 million on Wednesday, adding to an eight-day run totaling more than $5.7 billion, according to data compiled by The Block. IBIT's seven-day positive run has generated over $4.1 billion worth of net inflows alone.\n\"The eight-day streak of ETF inflows underscores persistent structural demand, while corporate treasury participation continues to expand, adding ballast to bitcoin's narrative as a strategic reserve asset,\" BRN Head of Research Timothy Misir told The Block. \"Meanwhile, easing geopolitical risk via the Trump-brokered Middle East peace framework has reduced short-term volatility, giving traders a clearer runway into Q4.\"\nHungry fish\n\"IBIT is #1 in weekly flows among all ETFs w/ $3.5 billion which is 10% of all net flows into ETFs,\" Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X ahead of Wednesday's flow data. \"Also notable is the rest of the 11 OG spot BTC ETFs all took in cash in the past week, even GBTC somehow, that's how hungry the fish are. Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.\"\nOn Monday, the bitcoin ETFs attracted their largest daily haul since pro-crypto Trump won the U.S. presidential election last November \u2014 bringing in $1.21 billion. The U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have now registered nearly $63 billion in inflows since their debut, with IBIT bringing in $65 billion and net outflows from Grayscale's converted fund offsetting the total.\n\"Spot BTC ETFs on an all-time heater\u2026 Have taken in absurd *$5.3 billion* over the past 7 trading days. $2 billion just over the past two days,\" NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci added. \"I remember when people thought the entire category would top out at $5 billion total assets.\"\nBlackRock's bitcoin ETF previously surpassed the 500,000 BTC mark last December, rapidly becoming the third-strongest U.S. ETF instrument in its first year.

Until now, U.S.-listed crypto ETFs have been limited to holding underlying assets passively, without the ability to participate in network consensus.\nThe amended filings, submitted this week, come after several months of quiet lobbying from ETF issuers seeking regulatory clarity around staking income. While the inclusion of this language does not mean the SEC has approved the feature, it indicates that the agency is at least considering the idea.\nAnalysts view this as an early sign that the SEC\u2019s stance on staking may be softening, especially given the growing pressure to allow ETFs to compete with on-chain yield opportunities available to retail and institutional investors abroad.\nWhat staking inside an ETF could mean for ETH and SOL yields\nFor Ethereum, current staking rewards range between 3% and 4%, while Solana\u2019s rewards typically fall between 7% and 8% annually. ETF management fees for these funds are generally around 0.20% to 0.30%, meaning that if staking proceeds are distributed to holders, the yield could cover or even exceed the fund\u2019s fees.\nSuch a change could transform how ETF issuers compete in the market. Instead of focusing solely on management costs and liquidity, future funds may also compete on net yield, creating a new performance metric for investors comparing crypto ETFs.\nWhile the SEC has not yet commented on these amendments, the filings suggest that staking could soon move from the on-chain economy into traditional financial products, bridging a gap between DeFi incentives and regulated investment vehicles."

Following a successful $400,000 seed round, the AI-driven DeFi project has already sold over 4.5 million tokens. It is entering the spotlight as investors seek exposure to early-stage tokens that combine advanced automation, real-world functionality, and multi-chain interoperability.\nThe Blazpay presale is structured into multiple phases, each with a fixed allocation and incremental price increase - up to 25% between rounds. This approach introduces transparency and scarcity, a model that historically rewards early participants while driving progressive market momentum.\nJust hours into its public launch, Blazpay has already recorded over 1 million tokens sold, signaling strong demand from investors eager to engage with the project\u2019s AI-enhanced decentralized ecosystem.\nPresale Overview - Structured Growth, Real Utility\n- Presale Phase 1 Price: $0.006\n- Tokens Sold: Over 1 million within the first 24 hours\n- Seed Round: $400,000 raised before public sale\n- Next Phase: Up to 25% price increase once Phase 1 allocation sells out\n- Current Status: Live - limited allocation remaining\nThis launch strategy, mirroring successful DeFi rollouts seen in previous market cycles, blends scarcity mechanics with genuine technical innovation - ensuring that Blazpay is more than just another speculative presale.\nThe Vision - Merging AI and DeFi Into a Unified Experience\nBlazpay\u2019s core mission is to simplify decentralized finance by making it more intelligent, accessible, and automated. The project introduces a platform where AI actively assists users in managing, trading, and optimizing their portfolios across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\nIn an era where DeFi remains fragmented - with separate interfaces for staking, trading, and asset management - Blazpay\u2019s ecosystem provides a unified, AI-powered interface designed to handle it all.\nMulti-Chain Connectivity - Eliminating Barriers Between Blockchains\nAt its foundation, Blazpay supports direct interaction across more than 20 blockchain networks, enabling users to seamlessly trade, stake, and move assets without the need for external bridges or risky cross-chain tools.\nThis multi-chain-native architecture delivers two key benefits:\n- Security: Reducing vulnerabilities associated with bridge exploits.\n- Seamless User Experience: Allowing users to move assets freely with minimal friction.\nBy offering cross-chain interoperability within a single interface, Blazpay positions itself at the center of a growing trend - the convergence of multi-chain liquidity and automated DeFi access.\nAs 2025 progresses, interoperability has become one of the market\u2019s leading narratives, and Blazpay\u2019s ability to unify these networks gives it a strong edge in both user adoption and developer integration potential.\nPerpetual Trading - CEX Performance Meets DeFi Freedom\nBlazpay extends its ecosystem beyond traditional DeFi features by offering perpetual decentralized trading, bringing professional-grade leverage tools directly to the blockchain.\nWith this feature, users gain access to:\n- Instant trade execution\n- On-chain risk controls\n- Transparent position management\nThis capability mirrors centralized exchange functionality but maintains non-custodial transparency, allowing users to trade freely without giving up control of their assets.\nAs more traders migrate toward decentralized platforms, Blazpay\u2019s integration of leverage and automation could make it a go-to platform for those seeking professional-level trading without centralized intermediaries.\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Rebound Fuels the AI-DeFi Narrative\nThe Ethereum (ETH) market has regained its bullish momentum, and that\u2019s vital context for Blazpay\u2019s emergence.\nAs of October 9, 2025, Ethereum trades between $4,675 and $4,695, rebounding strongly from support near $3,868.

                "body": "Ethereum developers unveiled Kohaku, a roadmap that aims to improve wallet privacy and security through a modular framework designed for developers and advanced users.\nThe project, announced in a Thursday blog post by Ethereum Foundation coordinator Nicolas Consigny, outlines plans to build a set of privacy and security primitives for the Ethereum ecosystem.\nAt its core, Kohaku aims to create a software development kit (SDK) for building secure wallet functions, and a reference wallet that demonstrates how these tools work in practice. The first version will come as a browser extension based on the Ambire wallet, designed for advanced users who want more control and privacy.\nKohaku is being developed in collaboration with well-known Ethereum ecosystem teams, including Ambire, Railgun, DeFi Wonderland, Helios and Oblivious Labs. The project is open source, and developers are encouraged to contribute through its GitHub repositories.\nRelated: Privacy is \u2018Constant Battle\u2019 Between Blockchain Stakeholders and State\nKohaku aims to cut wallets\u2019 dependence on centralized services\nKohaku\u2019s primary goal is to reduce the reliance of wallets on centralized services that can track transactions. The project will include features like private sending and receiving, hiding IP addresses, separate accounts for each DApp and P2P transaction broadcasting that bypasses normal remote procedure call (RPC) servers.\nIt also plans to add social recovery options using tools such as ZK Email or Anon Aadhaar, making it easier to restore access without giving up privacy. ZK Email uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable anonymous verification of emails, while Anon Aadhaar allows users to prove their identity in a privacy-preserving way.\nIn the long run, the team aims to bring wallet security even closer to the device level, which they refer to as \u201cas close as possible to the silicon.\u201d This means creating a native Ethereum browser where users can safely interact with DApps, IPFS content and decentralized networks without data leaks.\nRelated: EU\u2019s privacy-killing Chat Control bill delayed \u2014 but fight isn\u2019t over\nEthereum Foundation forms \u201cPrivacy Cluster\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new initiative called the Privacy Cluster, bringing together 47 leading researchers, engineers and cryptographers to develop privacy features at the protocol level of the Ethereum network.\nThe group will work alongside the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team to introduce tools such as private payments, confidential identity systems, and zero-knowledge infrastructure designed to protect user data directly on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 blockchain.\nThe Privacy Cluster includes multiple Ethereum Foundation and PSE initiatives, with Kohaku being one.

Final Outlook: Solana and Blazpay Define Opposite Ends of the Crypto Growth Curve\n- 6. Frequently Asked Questions\nThe presale crypto landscape in 2025 is heating up with a mix of established leaders and groundbreaking newcomers. While Solana (SOL) continues to solidify its position among the top-performing Layer-1 blockchains, Blazpay is quickly gaining traction as one of the most promising crypto presale projects with utility merging DeFi, NFTs, and AI-driven automation in one unified ecosystem.\nBoth projects are capturing investor attention for very different reasons. Solana\u2019s on-chain growth reflects institutional confidence, while Blazpay\u2019s seamless integration of DeFi utilities and blockchain-powered Entry Passes and Utility Keys points toward long-term adoption potential. Together, they define what smart investors are calling the top 1000x crypto coins 2025.\nSolana (SOL): Momentum Building Ahead of Q4 Breakout\nThe latest data as of October 2025 shows Solana (SOL) trading between $232 and $234, following a modest +2% monthly gain in September. Despite short-term volatility between $200 and $250, Solana\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, underscored by growing network activity and increasing institutional adoption.\n- Active Users: 1.8 million daily\n- Stablecoin Growth: +9.5% market cap increase, dominated by USDC\n- Institutional Investment: $2 billion in new asset treasuries launched on-chain\n- Key Resistance: $250-$260\n- Analyst Targets: $352-$424 for Q4 2025\nEven as monthly revenue dipped by 11%, Solana\u2019s ecosystem continues expanding into DeFi, gaming, and tokenized assets, signaling real-world adoption that supports its long-term price trajectory. The blockchain\u2019s high transaction throughput and low fees make it a prime candidate for scalability-focused institutions.\nTechnical indicators show higher-lows formation across major timeframes, a classic sign of bullish continuation. Analysts believe that once Solana breaks and sustains levels above $250, a rally toward $300-$350 becomes highly plausible.\nIn the current presale crypto narrative, Solana stands out as a Layer-1 cornerstone, a benchmark that new projects like Blazpay are building upon through innovation and user-focused design.\nBlazpay ($BLAZ): The Seamless Crypto Solution Setting New Standards in DeFi Utility\nWhile Solana commands attention on the open market, Blazpay is turning heads during its presale stage as a project that blends AI-powered finance, NFT utilities, and cross-chain innovation into a single platform. Positioned among the most advanced crypto presale projects with utility, Blazpay\u2019s ecosystem is designed to make decentralized finance effortless, transparent, and accessible to everyone.\nBlazpay\u2019s growth reflects genuine community trust, not hype. Its infrastructure supports AI-driven automation, multi-chain interoperability, and smart asset management, establishing it as one of the top 1000x crypto coins 2025.\nWhy Blazpay Stands Out as the Best Crypto Presale\nOne of Blazpay\u2019s biggest strengths lies in its real, functional utilities, a feature that distinguishes it from typical presale hype projects. It is designed to bring real value to users and developers, not just offer tokenized access. The platform integrates a suite of utilities that streamline digital experiences, trading, and platform interactions.\nKey utilities include:\n- Gamified Rewards \u2013 Incentivize participation across ecosystems, turning engagement into tangible benefits.\n- Multichain Access \u2013 Seamlessly operate across multiple blockchain networks without friction.\n- SDK Integrations \u2013 Developers can easily build, integrate, and deploy apps on Blazpay\u2019s unified ecosystem.\n- Perpetual Trading \u2013 Access adv"

The financing, priced at $6.50 per unit with stapled warrants exercisable at $9.75, was designed to build what the company called the world\u2019s largest Solana treasury.\nAs part of that plan, Sharps also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Solana Foundation to acquire $50 million worth of SOL at a 15% discount to its 30-day average price.\nThe agreement, according to the company, reflects a shared goal of expanding Solana\u2019s role as a global financial infrastructure layer capable of handling institutional-scale settlement and liquidity.\nIn October, Sharps followed up with a $100 million stock repurchase program, authorizing the buyback of common shares through both open market and privately negotiated transactions.\nThe company said the repurchase plan would allow it to manage shareholder value while maintaining a strong balance sheet alongside its blockchain treasury holdings. The decision to entrust its Solana reserves to Coinbase shows Sharps\u2019 focus on regulatory compliance and asset protection.\nCoinbase Prime, which caters to institutional investors, provides insured custody and integrated trading services for corporate clients, a key consideration for firms managing large crypto treasuries.\nHelius Expands Solana Holdings as Institutional Treasuries Cross $4B\nHelius, a Solana-focused Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) firm, is weighing plans to acquire up to 5% of Solana\u2019s total supply, a stake worth more than $6 billion at current prices.\nThe company, formerly known as Helius Medical Technologies, has already built one of the largest Solana treasuries to date.\nAs of October 6, it held more than 2.2 million SOL tokens worth roughly $525 million, alongside $15 million in cash reserves.\nThe holdings were accumulated shortly after closing a $500 million private placement in September led by Pantera Capital, with an additional $750 million in stapled warrants that could expand total treasury capital to $1.25 billion.\nData from the Strategic Solana Reserve shows institutional holdings exceeding $4 billion across 18 participants, representing about 3.1% of the token\u2019s circulating supply.\nForward Industries leads with 6.8 million SOL valued at $1.69 billion, followed by Sharps Technology with 2.1 million SOL and DeFi Development Corp with just over 2 million SOL.\nForward Industries recently closed a $1.65 billion private placement backed by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital.

By working with Coinbase, the company can securely manage and grow its crypto holdings while tapping into the expertise of one of the most trusted names in digital assets.\n\u201cBy utilizing Coinbase\u2019s suite of products, STSS can enjoy the institutional-grade infrastructure, deep liquidity, and competitive pricing required to effectively manage a leading Solana treasury,\u201d said James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS.\nThe company plans to use Coinbase Prime\u2019s secure custody services and OTC trading desk as part of this partnership. This highlights its commitment to supporting the global growth of digital assets while working with trusted, regulated crypto service providers.\nSharps Technology\u2019s Treasury Pivot\nSharps Technology, a medical device sales and distribution company, has shifted to a digital asset strategy by building a treasury of Solana SOLUSDT tokens. The company uses capital raised from the markets to generate on-chain yields within the Solana ecosystem.\nSharps Technology first revealed its shift to a Solana treasury strategy in August, through a $400 million private placement with the goal of creating one of the largest Solana digital asset treasuries.\nAlice Zhang, the company\u2019s new Chief Investment Officer, noted that Solana\u2019s growing institutional adoption makes it the ideal time to launch a SOL treasury. With a team experienced in scaling institutional crypto platforms and strong ties to the Solana ecosystem, Zhang believes the company is well-positioned for success.\nPart of A Broader Trend\nThis is part of a growing trend where firms are shifting to crypto strategies, as a way to strengthen their balance sheets and deliver more value to shareholders.\nDeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) and Superteam Japan recently launched DFDV JP, Japan\u2019s first Solana-based digital asset treasury. While Solana treasury company Helius Medical Technologies (now Solana Company), plans to acquire at least 5% of SOL supply.\nThese strategies highlight how traditional companies are increasingly embracing blockchain and digital assets.

Still, recent price action suggests Wall Street\u2019s rally could continue as dips have been consistently bought. Earlier, the S&P 500 futures touched new record highs before easing slightly, so we it wouldn\u2019t be entirely shocking now if the Dow Jones and other US indices were to bounce back, given the proximity of record levels from current levels on major US indices. Investors will weigh whether the market can keep rising into earnings season, so profit-taking around key levels should not come as surprise in the coming days. So far, traders have largely ignored talks of a tech bubble. Instead, the focus remains on whether the sector\u2019s heavyweights can deliver results strong enough to justify their lofty valuations. Hopes of two additional Fed rate cuts in 2025 are also keeping spirits high, helping offset worries about a softer labour market. For now, the Dow Jones forecast remains bullish.\nDow Jones forecast: Technical analysis and trade ideas\nFrom a technical point of view, the Dow Jones forecast remains bullish. That\u2019s because the index has been forming higher highs and higher lows. Every major and minor dips have been bought. The fact that we have been hitting new highs and then pulling back only mildly suggests the bulls remain largely in control of price action. Thus, the weakness we have observed so far this week could be another such scenario.\nIndeed, the Dow Jones chart was consolidating inside what looked like a short-term bull flag pattern. The index was testing a prior resistance area near 46,400 at the time of writing. With the other major indices breaking to new highs today, I would be expecting the DJIA to potentially bounce back from around here. If it does, then the focus will turn to the resistance trend of the bull flag pattern. And if it can break out of that pattern then this will signal a continuation of the trend, in which case a new all-time high above the most recent peak of 47,057 could be on the cards.\nHowever, if support breaks here around 46,400 decisively, then that could potentially see the index drift lower in the coming days towards 46,000 with 45,700 being the next key support to watch. The long-term support is further low around the 45K area, where the index had topped out back in January, before we finally broke above it in August, after a couple of unsuccessful attempts earlier in the summer.\nUpcoming earnings could provide direction\nThe next meaningful cue for markets will probably come from the new earnings season. Reports begin this week with companies like PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines, before attention shifts to major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. These stocks could well have an impact on the Dow Jones forecast. But as for the wider markets, it\u2019s the tech giants due later in the month that will really shape the course of US stock markets. Investors will want confirmation that the AI-driven optimism powering this year\u2019s rally is grounded in genuine performance. Strong results could justify the market\u2019s exuberance; weak ones might expose how dependent recent gains have been on sentiment alone.\nThe bullish trend still rules\nFor now, the message is simple: the trend remains in charge. Markets have shrugged off negative headlines since spring, and unless earnings or macro data deliver a real surprise, that resilience looks set to continue. The Dow Jones forecast therefore stays bullish \u2013 perhaps not euphorically so, but solid enough to keep traders leaning long. Those already positioned are likely to hold, while newcomers may prefer to wait for a clearer dip before joining the trend.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R"

Yesterday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted record closing highs, while the Dow ended down by just one point.\nGold futures, which have soared 50% this year and crossed the $4,000 threshold for the first time this week amid a flight to safety, pulled back 2% to $3,990.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield\u2014which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans\u2014ticked higher to 4.14%. Bitcoin fell 2% to about $121,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, advanced 0.5% to 99.44. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures was down 1.7% to $61.50 per barrel.\nThursday was the ninth day of the U.S. government shutdown, and there are no obvious signs the funding stalemate will end soon, with President Donald Trump saying during a Cabinet meeting today that the White House plans to eliminate programs popular with Democrats.\nIn corporate news, shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 4.3% after the carrier reported record third-quarter revenue and issued a rosy outlook for Q4, while PepsiCo (PEP) stock rose 4.2% to lead after the soda and snacks giant's Q3 results topped estimates and it replaced its CFO as Elliott Investment Management presses for change.\nElsewhere, Nvidia (NVDA) shares advanced 1.8% to hit an all-time high on a report the White House and Saudi Arabia are nearing a deal to allow U.S. chipmakers to export semiconductors to the Gulf nation.\nAlso, Akero Therapeutics (AKRO) shares popped 16% after Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced it was buying the firm working on a liver disease treatment for up to $5.2 billion; Ferrari (RACE) shares sank 15% after the Italian luxury carmaker issued a soft outlook; and Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped 0.7% after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the electric vehicle maker's Full Self-Driving software.\nIn addition, Costco Wholesale (COST) stock rose 3.1% after it reported strong monthly sales figures, while Boeing (BA) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow, with shares down 4.1% after Turkish Airlines' chair said the carrier might switch a recent order for 150 737 MAX planes to Airbus if engine talks fail.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nDecliners\n- Dell Technologies (DELL) stock dropped 5.2% to lead losses on the S&P 500, giving back a portion of the 9% gain posted in the prior session after Dell raised its forecasts for annual revenue and profit growth. The company said its broad portfolio of tech products makes it well-positioned to benefit from demand for artificial intelligence.\n- Shares of homebuilders lost ground after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, echoed criticism from President Trump accusing major residential construction firms of artificially inflating home prices. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM), the homebuilder founded by Pulte's grandfather, fell close to 5%, while shares of D.R. Horton (DHI) and other industry players also declined.\n- The record-setting rally for gold prices lost some of its luster Thursday, with futures prices falling below the $4,000-per-ounce milestone that the precious metal surpassed this week for the first time. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 3.6%.\nAdvancers\n- Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, jumped 5.2%. Other mineral and rare earths stocks also surged after China announced additional restrictions on certain raw materials ahead of a meeting set for later this month between the country's leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. TD Cowen analysts also boosted their price target on Albemarle stock, pointing to pricing improvements in the lithium market.\n- Delta A"

                "url": "https://ts2.tech/en/london-stock-exchange-at-record-highs-inside-the-historic-markets-brexit-battle-and-2025-revival/",
                "body": "- Historic Exchange: The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is one of the world\u2019s oldest and Europe\u2019s largest stock exchanges, tracing its roots back to 1698 and formally founded in 1801 [1] [2]. It has evolved over centuries, from coffee-house trading to today\u2019s electronic markets.\n- Structure: The LSE\u2019s Main Market is home to around 1,400 companies across 40+ sectors and is divided into Premium and Standard listing segments [3] [4]. It also runs the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for smaller growth companies with lighter listing requirements [5].\n- Key Indices: The FTSE 100 (\u201cFootsie\u201d) comprises the 100 largest blue-chip stocks on the LSE and is the best-known UK market index [6]. The FTSE 250 covers the next 250 mid-sized companies, often more UK-focused. Together they form the FTSE 350 and, along with smaller listings, the FTSE All-Share index.\n- Trading Hours: The LSE operates Monday\u2013Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM London time (GMT/BST), one of the longest continuous trading days globally [7]. (It even has a brief 2-minute midday pause at 12:00 for auction pricing [8], but no extended lunch break.)\n- Global Financial Hub: London has long been a global financial center, and the LSE is highly international \u2013 it lists companies from over 60 countries and provides deep pools of capital and liquidity [9]. It has historically rivaled New York in market size and attracted foreign firms seeking international investors.\n- Brexit Impact: Five years on from Brexit, the LSE\u2019s ecosystem has felt the strain. U.K. equity funds saw persistent outflows and underperformance relative to the U.S., as overseas investors found the U.K. market \u201coverly complicated and politically uncertain\u201d post-Brexit [10]. Some trading in EU stocks shifted to continental exchanges, and Amsterdam emerged as a rival listing venue for big IPOs [11].\n- Resilience & Record Highs: Despite challenges, the FTSE 100 index has shown remarkable resilience. It hit new record highs in Q3 2025, continuing into October [12]. On October 8, 2025, the FTSE 100 closed at an all-time peak of 9,548.87 points [13], buoyed by surging bank stocks and gold miners amid record gold prices [14]. The FTSE 100 was up ~14% year-on-year by early October [15], far outperforming the more domestically oriented FTSE 250 mid-cap index (which nonetheless offers a hefty ~3.5% dividend yield) [16].\n- IPO Drought and Delistings: London has faced a listing drought \u2013 only 18 IPOs occurred in all of 2024, the fewest since 2010 [17], and 2025 started even slower with just 3 main-market IPOs in the first nine months [18]. Meanwhile, over 150 companies since early 2024 have either delisted or moved their primary listing abroad (often to New York) [19]. High-profile departures like Flutter Entertainment, TUI, Wise, and Ashtead cited lower valuations and liquidity in London as key factors [20].\n- Recent Revival Signs: A late-2025 flurry of listings is sparking hope. In October, Beauty Tech Group floated on the LSE at a \u00a3300 million valuation (shares jumped 5% on debut) and tinned-food maker Princes announced listing plans [21]. \u201cThese listings will really help\u2026 in the last few months, we\u2019ve definitely seen an acceleration of companies seriously considering IPOs,\u201d says Julian Morse, co-CEO of investment bank Cavendish [22]. Advisers are optimistic this could mark a turning point if newcomers trade well [23].\n- Major Market Movements: 2025 has seen big sector rotations. Banking stocks rallied strongly on the back of rising interest rates and regulatory relief \u2013 e.g. Lloyds Banking Group jumped 3.7% in one day after regulators eased a misconduct fine [24]. Commodity stocks boomed as gold topped $4,000/oz and miners like Fresnillo surged [25]. In contrast, property and real estate have lagged: on Oct 8, student-housing firm Unite Group plunged 10% after reporting slower rental growth [26]. Even small-cap resource companies saw speculative spikes \u2013 for instance, Canada\u2019s Leading Edge Materials, dual-listed in London"

                "url": "https://ts2.tech/en/ftse-100s-record-run-inside-londons-blue-chip-rally-and-whats-next/",
                "body": "- Fresh Highs: The FTSE 100 index surged to an all-time closing high of around 9,548 points in early October 2025, capping a record-breaking streak [1] [2]. It\u2019s up roughly 15\u201317% year-to-date, putting 2025 on track to be the FTSE\u2019s strongest year since 2009 [3].\n- What\u2019s Driving the Rally: Recent gains have been led by heavyweight banking, mining, and healthcare stocks. Banks jumped on upbeat earnings and regulatory relief \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group leapt 2.6% in one day after regulators proposed a milder-than-feared mis-selling penalty [4]. Precious metal miners like Fresnillo and Endeavour Mining also outperformed as gold prices smashed past $4,000/oz for the first time, boosting safe-haven demand [5].\n- Global Boost & Weak Pound: The record high comes amid a global stock rally. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit new peaks in the U.S., while Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 likewise notched fresh records alongside the FTSE [6] [7]. A softening pound has supercharged the FTSE 100\u2019s international firms \u2013 about 75% of FTSE company earnings come from abroad, so a weaker sterling inflates those profits in GBP [8]. Strength in dollar-earning giants like Shell and BP has accounted for a large share of the index\u2019s gains [9].\n- Market Sentiment: Investor mood is broadly optimistic, buoyed by hopes that central banks will ease policy. Traders are betting on an imminent U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut following soft economic data, a shift that fueled the FTSE\u2019s best weekly jump since April [10] [11]. However, caution lingers \u2013 the Bank of Englandrecently warned that \u201cstretched\u201d valuations in the AI tech sector make global markets vulnerable to a sudden correction [12], and Citi analysts just downgraded UK equities to underweight, arguing the FTSE\u2019s defensive-heavy makeup could lag if investors pivot to growth stocks [13].\n- Key News Highlights: Political and economic developments are in focus. Britain\u2019s new government under PM Keir Starmer is preparing a November budget that may include tax changes, keeping some domestic firms on edge [14]. Overseas, a surprise French government resignation in early October rattled European markets and briefly hit bank stocks amid broader fiscal jitters [15] [16]. On the positive side, the UK has inked a major trade deal with India, with Starmer pushing for its rapid implementation during an October visit to New Delhi [17]. Geopolitical events are also moving markets \u2013 for instance, Middle East tensions have driven oil and gold prices higher, though a tentative Gaza peace deal announced on Oct 9 offered some relief (and coincided with a modest FTSE pullback).\nWhat Is the FTSE 100 Index?\nThe FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100) is the flagship stock index of the London Stock Exchange, tracking the 100 largest companies by market capitalization listed in the UK. Often called the \u201cFootsie,\u201d it serves as a barometer of British large-cap equities. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning each company\u2019s influence on the index is proportional to its market value (adjusted for free-float shares) [18]. In practical terms, bigger companies like Shell or HSBC move the FTSE 100 far more than smaller constituents. The FTSE 100 is maintained by FTSE Russell (part of London Stock Exchange Group) and is updated in real time during trading hours. It\u2019s also a basis for countless investment products \u2013 from index funds and ETFs to futures contracts \u2013 giving investors a way to track or trade the overall London market easily.\nImportantly, the FTSE 100 is not a direct mirror of the UK economy \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of global companies that just happen to be listed in London [19]. Many have minimal revenue from the UK itself. For example, Antofagasta (a Chilean copper miner) and Pershing Square Holdings (a U.S. hedge fund) are in the FTSE 100 despite having few domestic operations [20]. Even titans like Shell, the index\u2019s largest company, derive less than 5% of profits from the UK [21]. In effect, the FTSE 100 reflects the fortune"

                "body": "59% of Americans disapprove of RFK Jr.'s moves as health secretary, a new poll says\nMost Americans disapprove of RFK Jr.\u2019s moves as health secretary, a new poll says\nWhat people believe about health increasingly depends on how they feel about politics, according to a new poll.\nConsider President Trump's Sept. 22 warning about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. KFF, the nonpartisan health policy research organization, polled voters about Trump's statements the day after he made them.\n\"What we see is that it's hugely divided among partisans,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, the associate director of polling for KFF. The poll found 59% of Democrats believed President Trump's statements about Tylenol were \"definitely false.\" On the other hand, an almost equal percentage of Republicans \u2014 56% \u2014 believed the claim to be either \"definitely true\" or \"probably true.\"\nThere is no scientific research showing a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. But during an unusual press conference last month, Trump told pregnant women to \"tough it out\" and avoid taking the popular pain reliever. Physicians groups, meanwhile, continue to reiterate that it is the safest medicine to take in pregnancy, when untreated fever or pain can cause other problems.\nThe poll, which also asked voters about other topics, offers a window into how dramatically public opinion has changed, along with federal health policies.\nThe poll found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seen a precipitous decline in public trust \u2014 most recently among Democrats, as the Trump administration works to dismantle many of its mandates. Kirzinger notes a 24% decline in trust in the CDC's vaccine information among Democrats, just in the past two years.\n\"The problem is the mistrust is caused by these very people who are ostensibly leading us,\" former Surgeon General Richard Carmona tells NPR. Carmona, who served under President George W. Bush, is one of six former surgeons general who recently penned an op-ed in The Washington Post warning that Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. represents a \"threat\" to the nation's health. \"They've dismantled the agencies that had real scientists who provided information, and instead replaced it with ideology,\" Carmona says. \"We're already seeing diseases that we usually don't see coming back, like measles. People will die, and the ramifications are significant.\"\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, writes in a statement to NPR, \"The polling released by KFF identifies a lack of trust in public heath institutions which predates Secretary Kennedy's tenure. The secretary remains committed to rebuilding public trust in HHS and its entities through transparency and gold standard science.\"\nKirzinger says polls historically have consistently found that people trust their doctors the most when it comes to getting advice about their own health. But increasingly \u2014 and especially after the appointment of Kennedy as Trump's health secretary \u2014 she says party lines are more critical in determining what sources of information people rely on as the basis for their health decisions. \"Among Republicans, RFK is as trusted ... as their own health care provider,\" Kirzinger says the data shows.\nAnd yet overall, Kennedy's job approval rating ranks low; the poll also found 59% of people \u2014 mainly Democrats and independents \u2014 disapproved.\nKirzinger says that as faith in federal health agencies declines, people are turning to very different sources.\nDemocrats say they're relying on professional medical groups, like the American Medical Association. \"More than 8 in 10 Democrats say that they trust the AMA or the American Academy of Pediatrics, but among Republicans, it's only about half,\" Kirzinger says.\nWhat this means is the landscape of public health is very fragmented, and people are making choices based on very disparate beliefs. \"As people are going to different sources of information to make decisions around their"

                "body": "At a Cabinet meeting Thursday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. repeated a claim linking the use of Tylenol in infants to autism. Kennedy also said children circumcised shortly after birth have twice the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol for pain relief following the procedure.\nHis assertion appears to reference a 2015 study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine that examined ritual circumcision and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in Danish boys under 10. The study found a higher rate of autism among circumcised boys but did not establish a cause.\nResearchers in that study suggested pain from the procedure might play a role but noted they had no data on what painkillers were used, making it impossible to assess any connection to Tylenol. Other scientists have since emphasized that the Danish research showed only a correlation, not causation, and that broader studies have found no credible evidence linking Tylenol or circumcision to autism.\nDoes Tylenol Cause Autism? What to Know\nAs the most common over-the-counter pain and fever medication worldwide, more than half of pregnant women use acetaminophen to manage everything from fever to back pain.\nDuring a White House briefing last month, standing alongside Kennedy, Trump suggested that acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, may be linked to higher autism rates in the United States, a connection experts have studied but say remains unproven.\n\u201cTaking Tylenol is not good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll say it. It\u2019s not good.\u201d\nThe remarks about autism by the Republican president and members of his administration have reverberated across the United States, sparking a range of reactions from autistic people and their families. Some have welcomed the renewed attention and promises of additional research funding for the complex developmental condition. Others have expressed anger, saying the comments promote stigma, assign blame, and spread claims not supported by scientific evidence.\nAdditional research could lead to a better painkiller for pregnant women, but acetaminophen is still \"best option\" for some patients, according to Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist and co-author of research linking the active ingredient in Tylenol to increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\"There are going to be times when acetaminophen is the best option,\" Bauer told Newsweek. \"I think what we're trying to express is \u2014 at this point \u2014 women should try to seek other non-pharmaceutical methods to deal with nuisance-type pain, discomfort. But for anything severe or for fever, they should probably have a consultation with their doctor.\"\nExpecting mothers should then decide the best path forward with their physicians, Bauer said.\nIs It Safe to Take Tylenol While Pregnant?\nThe president went on to say last month that women should avoid acetaminophen \"during the entire pregnancy,\" claiming, without providing evidence, that it is \"very dangerous to the woman's health.\"\nTrump said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would begin notifying doctors that the use of acetaminophen \"can be associated\" with an increased risk of autism, but the president did not provide any medical evidence for the new recommendation. He also urged parents not to give the drug to newborns.\nDr. Noa Sterling, an OB-GYN, said Trump\u2019s comments, particularly about Tylenol, touched a nerve for many parents of young autistic children.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this kind of narrative that you have to be careful of absolutely everything you do in pregnancy, and if you eat the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, you\u2019re going to irreparably harm your baby,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cSo the Tylenol just plays directly into this fear that, \u2018I\u2019ve taken something that has caused this condition in my child.\u2019\u201d\nBauer said her research published last month in the journal Environmental Health found a \"strong and consistent association\" between prenatal use of Tylenol and offspring diagnosed with autism, attention-deficit/hypera"

It jumped to a high of \u00a548,465, up by over 57% from the lowest level this year.\nForeign investors are buying Japan stocks\nThe Nikkei Index and other Japanese indices, like the Topix have been in a strong uptrend this year. One reason for this is that foreign investors have continued buying these shares.\nData released on Thursday showed that these investors bought shares worth over \u00a52.46 trillion, which is equivalent to $16.3 billion. These purchases happened after the victory of Sanae Takaichi, who has favored Abenomics-like policies.\nMost notably, inflows into Japanese stocks happened after three weeks of intensive selling as investors anticipated that a more hawkish official would win the seat.\nThe ongoing Nikkei 225 Index jump is being led by companies in the defense and technology industries. Some of the most notable gainers are companies like Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan Steel Works, and IHI Corp. Technology companies like those in the semiconductor industry have also had substantial inflows.\nForeign investors have been buying Japanese stocks in the past few year after Warren Buffett moved into the market. He invested in five trading houses \u2013 Mitsui, Itochu, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Marubeni \u2013 during the pandemic and then added to their position.\nJapanese yen crash continues\nThe Nikkei 225 Index has also jumped as investors reacted to the relatively weak Japanese yen. Data shows that the USD/JPY exchange rate has soared from a low of 139.95 in May this year to the current 152.50, its highest point since February.\nThe Japanese yen has slumped partly because of the ongoing US dollar rebound. It also plunged as investors reacted to Takaichi\u2019s victory, which they believe will lead to more stimulus and an easy-money policy.\nThe yen slump coincided with the soaring Japanese bond yields. Data shows that the 30-year rose to 3.30%, while the ten-year jumped to 1.70%.\nLooking ahead, the next major catalyst for the Nikkei 225 Index will be the earnings season. Fast Retailing and Seven & I Holdings have already published their earnings.\nLater this month, companies like Hitachi, Chugai Pharma, Fujitsu, Canon, and Tokyo Gas will publish their financial results.\nNikkei 225 Index technical analysis\nThe daily timeline chart shows that the Nikkei Index has been in a strong bull run in the past few months. It has jumped from a low of \u00a530,690 on April 7 to the current \u00a548,403.\nThe index has jumped above the important resistance level at \u00a540,227, the highest point in October and November last year. It was also the highest level in January.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued rising.\nThe RSI has formed a broadening wedge pattern. Therefore, the index will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at \u00a550,000.\nThe post Nikkei 225 Index forecast as foreigners buy, Japanese yen crashes appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nFTSE 100 Index hits ATH as Rolls-Royce, Lloyds, Fresnillo shares soar\nNikkei 225 Index forecast as foreigners buy, Japanese yen crashes\nThe Nikkei 225 Index continued its strong rally this week as foreign investors continued buying and the Japanese yen plunged to its lowest level in weeks.

                "body": "The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has embarked on a landmark shift in its monetary policy, officially commencing the sale of its vast exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings as of September 2025. This move marks a significant departure from over a decade of aggressive asset purchases aimed at stimulating the Japanese economy and combating deflation. While new ETF purchases ceased in March 2024, the central bank's decision to begin unloading its substantial portfolio signals a new phase for Japanese financial markets, with immediate implications for equity valuations and investor sentiment.\nThe gradual divestment plan, announced on September 19, 2025, has already sent ripples through the market, prompting a temporary dip in the Nikkei 225 and a strengthening of the Japanese yen. This strategic unwinding of one of the world's most unconventional monetary easing programs will be closely watched by global investors, as it redefines the landscape for public companies and asset managers operating within Japan.\nUnpacking the BOJ's Pivot: Specifics, Timeline, and Market Response\nThe Bank of Japan's journey into equity markets began in December 2010, with a substantial expansion of its ETF purchase program in 2013 under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" initiative. The primary objective was clear: to combat persistent deflation, lower equity risk premia, and provide robust support to stock prices, making the BOJ a pioneering central bank in using equity ETFs as a monetary easing tool. Over the years, the BOJ accumulated an immense portfolio, reaching a book value of \u00a537.1 trillion (approximately $250 billion USD) as of September 2025.\nThe pivotal moment arrived in March 2024, when the BOJ officially ended new purchases of ETFs, signaling a shift away from its ultra-loose monetary policy. This was followed by the crucial announcement on September 19, 2025, that the central bank's policy board had unanimously decided to commence the sale of its existing ETF and Japan Real Estate Investment Trust (J-REIT) holdings. The divestment strategy is designed to be deliberately slow-paced, with plans to sell ETFs at approximately \u00a5330 billion per year (on a book value basis) and J-REITs at about \u00a55 billion per year. At this rate, liquidating the entire ETF portfolio could take over a century, underscoring the BOJ's commitment to minimizing market disruption. This decision followed the successful disposal of stocks purchased from financial institutions in July 2025.\nInitial market reactions to the September 2025 announcement were notable. The Nikkei 225 stock index experienced a drop of over 1%, and the Japanese yen strengthened, reflecting some surprise among market participants regarding both the decision and its timing. Key players involved in this transition include BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and the BOJ's policy board, who have consistently emphasized the importance of market stability and flexibility in their disposal strategy. The central bank acknowledges the \"BOJ premium\" that its purchases previously instilled in stock prices and is treading carefully to avoid a sharp reversal.\nWinners and Losers: Corporate Fortunes in a Post-BOJ Purchase Era\nThe Bank of Japan's shift from an aggressive buyer to a gradual seller of ETFs will inevitably create a new set of dynamics for public companies trading on Japanese exchanges. For over a decade, the BOJ's purchases acted as a significant underlying support for the stock market, benefiting a wide array of companies, particularly those included in major indices like the Nikkei 225 (TYO: N225) and TOPIX (TYO: TPX). The removal of this steady buying pressure means companies will now rely more heavily on fundamental performance, investor demand, and corporate governance for their valuations.\nCompanies with strong fundamentals, robust earnings growth, and attractive dividend policies are likely to emerge as relative winners. These firms, often large-cap exporters or technology innovators, may find increased in"
