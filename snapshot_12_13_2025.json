                "body": "The financial markets are currently witnessing an intriguing and somewhat counter-intuitive phenomenon: a significant surge in both gold prices and U.S. Treasuries. This dual rally, particularly the simultaneous rise of gold and falling Treasury yields (indicating rising bond prices), signals a profound shift in investor sentiment, driven by a complex tapestry of economic anxieties, evolving monetary policies, and persistent geopolitical instability. As of December 12, 2025, spot gold has traded above $4,271 per ounce, after reaching a record $4,398 in mid-October, while U.S. Treasury prices have climbed, pushing the 10-year yield to around 4.14% after the Federal Reserve's recent rate cuts.\nThis flight to safety underscores a pervasive sense of caution among investors, who are increasingly seeking havens for capital preservation amidst a volatile stock market and concerns over global economic stability. The unusual tandem movement of these typically inversely correlated assets suggests a market grappling with underlying inflationary pressures, potential recessionary risks, and a reassessment of traditional growth assets. The immediate implication is a heightened focus on risk management and diversification, as market participants brace for potential turbulence ahead.\nUnpacking the Dual Rally: Details, Drivers, and Market Reactions\nThe remarkable ascent of both gold and U.S. Treasuries in 2025 has been a defining characteristic of the financial year, reflecting a market in flux. Gold, a perennial safe-haven asset, has seen an extraordinary rally, achieving over 50 all-time highs and returning over 60% in 2025 alone. This surge culminated in a record high of $4,398 per ounce in mid-October 2025, with prices remaining robust above $4,271 by December. This performance has been mirrored by silver, which also saw a blistering rally to record highs above $61 and even $64 an ounce. Concurrently, U.S. Treasury prices have risen, translating to falling yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield settling around 4.14% as of December 5, 2025, and the US Treasury Index showing a 6.67% year-to-date return as of November 30, 2025.\nSeveral key factors have converged to fuel this dual rally. Geopolitical tensions, including regional conflicts and ongoing US-China tariff concerns, have created a significant risk premium, driving investors towards gold as a hedge against global instability. Simultaneously, concerns over global monetary instability and persistent inflationary pressures have prompted central banks and institutional investors to diversify into hard assets. The weakening U.S. dollar, partly a consequence of the Federal Reserve's dovish stance, has further boosted gold's appeal by making it more affordable for international buyers. The Federal Reserve's (US: FED) actions have been a pivotal player, implementing multiple interest rate cuts in 2025, totaling 75 basis points across three meetings, including a 25 bps cut in December. This low-rate environment significantly enhances the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like gold and makes existing higher-coupon bonds more appealing, thus pushing Treasury prices up.\nThe timeline of events leading up to this moment highlights a gradual but accelerating shift in market dynamics. Throughout 2025, a softening trend in the labor market, with elevated unemployment forecasts and significant jumps in jobless claims, prompted the Fed to adopt a more accommodative stance. This dovish pivot, coupled with the Fed's decision to end quantitative tightening and initiate \"Reserve Management Purchases\" (RMPs) of Treasury bills (approximately $40 billion starting December 12, 2025) to alleviate stress in short-term funding markets, has been interpreted as a \"QE-lite\" measure. This expansion of the money supply tends to weaken fiat currencies and bolsters confidence in hard assets. Global central banks, particularly those in emerging markets like China and India, have also been significant stakeholders, su"

                "body": "Inflation Alert! Money Supply Increasing at Fastest Rate Since 2022\nAs the Federal Reserve revs up the money-creating machine even higher, the money supply is already growing at the fastest rate since July 2022, in the early stages of the tightening cycle.\nAfter peaking in April 2022, the money supply began to decline as the Fed hiked rates that year. The money supply bottomed in October 2023 and began increasing again. The money supply is now well above the pandemic peak.\nAnd money creation has accelerated over the last several months.\nBased on the \u201ctrue,\u201d or Rothbard-Salerno, money supply measure (TMS), the money supply grew at 4.76 percent year-on-year. That was up from the September increase of 4.06 percent. Money supply growth was also up significantly compared to October of last year, when year-over-year growth was 1.27 percent.\nAugust, September, and October all posted some of the largest month-on-month growth rates we\u2019ve seen since 2022, rising 1.18 percent, 1.4 percent, and 1.14 percent, respectively.\nEconomists Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno developed the TMS metric to provide a more accurate measure of money supply fluctuations.\nMoney supply growth as measured by the Fed\u2019s M2 metric is surging even faster. Year-over-year, it grew by 4.63 percent in October, up from 4.47 percent in September.\nM2 is now at the highest level it\u2019s ever been, at nearly $22.3 trillion. TMS hasn't returned to its 2022 peak but is running at a 34-month high.\nLooking at the bigger picture, the central bank has expanded the money supply at an exponential rate since the 2008 financial crisis.\nBased on the TMS metric, the money supply has grown by over 200 percent since 2009. Looking at it another way, more than 2/3 of the current money supply has been created since the financial crisis.\nThat\u2019s a lot of money creation \u2013 i.e., inflation \u2013 in a short period of time!\nThe Money Printer Is Humming Again\nThe fact that money supply growth has ramped up since the Fed began cutting interest rates underscores an important point. The central bank doesn\u2019t have to create money through quantitative easing to increase the money supply. Artificially low rates are inflationary in a fractional reserve banking system.\nAnd at the December meeting, the Federal Reserve announced a pivot back to money printing with a return to QE operations beginning this week.\nAccording to Fed officials, the central bank will purchase $40 million in Treasury Bills on Friday (Bills are short-term Treasuries that mature in one year or less). From that point, purchases will \u201cremain elevated for a few months\u201d before they are \u201csignificantly reduced.\u201d\nOf course, you will not hear any central banker or mainstream pundit utter the words \"quantitative easing.\"\nIn fact, if pushed, they\u2019ll almost certainly deny that they\u2019re doing it. They\u2019ll call it \u201creserve management,\u201d or tell you they\u2019re engaged in \u201ctechnical operations\u201d to keep the financial system\u2019s plumbing moving.\nHowever, an expansion of reserves is an expansion of reserves, whether you call it quantitative easing or not.\nIn practice, the Fed plans to start buying Treasury bills with money created out of thin air. This will increase the money supply and put downward pressure on Treasury rates. The balance sheet will grow; liquidity will increase; risk asset bubbles will get more air. This is exactly what QE does. So, call it what you want. The effect is the same as QE.\nIt creates inflation.\nFed chairman Jerome Powell claims that monetary policy is close to neutral, but it is clearly loose. In fact, based on the Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index, monetary policy has been historically loose throughout the tightening cycle in 2022/2023.\nThis Is Inflation\nWhile inflation watchers focus almost exclusively on price measures such as the CPI, an expanding money supply drives price inflation. In fact, inflation used to be defined as an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion "

Last month\u2019s report projected a deficit of 50,000 bpd and the September report a shortfall of 700,000 bpd.\nOil extended an earlier decline after the report was published and was down over 3% to about $63 a barrel.\nLOWER DEMAND FOR OPEC+ CRUDE\nOPEC lowered its 2026 demand forecast for OPEC+ crude by 100,000 bpd from the previous projection after an upward revision to its 2025 estimates for production outside OPEC+.\nOPEC\u2019s demand forecasts are at the higher end of industry estimates, such as those from the International Energy Agency. OPEC\u2019s outlook for a supply deficit in 2026 stood in contrast to that of the IEA and many analysts.\nThere is still a large gap between OPEC\u2019s projections and those of other forecasters, which expect supply to outpace demand significantly next year.\nIEA EXPECTS A GLUT\nThe IEA\u2019s latest forecasts imply that supply could exceed demand by about 4 million bpd in 2026, equal to almost 4% of global demand. The agency, which advises industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts on Thursday.\nOPEC also said the global economy\u2019s growth trend remained firm and it maintained its forecasts for global oil demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd this year and at a slightly faster rate in 2026.\n\"The global economy has remained resilient through 2025, supported by easing trade uncertainty since the summer,\" OPEC said in the report.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

The ICE Brent front-month contract dropped in November by 29\u00a2/b, m-o-m, to average $63.66/b, and the NYMEX WTI front-month contract dropped by 59\u00a2/b, m-o-m, to average $59.48/b. The GME Oman front-month contract dropped by 41\u00a2/b, m-o-m, in November, to average $64.53/b. The Brent\u2013 WTI front-month spread averaged $4.18/b in November, up by 30\u00a2/b, m-o-m. The backwardation structures of ICE Brent and GME Oman futures contracts were little changed, m-o-m, in November. This indicates that, despite speculative activity in the futures market, near-term physical crude market fundamentals remained supportive, amid relatively low OECD stock levels. The forward curve of NYMEX WTI flattened, m-o-m, with the nearest time spread narrowing. Hedge funds and other money managers maintained a broadly bearish stance in November, reinforcing downward pressure on the oil futures complex.\nWorld Economy\nThe global economy is forecast to continue its steady expansion, supported by solid performance seen so far this year. The global economic growth forecast for 2025 is revised up slightly to 3.1%, while for 2026 it remains unchanged at 3.1%. The US economic growth forecasts remain at 1.8% for 2025 and 2.1% for 2026. Japan\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 1.1% for 2025 and 0.9% for 2026. Eurozone economic growth forecasts remain unchanged at 1.2% for both 2025 and 2026. China\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 4.8% for 2025 and 4.5% for 2026. India\u2019s prospects have improved, with economic growth forecasts revised up to 6.7% for 2025 and 6.6% for 2026. Brazil\u2019s economic growth forecast remains at 2.3% for 2025, while 2026 is lowered slightly to 2.0%. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are revised down slightly to 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.\nWorld Oil Demand\nThe global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 remains at 1.3 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. In the OECD, oil demand is forecast to grow by about 0.1 mb/d in 2025, while the non-OECD is forecast to grow by about 1.2 mb/d. In 2026, global oil demand is forecast to grow by about 1.4 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. The OECD is forecast to grow by about 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y, while the non-OECD is forecast to grow by about 1.2 mb/d, y-o-y.\nWorld Oil Supply\nNon-DoC liquids production (i.e., liquids production from countries not participating in the Declaration of Cooperation) is forecast to grow by about 1.0 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2025, revised up slightly from last month\u2019s assessment. The revision is only about 50 tb/d, mainly to accommodate for seasonality and data received so far for 4Q25. The main growth drivers for 2025 are expected to be the US, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina. The non-DoC liquids production growth forecast for 2026 remains at 0.6 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment, with Brazil, Canada, the US, and Argentina as the main growth drivers. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) and non-conventional liquids from countries participating in the DoC are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2025, to average 8.6 mb/d, followed by a similar increase of about 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2026, to average about 8.8 mb/d. Crude oil production by countries participating in the DoC increased by 43 tb/d in November, m-o-m, to average about 43.06 mb/d, according to available secondary sources.\nProduct Markets and Refining Operations\nIn November, refining margins rose across all regions, adding to the gains registered in the previous month.

Those barrels at sea are referred as \u2018dark barrels.\u2019 This means they are not officially counted as oil production. Dark barrels may be as high as 1.4 billion barrels, that\u2019s a lot of oil on the water so to speak. This is sharply higher than 2024 when the number ran between 1.1 and 1.2 billion.\n15% of the world\u2019s oil supply are now under sanctions. Putin is promising India uninterrupted oil shipments. His \u2018shadow\u2019 fleet of tankers has been able to eventually deliver to Russia and China in the past. China has been adding about 290,000 barrels a day to storage. This dampens the \u2018extra\u2019 supply of oil literally floating around the world.\nAs they are in China, the oil reserves do not officially count. Were that oil in Cushing, OK, the situation would look like 2020 when the market literally ran out of storage. The oil price went negative as there was not enough space to accommodate all the supply. But since the oil is in China the price has remained steady around $60 for WTIC, higher for Brent.\nThe International Energy Agency is located in Paris, France. Did you really think they would choose, say Libya?\nOPEC output has slowed due to problems in Kuwait and Kazakhstan. Official supply has dropped 1.5 million barrels a day. OPEC is based in Vienna, not Kuwait, no surprise there! OPEC is set to add another 137,000 barrels a day in December.\nMeanwhile in the Caribbean, Venezuela\u2019s export income is 90% based on oil. The U.S. seized one of the tankers Wednesday carrying $80M of oil. That is about 5% of what the country spends on imported goods. So even one seizure has real meaning for Maduro\u2019s regime. It seems a safe bet that Trump has not deployed 20% of the entire U.S. Navy to seize one or two or three tankers. Dissident Machado is in Oslo, Norway, accepting the Noble Peace Prize for her opposition to Maduro. In disguise, she passed ten military checkpoints, boarded a boat and finally a private aircraft to get there. Time is running out for Maduro.\nOur forecasts for the stock market have been incorrect.

Despite the FED cut of a quarter point, which merely now matches the three-month T-bill, ten-year rates are up a full 1.18% today. Higher long-term rates lie ahead."

Last month\u2019s report projected a deficit of 50,000 bpd and the September report a shortfall of 700,000 bpd.\nOil extended an earlier decline after the report was published and was down over 3% to about $63 a barrel.\nLOWER DEMAND FOR OPEC+ CRUDE\nOPEC lowered its 2026 demand forecast for OPEC+ crude by 100,000 bpd from the previous projection after an upward revision to its 2025 estimates for production outside OPEC+.\nOPEC\u2019s demand forecasts are at the higher end of industry estimates, such as those from the International Energy Agency. OPEC\u2019s outlook for a supply deficit in 2026 stood in contrast to that of the IEA and many analysts.\nThere is still a large gap between OPEC\u2019s projections and those of other forecasters, which expect supply to outpace demand significantly next year.\nIEA EXPECTS A GLUT\nThe IEA\u2019s latest forecasts imply that supply could exceed demand by about 4 million bpd in 2026, equal to almost 4% of global demand. The agency, which advises industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts on Thursday.\nOPEC also said the global economy\u2019s growth trend remained firm and it maintained its forecasts for global oil demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd this year and at a slightly faster rate in 2026.\n\"The global economy has remained resilient through 2025, supported by easing trade uncertainty since the summer,\" OPEC said in the report.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

The ICE Brent front-month contract dropped in November by 29\u00a2/b, m-o-m, to average $63.66/b, and the NYMEX WTI front-month contract dropped by 59\u00a2/b, m-o-m, to average $59.48/b. The GME Oman front-month contract dropped by 41\u00a2/b, m-o-m, in November, to average $64.53/b. The Brent\u2013 WTI front-month spread averaged $4.18/b in November, up by 30\u00a2/b, m-o-m. The backwardation structures of ICE Brent and GME Oman futures contracts were little changed, m-o-m, in November. This indicates that, despite speculative activity in the futures market, near-term physical crude market fundamentals remained supportive, amid relatively low OECD stock levels. The forward curve of NYMEX WTI flattened, m-o-m, with the nearest time spread narrowing. Hedge funds and other money managers maintained a broadly bearish stance in November, reinforcing downward pressure on the oil futures complex.\nWorld Economy\nThe global economy is forecast to continue its steady expansion, supported by solid performance seen so far this year. The global economic growth forecast for 2025 is revised up slightly to 3.1%, while for 2026 it remains unchanged at 3.1%. The US economic growth forecasts remain at 1.8% for 2025 and 2.1% for 2026. Japan\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 1.1% for 2025 and 0.9% for 2026. Eurozone economic growth forecasts remain unchanged at 1.2% for both 2025 and 2026. China\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 4.8% for 2025 and 4.5% for 2026. India\u2019s prospects have improved, with economic growth forecasts revised up to 6.7% for 2025 and 6.6% for 2026. Brazil\u2019s economic growth forecast remains at 2.3% for 2025, while 2026 is lowered slightly to 2.0%. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are revised down slightly to 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.\nWorld Oil Demand\nThe global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 remains at 1.3 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. In the OECD, oil demand is forecast to grow by about 0.1 mb/d in 2025, while the non-OECD is forecast to grow by about 1.2 mb/d. In 2026, global oil demand is forecast to grow by about 1.4 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. The OECD is forecast to grow by about 0.2 mb/d, y-o-y, while the non-OECD is forecast to grow by about 1.2 mb/d, y-o-y.\nWorld Oil Supply\nNon-DoC liquids production (i.e., liquids production from countries not participating in the Declaration of Cooperation) is forecast to grow by about 1.0 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2025, revised up slightly from last month\u2019s assessment. The revision is only about 50 tb/d, mainly to accommodate for seasonality and data received so far for 4Q25. The main growth drivers for 2025 are expected to be the US, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina. The non-DoC liquids production growth forecast for 2026 remains at 0.6 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment, with Brazil, Canada, the US, and Argentina as the main growth drivers. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) and non-conventional liquids from countries participating in the DoC are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2025, to average 8.6 mb/d, followed by a similar increase of about 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2026, to average about 8.8 mb/d. Crude oil production by countries participating in the DoC increased by 43 tb/d in November, m-o-m, to average about 43.06 mb/d, according to available secondary sources.\nProduct Markets and Refining Operations\nIn November, refining margins rose across all regions, adding to the gains registered in the previous month.

                "body": "The EUR/USD exchange rate remained stable at about 1.1741, following a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Fed officials suggested a pause in further easing, indicating a period of assessment due to delayed US economic data.\nCleveland Fed\u2019s Beth Hammack focused on inflation concerns, supporting the Fed\u2019s inflation target of 2%. Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee preferred waiting for more data before making decisions, hinting a preference to delay rate cuts until 2026. Kansas City Fed\u2019s Jeffrey Schmid pointed to little economic change since October, influencing his dissent against the rate cut.\nImpact Of Inflation And Economic Indicators\nAnna Paulson from the Philadelphia Fed discussed tariffs\u2019 limited effect on prices, stressing job risks over inflation. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices fell 0.5% month-on-month in November, aligning with projections, while Spain\u2019s index rose to 3.2% year-on-year.\nTechnical analysis of EUR/USD indicates a neutral to positive outlook, with potential gains if it surpasses 1.1762. Resistance levels are at 1.1800 and 1.1850, with the yearly peak at 1.1918. Support exists below 1.1700, with the 100-day Simple Moving Average at 1.1641.\nGiven the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cut but hawkish pause, we see a period of uncertainty for the EUR/USD. The split opinions among Fed officials, with some still highly concerned about inflation, suggest the central bank is not committed to a clear path. This means the market will likely be sensitive to every piece of incoming data, which has been delayed.\nThis wait-and-see approach is supported by the latest economic figures we saw before the data delays. The most recent US jobs report showed a solid addition of 199,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held firm at 3.7%. Meanwhile, the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed headline inflation moderating to 3.1%, justifying the Fed\u2019s decision to pause and assess.\nEuropean Economic Outlook And Trading Strategy\nOn the European side, the picture is also mixed, which supports a range-bound currency pair for now. While Spain\u2019s inflation ticked up slightly, the broader Eurozone inflation rate we saw in November cooled to 2.4%. This gives the European Central Bank little reason to act decisively, removing a major catalyst for a strong euro trend.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests a cautiously bullish but range-bound strategy in the coming weeks. One could consider using call spreads, such as buying a 1.1750 call and selling a 1.1850 call, to profit from a potential grind higher toward the year\u2019s peak. This strategy limits risk if the pair fails to break the key 1.1762 resistance level and reverses.\nHowever, the reliance on delayed data creates a risk of sharp moves once it\u2019s released. Market volatility, which we\u2019ve seen hovering near multi-year lows around the 13 level on the VIX, makes buying options relatively cheap. Purchasing a straddle or strangle with a one-month expiry could be a prudent way to position for a large price swing in either direction.\nAlternatively, if we believe the pair will remain contained between its major support and resistance levels, selling volatility could be attractive. An iron condor with short strikes outside the 1.1600 and 1.1850 levels would profit from low volatility and time decay. This play banks on the central banks remaining on hold through the end of the year."

Notably, however, USD/JPY retained bullish structure with ahold at the 155.00 level, setting the stage for next week\u2019s Bank of Japan rate decision. But before we get to that we\u2019ll get some US data to work with in the form of NFP and CPI reports.\nUS Dollar Breakdown on FOMC\nUS Dollar bears had an open door to push fresh lows this week and at this point, the 98.98 level that became a sticking point in 2025 trade has been taken-out again. While the Fed wasn\u2019t as dovish as rates markets were expecting, the context surrounding the meeting was surprising on a couple of fronts. First was the announcement of Treasury Bill purchases, which while not the QE that many claimed it to be, it was a far earlier announcement than what was being expected. But perhaps more surprising was Jerome Powell\u2019s claim during the press conference that he thought the US was losing about 20,000 jobs per month, which gave a quick shot of weakness to the USD that sent the currency spiraling lower.\nOn that front, we\u2019ll finally get some data in the week ahead with the delayed release of a Non-farm Payrolls report and that will be followed by a release of CPI data. And then the Bank of Japan is highly expected to lift rates towards the end of the week at their final rate decision of the year; but as has become customary, the bigger question is whether they lay the groundwork for another hike and that will be the likely driver behind price action.\nIn the USD, I remain of the mind that trends will be determined by whether EUR/USD can continue to rallyhttps://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/eur-usd-remains-the-key-for-fx-market-trends/. That\u2019s been a stumbling block in the second half of the year but given the deviation discussed in the Tuesday webinar, with Isabel Schnabel saying that she was comfortable with markets expecting the ECB\u2019s next move to be a hike, there\u2019s possible disparity in rate policy between the two economies and that can justify a bullish lean on the fundamental side of the pair.\nIn the USD, the resistance looked at in the Tuesday webinar held as DXY built a bear flag formation. That was broken at the rate decision on Wednesday and sellers continued to push, erasing a large portion of the prior Q4 gain. Going into next week, the 98.98 level can now be re-purposed as resistance potential, and for more aggressive approaches, there\u2019s a prior swing level at 98.60 that caught a quick bounce that\u2019s also of interest.\nUS Dollar Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Bigger-Picture\nGoing into next week that Q4 open price is a big level as there\u2019s a couple of different items of interest in similar vicinity.\nThere\u2019s some remaining unfilled gap from early-October, spanning from 97.71-97.96. But there\u2019s also a projected target from a double top formation nearby at 97.46. If bears can push, this would be a significant area to test and this could be looked to as the next major area of support for bearish continuation scenarios. Again, the likely key around this theme will be driven back to the Euro which I\u2019ll look at below.\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nAs we wind into the weekly close I have EUR/USD still testing at a major level of 1.1748.

I talked about that Fibonacci retracement at-length in the larger article on the topic of Fibonacci and I used this as an example.\nUltimately it was the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements that stymied bulls following a massive rally in the first-half of the year.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nCh"

It\u2019s been a steady climb, and one that says more about the other side of the pair than anything happening at home.\nCable\u2019s latest leg higher has come almost entirely on the back of renewed weakness in the Greenback, especially after the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered an interest rate cut on Wednesday.\nLooking ahead, the British Pound is likely to stay in the spotlight. A busy domestic calendar is lined up, with key UK data releases and the Bank of England (BoE) policy meeting on December 18 set to shape near-term direction.\nIn the rates space, UK money markets have been far less decisive. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields chopped around during the week and ended barely changed, offering little in the way of fresh signals for FX traders.\nUS Dollar weakness does the heavy lifting\nSince bottoming out near the psychologically important 1.3000 area in November, Cable has closed lower in just one week. That period neatly coincides with the start of a more pronounced correction in the US Dollar (USD).\nThe USD sell-off reflects a growing belief among investors that the Fed is shifting onto a more dovish footing in the months ahead. Adding to the uncertainty is the looming end of Jerome Powell\u2019s term as Chair in May, with speculation around his successor now firmly part of the market conversation.\nDecember cut firmly back on the table\nThe \u2018Old Lady\u2019 kept interest rates unchanged at its early November meeting, but the message was unmistakably dovish. A surprisingly tight vote, along with hints that Governor Andrew Bailey could soon align with the more accommodative camp, kept the prospect of a December rate cut alive.\nDespite UK headline inflation still sitting at uncomfortable levels, the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 5\u20134 to hold the bank rate at 4.0% for a second consecutive meeting. While the hold itself was widely anticipated, the narrow margin caught many off guard.\nThat split matters. It suggests the BoE is less confident than it might appear and increasingly comfortable with the idea that the next move is down, potentially as soon as December.\nThe dovish undertone was reinforced by a subtle tweak to the BoE\u2019s forward guidance. Policymakers dropped the word \u201ccareful\u201d and instead said that if disinflation continues, rates are likely to follow a gradual downward path. It may sound like a minor linguistic shift, but markets are unlikely to overlook it.\nFurther evidence came from the BoE\u2019s Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey. Firms now expect to raise prices by 3.7% over the next year, slightly higher than the previous reading, while inflation expectations held steady at 3.4%.\nWith headline CPI easing to 3.6% in October, a level the BoE believes marked the peak, the argument for cutting rates from 4.0% is gaining traction, even as wage growth expectations ticked up modestly to 3.8%.\nPolicymakers edging closer to easing\nThe BoE appears headed for another knife-edge 5\u20134 decision at its December meeting, but this time the balance may tilt towards a rate cut. The swing vote is once again expected to be Governor Andrew Bailey, who backed a hold in November.\nSince that meeting, BoE commentary has largely followed established voting lines. The more hawkish voices, Clara Lombardelli, Catherine Mann, Megan Greene, and Huw Pill, continue to flag upside risks to inflation, persistent wage pressures, and uncertainty over how restrictive policy really is. Their stance suggests another vote to keep rates unchanged.\nOn the other side, the doves remain comfortable with the idea of gradual policy easing. Bailey has kept a low profile sin"

Going into next week, the 98.98 level can now be re-purposed as resistance potential, and for more aggressive approaches, there\u2019s a prior swing level at 98.60 that caught a quick bounce that\u2019s also of interest.\nUS Dollar Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Bigger-Picture\nGoing into next week that Q4 open price is a big level as there\u2019s a couple of different items of interest in similar vicinity.\nThere\u2019s some remaining unfilled gap from early-October, spanning from 97.71-97.96. But there\u2019s also a projected target from a double top formation nearby at 97.46. If bears can push, this would be a significant area to test and this could be looked to as the next major area of support for bearish continuation scenarios. Again, the likely key around this theme will be driven back to the Euro which I\u2019ll look at below.\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nAs we wind into the weekly close I have EUR/USD still testing at a major level of 1.1748. This is a price that\u2019s been on the radar for much of the year as it\u2019s the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2021-2022 major move; and it was the 23.6% retracement of that same setup that caught the lows in January and February of this year. I talked about that Fibonacci retracement at-length in the larger article on the topic of Fibonacci and I used this as an example.\nUltimately it was the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements that stymied bulls following a massive rally in the first-half of the year.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Shorter-T"

                "body": "The Pound Sterling is under pressure after the release of the UK\u2019s GDP data for October, which showed a contraction of 0.1%. This data missed the expected growth of 0.1%, affecting GBP/USD performance.\nDespite reaching a technical resistance at the 1.3400 mark, GBP/USD remains in a bullish phase as the week concludes. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate cut has bolstered market risk appetite, subsequently impacting the US Dollar.\nImpact of the Fed\u2019s Rate Cut on the Market\nThe Pound rallied during the North American session, climbing over 0.68% following the Fed\u2019s rate cut and a disappointing jobs report, both of which hurt the USD. GBP/USD reached a six-week high at 1.3417 at the time of reporting.\nIn related news, market discussions include President Trump\u2019s considerations for Federal Reserve replacements and shifts in silver and gold prices. The Dow Jones experienced a retreat from record highs, though it remains on track for a weekly gain. The financial insights offered are intended to assist traders in making informed decisions.\nWe are seeing a clear conflict in the market right now. The Pound is being held up near a six-week high of 1.3417 mainly because the US Fed is cutting rates, which weakens the dollar. However, the UK economy itself is showing signs of trouble with GDP shrinking for a second month.\nImplications of UK Economic Weakness\nThis situation feels familiar, as it reminds us of the technical recession the UK entered back in the second half of 2023 when the economy also contracted for two straight quarters. That history suggests this new weakness shouldn\u2019t be ignored, creating significant downside risk for the Pound if US dollar weakness subsides. This puts the technical resistance around the 1.3400 level under a major spotlight.\nThe Bank of England is caught in a difficult position, much like it was in early 2024 when inflation was still sticky around 4% even as growth faltered. This indecision means we are unlikely to get a clear policy path, which usually leads to choppy, unpredictable price action. For derivative traders, this uncertainty between a weak UK economy and a dovish US Fed is the main takeaway.\nThis is a classic setup for buying volatility through options strategies like straddles or strangles. Betting on a clear direction is risky, but betting on a big price move in the coming weeks seems more prudent as these conflicting pressures build. The market is coiled, and a breakout is likely as new data comes in.\nWe should be watching upcoming US releases like Nonfarm Payrolls and CPI very closely. These figures will determine the Fed\u2019s next move and could easily overpower the negative UK data, causing a sharp rally, or disappoint and cause the pair to finally break lower. Either outcome would reward traders positioned for a spike in volatility."

December seasonality typically leans AUD/USD-positive \u2014 or USD-negative \u2014 especially in the second half of the month, so a push toward the September high remains on the table.\nBut with momentum already fading and the year\u2019s strongest data now behind us, bulls may want to stay nimble if AUD/USD makes a run at 0.67.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nAUD/USD Nears Key Resistance as Weekly Momentum Stretches\nThe daily chart shows prices flat on the day, with traders taking the softer jobs data in stride. Even so, the rally has stalled around a weekly VPOC at 0.6670 and the monthly R2 pivot near 0.6680.\nIf we see a pullback I suspect it will be minor, and dip buyers would see retracement down to the October high as a gift. But once the current pause for breath is done and dusted, a move to 67c seems quite likely, with a break of the September high bringing the October 2024 VPOC into focus.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge"

The pair\u2019s on a roll for a third week in a row, as traders keep unwinding their long Dollar positions. And it\u2019s all happening while the overall market tone remains heavily influenced by the expectation that the Federal Reserve will soften its policy.\nWhile the Fed said only one more cut in 2026 was on the cards, markets aren\u2019t actually convinced. Investors are now starting to think it might get two rate cuts next year, thanks to Jerome Powell highlighting risks in the labor market and stressing the need to keep the jobs machine ticking over. That\u2019s had a steady drag on the Dollar, allowing higher-risk currencies like the Aussie to take centre stage.\nRBA Outlook Adds Even More Strength to the Aussie\nThe Aussie is also getting a boost from the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s hawkish stance. Although the RBA left rates unchanged this week, Governor Michele Bullock made it clear that the Board has been discussing rate hikes and sees little room for rate cuts.\nThat kind of tone helped offset the mixed domestic job figures, reinforcing investor confidence that Australia is still looking at a tighter monetary policy than the Fed is.\nMarket Tone & Data in Focus\nThere aren\u2019t any major US economic releases on Friday, so it\u2019s all about how the broader market is feeling. With equities and the Dollar pretty stable, traders are still being drawn to the Aussie. Next week, we get a few key US macro updates, so we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on them.\nKey drivers to watch out for:\n- How Fed interest rate expectations are shifting\n- What the RBA has to say about inflation resilience\n- How the global market is feeling and the flow of money into/ out of equities\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nAUD/USD is currently trading at 0.6663 and just chugging along within an ascending channel that\u2019s been in place since late November. Price action is showing higher highs and higher lows along the channels\u2019 midline. That all points to a steady stream of buying, even if the momentum is starting to fade. We have 0.6677 to get through first before the next resistance zone comes into play (that\u2019s near 0.6702), and if we break above that, we could see 0.6724 on the cards.\n- Check out our free forex signals\n- Follow the top economic events on FX Leaders economic calendar\n- Trade better, discover more Forex Trading Strategies\n- Open a FREE Trading Account"

By contrast, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut, lowering the Federal Funds Rate to the 3.50%-3.75% range, its third cut this year, reinforcing expectations that US monetary policy has entered a gradual easing phase.\nMarkets are now increasingly pricing in a prolonged pause from the RBA, with expectations building that the next policy move could be a rate hike in 2026 if inflation remains sticky. On the US side, traders continue to expect two rate cuts next year, despite limited forward guidance from the Fed.\nThis policy divergence continues to underpin the Aussie, keeping AUD/USD on track for a third consecutive weekly gain.\nEarlier in the day, Comments from Fed officials showed continued caution around the policy outlook. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid both dissented against this week\u2019s rate cut. Goolsbee said he preferred to wait for greater clarity, particularly on inflation, before easing further, noting that recent data point to stable economic growth and only a moderate cooling in the labour market.\nSchmid said that not much had changed since the previous meeting and added that monetary policy remains only modestly, if at all, restrictive, noting that the economy is showing momentum and that inflation remains too high.\nWith the key policy events now out of the way, market attention is shifting toward next week\u2019s incoming economic data. Traders will closely watch the preliminary S&P Global PMIs from both Australia and the United States on Tuesday for fresh signals on economic momentum.\nIn the US, the spotlight will be on the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) reports for October and November, alongside Retail Sales on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Thursday.\nEconomic Indicator\nNonfarm Payrolls\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls release presents the number of new jobs created in the US during the previous month in all non-agricultural businesses; it is released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile. The number is also subject to strong reviews, which can also trigger volatility in the Forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish, although previous months' reviews and the Unemployment Rate are as relevant as the headline figure. The market's reaction, therefore, depends on how the market assesses all the data contained in the BLS report as a whole.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Dec 16, 2025 13:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 119K\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nAmerica\u2019s monthly jobs report is considered the most important economic indicator for forex traders.

U.S. payrolls remain the headline act, with Fed speakers and a Supreme Court case adding intrigue around the policy outlook. In Japan, the BoJ is widely expected to hike, but Governor Ueda\u2019s press conference looms as a bigger risk event. With technical signals neutral, price action deserves greater attention.\nFront-End U.S. Yields Driving USD/JPY Moves\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY has seen a strengthening relationship with movements at the front of the U.S. interest rate curve over the past fortnight, logging correlation coefficients with market pricing for Fed rate cuts in 2026 and two-year yields of -0.7 and 0.77 respectively. That\u2019s far stronger than for longer-dated U.S. yields, yield spreads between the U.S. and Japan, or risk-linked instruments such as S&P 500 or VIX futures over the same period. This suggests the U.S. interest rate outlook has become an increasingly dominant influence on its recent performance, placing greater emphasis on upcoming risk events that could meaningfully impact Fed pricing.\nPayrolls Take Centre Stage Amid Fed\u2019s Employment Focus\nSource: TradingView (U.S. Eastern Time)\nWhen it comes to volatility events that could do just that, few come bigger than U.S. nonfarm payrolls, especially at a time when the Fed\u2019s reaction function is heavily skewed towards achieving its full employment mandate rather than price stability. Yes, the October report is dated due to the prior U.S. government shutdown and arrives unusually on a Tuesday rather than Friday, but make no mistake: markets will still react as they would on any other occasion, particularly given the Fed\u2019s eagerness to ease policy on even a hint of weakness.\nAn increase of 40,000 is expected, with the unemployment rate forecast to hold at 4.4%. While the Fed is judged on the unemployment rate, it\u2019s clear a majority of FOMC members are concerned that slower jobs growth risks lifting unemployment, so expect the payrolls figure to be a dominant driver of USD/JPY in the immediate aftermath of the release. Weakness risks sparking a sharp downside flush in USD/JPY, while a strong outcome is likely to result in upside.\nWith less focus on the inflation mandate, readings on average hourly earnings and underemployment may garner less attention than usual. Aside from the payrolls report, flash PMI releases from S&P Global and jobless claims data are the other releases to watch, especially the latter with seasonal volatility around Thanksgiving likely to subside, providing a real-time indication of what\u2019s happening in the labour market.\nFed Speakers and Legal Risks Add Intrigue\nSource: TradingView (U.S. Eastern Time)\nOn the central bank front, several FOMC members will be in action with speeches from New York Fed President John Williams and Governor Christopher Waller the ones to watch. They were the two FOMC members who sparked the dovish shift in rate cut pricing prior to the December FOMC, so the fact they\u2019re talking on payrolls day is no coincidence.\nSource: TradingView\nWhile it\u2019s not on the economic calendar, Monday\u2019s Supreme Court hearing on Trump\u2019s attempt to remove FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter also matters for the Fed. It\u2019s a test of presidential power over independent agencies and may provide a preview of arguments on Trump\u2019s bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, due to begin on January 21. Any sign the court could weaken job protections may raise fears about Fed independence, likely weighing on the U.S. dollar and longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields.\nUeda\u2019s Tone Could Dictate Price Action\nIn Japan, the key risk event arrives late in the week with the Bank of Japan interest rate decision on Friday.

The pair attracts bids as the Japanese Yen (JPY) underperforms across the board, despite traders remaining confident that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will raise interest rates in its monetary policy meeting next week.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the weakest against the Canadian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nThe major reason behind firm BoJ hawkish bets is expectations that inflation in Japan is on tract to return sustainably to the 2% target.\nLast week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will continue raising interest rates, however, there is \u201cuncertainty on how far we can eventually raise them\u201d.\nThe pair recovers even as the US Dollar (USD) is under pressure since the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) monetary policy announcement on Wednesday. In the policy meeting, the Fed reduced interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% and signaled that there will be one more in 2026. Contrary to Fed\u2019s outlook, investors anticipated before the policy outcome that the Fed will signal no further interest rate cuts.\nGoing forward, investors will focus on the United States (US) Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for November, which will be released on Tuesday. On the same day, investors will also focus on the Retail Sales data for November and preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data for December.\nInvestors will closely monitor the employment data to get cues about the current status of labour demand.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions.

At the same time, a strong risk-on tone across global markets has reduced demand for traditional safe-haven assets, leaving the Yen struggling to find support.\nEven so, the growing likelihood of BoJ tightening keeps Yen buyers active on dips. The US Dollar is also not showing much strength. It remains close to a two-month low after the Federal Reserve delivered a dovish outlook on Wednesday. This combination makes traders cautious about chasing USD/JPY higher after the pair rebounded from levels below 155.00.\nAsian equities moved higher on Friday, following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally, which further weighed on safe-haven positioning. Concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s reflation-driven agenda have also kept the Yen from gaining traction. Meanwhile, recent Japanese data continues to support the argument for policy normalization. The Corporate Goods Price Index showed inflation staying above historical levels, reinforcing Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s recent comments that the central bank\u2019s economic and inflation projections are increasingly achievable.\nWith the key BoJ meeting beginning December 18, traders are hesitant to place heavy bearish bets on the Yen. On the US side, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points and projected only one additional cut in 2026, although markets still expect more easing. Chair Jerome Powell highlighted risks to the labour market, adding to Dollar weakness and keeping USD/JPY capped.\nInvestors will look to upcoming FOMC speeches for clarity, but next week\u2019s BoJ decision remains the main driver for the pair.\nTrade Idea:\nConsider selling rallies below 156.00, aiming for a move toward 154.40. A protective stop above 156.40 helps manage risk."

Policymakers acknowledged that risks to both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate remain in play and reiterated that upcoming decisions will be guided by incoming data.\nWhile the guidance avoided committing to a clear easing path, markets viewed the outcome as less hawkish than many had anticipated.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who dissented against this week\u2019s rate cut, said on Friday that he favoured waiting for more clarity, particularly on inflation, before easing further.\nGoolsbee noted that while he remains optimistic that interest rates can come down meaningfully over the next year, he is wary of front-loading cuts given the inflation experience of recent years. He added that most incoming data points to stable economic growth, with the labour market showing only moderate signs of cooling.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoC Consumer Price Index Core (YoY)\nThe BoC Consumer Price Index Core, released by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on a monthly basis, represents changes in prices for Canadian consumers by comparing the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services. It is considered a measure of underlying inflation as it excludes eight of the most-volatile components: fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation and tobacco products. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to the same month a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Canadian Dollar (CAD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Mon Dec 15, 2025 13:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 2.9%\nSource: Statistics Canada\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/the-canadian-dollar-strengthens-against-the-us-dollar-amid-ongoing-reactions-to-recent-central-bank-policies/",
                "body": "The Canadian Dollar holds a firm position against the US Dollar as the markets process recent policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. Currently, USD/CAD trades near 1.3760, hitting a low not seen since mid-September and marking a third consecutive weekly decline due to general US Dollar weakness.\nThe Bank of Canada maintained its policy rate at 2.25%, which aligns with expectations. This decision suggests interest rates might remain stable until at least 2026, despite analysts hinting at eventual increases possibly starting in the fourth quarter of 2026, earlier than the previous estimate of early 2027.\nPotential Economic Indicators\nA fall in unemployment or persistent inflation might prompt quicker action. However, any worsening in labour-market conditions or USMCA-related trade uncertainties could delay rate hikes past 2026.\nConversely, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, setting the Federal Funds Rate target at 3.50%-3.75%. Though the Fed refrained from outlining a definite path for easing, the rate cut was less aggressive than expected.\nKey data influencing future monetary policy is the BoC Consumer Price Index Core, a vital measure of inflation expected on December 15, 2025. High readings typically strengthen the Canadian Dollar, while low readings weaken it.\nThe path forward is being shaped by the growing difference between the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. We have seen the Fed begin cutting rates this week, while the BoC is holding firm at 2.25% and signaling it may stay there well into 2026. This policy divergence is the main reason USD/CAD has been falling, and we expect this trend to continue.\nFuture Currency Expectations\nWe should anticipate continued strength in the Canadian dollar, especially with upcoming inflation data. The next Canadian CPI report is on Monday, December 15, and if core inflation remains near the previous 2.9% level, it will reinforce the BoC\u2019s decision to hold rates steady. Recent jobs data from November also showed the Canadian unemployment rate dipping to 5.7%, giving the bank little reason to consider easing policy.\nOn the other hand, the US dollar is likely to face headwinds. The Fed\u2019s rate cut to a 3.50-3.75% range signals a clear easing cycle, even if some policymakers are cautious. November\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which showed a moderate gain of around 160,000 jobs, supports the Fed\u2019s view that the economy is cooling enough to justify lower rates without risking a recession.\nThis sets up a key opportunity around next week\u2019s Canadian inflation data. Given the high impact of this release, we expect a short-term spike in volatility for USD/CAD. Traders could look at buying at-the-money puts and calls to position for a sharp move in either direction immediately following the announcement.\nFor a longer-term directional view over the next few weeks, the path of least resistance for USD/CAD appears to be lower. We should consider strategies that benefit from a declining pair, such as buying put options on USD/CAD with expirations in late January or February 2026. This allows us to express a bearish view while managing risk.\nWe need to remember how stubborn inflation was back in 2023 and 2024, which explains the BoC\u2019s current patience. Even though US interest rates are technically higher, the market is focused on the direction of travel. The spread between US and Canadian rates is expected to narrow as the Fed cuts further, which should keep applying downward pressure on the USD/CAD pair."

Sterling\u2019s strength persists even as weak UK GDP data reveals a 0.1% month-on-month contraction in October.\nThe British Pound continues to perform well against the Japanese Yen, with GBP/JPY near 208.64, a level not seen since August 2008. This marks a potential fifth consecutive weekly gain for the currency pair.\nAnticipated Market Decisions\nThe market anticipates decisions from both the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, expected next week. It is estimated that there is a 90% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut by the BoE, bringing the rate to 3.75%.\nIn Japan, despite expectations, the Yen\u2019s response remains limited due to uncertainty about the BoJ\u2019s policy direction. Reports indicate that the BoJ might view next week\u2019s meeting as the start of a broader tightening cycle, with speculation of rates potentially rising above 0.75%.\nA recent Reuters poll suggests that 90% of economists expect a rate increase to 0.75% during the December 19 meeting. Moreover, two-thirds anticipate rates could climb to at least 1.00% by next year.\nAs of today, December 12, 2025, we see the GBP/JPY currency pair trading near its highest level since 2008, holding strong around 208.64. This strength comes despite a weak UK economy, but the real focus for the coming weeks will be the central bank meetings. The market is pricing in a major policy clash between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ).\nContrasting Monetary Policies\nThe BoE is widely expected to cut its interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% on December 18. This expectation is solidified by recent data showing UK inflation for November 2025 has fallen to 2.1%, well within the bank\u2019s target range. With the economy shrinking for two consecutive months, the BoE has a clear path to begin easing its monetary policy.\nConversely, the BoJ is poised to hike its main policy rate to 0.75% on December 19, ending its long-standing negative interest rate policy. We\u2019ve seen Japan\u2019s core inflation remain above 2.5% for well over a year, and the strong 4% average wage growth confirmed earlier in 2025 gives the central bank confidence. This creates a fundamental reason for the Japanese Yen to strengthen significantly.\nThis developing policy divergence suggests the current uptrend in GBP/JPY is at high risk of a sharp reversal. We are already seeing a spike in implied volatility for GBP/JPY options expiring after next week\u2019s meetings, indicating traders are bracing for a large price swing. Using derivatives like put options to hedge long positions or to speculate on a downturn is a strategy worth considering.\nWe can look back to the divergence between the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve in 2014 for a historical parallel. When the ECB began easing while the Fed signaled tightening, it kicked off a major, year-long decline in the EUR/USD pair. The setup between the BoE and BoJ feels similar, suggesting that the current strength in GBP/JPY may be fragile."

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is hovering near 208.64, holding close to its highest level since August 2008 and on track for a fifth consecutive weekly gain.\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), weaker-than-expected growth data did little to dent Sterling\u2019s strength against the Yen, even as the Pound eased against other major counterparts. Data released earlier showed that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 0.1% MoM in October, undershooting expectations for a 0.1% expansion and matching the previous month\u2019s decline.\nLooking ahead, traders are turning their attention to the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) interest rate decision on December 18, with markets widely expecting a 25 basis point rate cut. Investors are currently assigning nearly a 90% probability that the BoE will lower its policy rate to 3.75%.\nIn Japan, the Yen\u2019s muted response reflects lingering skepticism over how far and how fast the BoJ is willing to tighten policy. Bloomberg reported earlier in the day that BoJ officials increasingly see next week\u2019s meeting as just the opening phase of a broader tightening cycle. According to people familiar with the matter, policymakers consider it likely that interest rates will rise above 0.75% before the current hiking cycle is over.\nA recent Reuters poll showed that around 90% of economists expect the central bank to raise its policy rate to 0.75% at the December 19 meeting. More than two-thirds of respondents also see rates climbing further to at least 1.00% by the end of next year.\nHowever, a separate report from Reuters suggests the BoJ is keen to avoid locking markets into a predefined tightening path. Sources familiar with the discussions said the central bank does not plan to release an updated estimate of the neutral interest rate, nor use it as a key communication tool to signal the timing or pace of future rate hikes.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

It also acquired more Bullish and Robinhood shares that day.\nArk's investment strategy aims to let no individual holding take up more than 10% of a fund's portfolio. This is to maintain diversification within its funds \u2014 meaning Ark is likely to continue rebalancing its weightings if the value of Coinbase shares rises or falls significantly relative to Ark's other holdings in its funds.\nAccording to the firm\u2019s disclosures, HOOD is currently the seventh-largest holding within its ARKK fund, with a weighting of 4.4%, worth around $351.6 million, as of Dec. 12, just behind Tempus AI.

Proponents in Congress argue that current regulations are archaic, denying millions of American savers access to modern asset classes.\nThe Counter-Narrative: Fiduciary Risk and Volatility\nCritics immediately pushed back, citing extreme volatility and fiduciary risks. The American Federation of Teachers has voiced strong opposition to similar measures, emphasizing the potential for fraud and the unsuitability of speculative assets for retirement security.\nFinancial analysts also share these concerns, pointing to the lack of long-term data and regulatory clarity. Warren Buffett has previously stated that Bitcoin produces no cash flow, making it more akin to gambling than a productive investment.\nThe Institutional Take\nWhile direct retail access is the headline, the institutional impact is greater. This congressional pressure is not merely about adding a Bitcoin ETF to a 401(k) menu. It is about forcing a legal and fiduciary reclassification of digital assets.\nIf the SEC acts, it could provide legal air cover for plan administrators and asset managers who have been hesitant to touch crypto due to litigation risk under ERISA.\nThis shifts the conversation from \u2018Is it allowed?\u2019 to \u2018What is the prudent allocation?\u2019. Expect asset managers to accelerate the development of institutionally-packaged crypto products designed specifically for the defined-contribution market, regardless of the SEC\u2019s immediate response.\n- Crypto Market Prospect: After the Washout, the Soil Looks Richer\n- [LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders\n- XRP Price Prediction: $100M Whale Dump Hits Just Before Breakout \u2013 Can Retail Buying Stop the Bleed?\n- XRP Price Prediction: Stellar Network Activity Booms \u2013 Could XRP Be Severely Underpriced Right Now?\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin, Solana by the End of 2025\nAbout Us\n2M+\n250+\n8\n70\nMarket Overview\n- 7d\n- 1m\n- 1y\n- Crypto Market Prospect: After the Washout, the Soil Looks Richer\n- [LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders\n- XRP Price Prediction: $100M Whale Dump Hits Just Before Breakout \u2013 Can Retail Buying Stop the Bleed?\n- XRP Price Prediction: Stellar Network Activity Booms \u2013 Could XRP Be Severely Underpriced Right Now?\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dog"

                "body": "- Bittensor's first halving is set to take place on December 14.\n- Investors hope it will boost the TAO token's price.\n- The reduced rewards will also impact the network's subnets and miners.\nThe Bittensor blockchain is on the verge of its first halving.\nLike Bitcoin, Bittensor is programmed to halve rewards of its native TAO token approximately every four years. Unlike Bitcoin, which halves based on block count, Bittensor\u2019s halving is triggered by the total supply of TAO tokens.\nOnce the network has distributed 10.5 million TAO \u2014 half of Bittensor\u2019s 21 million total supply \u2014 the number of newly created tokens will drop from 7,200 TAO per day to 3,600.\nAt the current rate of inflation, that\u2019s set to happen on December 14 at around 3:30 am London time.\nInvestors are hopeful the event will give the network a much-needed boost.\nSupportive environment\nThe TAO token has fallen some 47% over the past year, dragged down by a stagnating crypto market.\n\u201cWhen inflation falls and demand stays steady, the environment becomes more supportive for long-term price appreciation,\u201d Arrash Yasavolian, founder of Taoshi, a firm focused on leveraging the Bittensor blockchain, told DL News.\n\u201cHistorically, networks with halving mechanisms see stronger long-term performance because supply contracts as usage grows.\u201d\nYet such an outcome isn\u2019t guaranteed.\nEven with the amount of new TAO entering circulation decreasing, it can take time before it has an impact on the token\u2019s price \u2014 if at all.\nMacroeconomic factors, such as President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing trade wars and slower-than-anticipated interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, are weighing on the broader crypto market, hampering prices across the market.\n\u2018Zombie\u2019 subnets starve\nBittensor is a blockchain network designed to offer an alternative to centrally controlled artificial intelligence powerhouses like OpenAI and Google.\nThe network enables anyone to contribute their computing power to AI applications, known as subnets. These entities are usually referred to as miners.\nIn return, those miners are rewarded with TAO tokens, similar to how the Bitcoin blockchain rewards those who process transactions with new Bitcoins.\nThe subnet economy will be shaken up after those rewards are slashed by 50%.\n\u201cWe expect a \u2018flight to quality\u2019 where capital aggressively condenses into the few subnets generating real revenue, while the \u2018zombie\u2019 subnets starve,\u201d Karia Samaroo, founder of xTAO, a crypto treasury company focused on accumulating TAO tokens, told DL News.\nTightening margins\nJust as with Bitcoin, the halving will also squeeze the miners who contribute their computing power to Bittensor.\nBitcoin block rewards halving from 6.25 to 3.125 in April 2024 has forced many miners to diversify into artificial intelligence and seek out cheaper sources of energy to power their machines in a bid to remain profitable.\nSamaroo expects the same for Bittensor.\n\u201cWe expect margins to tighten temporarily, forcing a consolidation of hash power toward the most performant actors,\u201d he said.\nThe halving will introduce more turbulence into the four-year-old Bittensor blockchain. Yet its proponents say it will make the network stronger in the long run.\n\u201cThe combined effect is a healthier and more efficient ecosystem,\u201d Yasavolian said.\n\u201cInflation drops, emissions become more selective, and resources move toward subnets that generate value with stronger economics.\u201d\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": "Key Takeaways\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has long been celebrated for its decentralization, innovation, and role as the backbone of decentralized finance. But what happens when a single entity quietly accumulates enough ETH to control 5% of its entire supply, potentially? Enter BitMine Immersion Technologies.\nLed by crypto strategist Tom Lee, BitMine has embarked on a sweeping acquisition campaign. By December 2025, the company held roughly 3-3.2% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply, about 3.6-3.9 million coins, and publicly set a target of 5%, or nearly 6 million ETH. For perspective, that\u2019s a sum larger than many decentralized staking pools, dwarfing almost all corporate treasuries in the cryptocurrency space.\nThe implications of such concentrated ownership are profound. From price surges and staking dominance to liquidity crunches and governance influence, BitMine\u2019s ETH strategy could reshape the ecosystem, for better or worse.\nThe first, most obvious effect of BitMine cornering 5% of ETH is a supply shock. Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply is already thin on exchanges, hovering near all-time lows. Large holders have been quietly withdrawing coins from exchanges, thereby reducing available liquidity.\nBitMine\u2019s accumulation amplifies this trend, meaning that even modest buying or selling can significantly swing prices.\nHistorically, crypto markets respond to scarcity predictably: less supply meets steady demand, prices climb. Bitcoin provides a perfect parallel. In 2021, institutional accumulation and dwindling exchange reserves helped fuel massive rallies. Ethereum could follow a similar path if scarcity intensifies.\nIf ETH prices double, from around $3,000 to $6,000, the market cap would effectively double. Tom Lee has suggested that under favorable conditions, ETH could reach $9,000-$12,000 by late 2025, with a \u201csupercycle\u201d scenario potentially pushing prices above $60,000 over the longer term.\nHowever, concentrated ownership also amplifies volatility. Fewer coins circulating means smaller trades can cause outsized price moves. A single large sale, a pause in buying, or a forced liquidation could ripple across the market, causing dramatic swings.\nKey implications include:\nEthereum\u2019s Proof-of-stake (PoS) network transforms ETH into a yield-bearing asset. With 5% of the supply, BitMine would likely stake most of its holdings, becoming one of the largest validators globally.\nCurrently, the top 10 staking entities control nearly half of all staked ETH, and adding BitMine\u2019s potential 6 million ETH would reshape the validator environment.\nStaking rewards, currently 3-5% annually, could net BitMine 150,000-200,000 ETH per year, compounding their holdings. The firm\u2019s MAVAN validator network could rival or surpass major existing pools, giving BitMine a voice in consensus decisions, client diversity, and governance upgrades.\nWhile institutional staking brings stability and professional infrastructure, it also raises centralization concerns. Ethereum\u2019s decentralized design assumes distributed control; a single corporate entity holding 5% of total supply and a significant portion of staked ETH challenges that ethos:\nRemoving millions of ETH from circulation affects more than just price; it reshapes the liquidity environment. Exchanges will hold thinner order books, meaning larger trades face higher slippage. Wider spreads make trading more expensive, and the market becomes sensitive to even moderate buying or selling pressure.\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) would feel the pressure acutely. ETH serves as collateral, liquidity for automated market makers (AMMs), and the base for lending and borrowing.\nScarcity could push borrowing rates higher, increase liquidation risk, and reduce AMM depth, making swaps more costly. Even seemingly small adjustments by large holders could create cascading effects, highlighting the fragility of a market increasingly dominated by a few whales.\nAt the same time, BitMine could act as a stabili"

                "body": "Ethereum saw a massive rally after it broke out of the descending price channel, shooting from $3,100 to $3,400 in a matter of hours as short sellers were squeezed out of the market. Volumes have risen to near $30 billion, and market sentiment strongly favors the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Now that the technical analysis for Ethereum is bullish and the recent improvements on the technology front have enhanced the platform\u2019s scalability and appeal, analysts think that a recovery of the $3,500 level is imminent.\nThis momentum continues, and the attention of investors is also growing for an ETH-based new crypto, named Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasingly seen among the best cryptos to invest in right now for those focusing on the DeFi segment.\nEthereum Sees Breakout Opportunity As Bullish Sentiment Amplified\nEthereum is up over 8% in the last 24 hours, thanks to increasing liquidity and the overall sentiment shift among markets towards risk on. It appears that over $260 million worth of shorts were unwound within four hours when the price of ETH burst through critical resistance. It appears that the 200-day EMA for the token has been breached, which is a very reliable indicator of a long-term trend change.\nThe momentum indicators are also bullish, with the RSI above the average for the 14-day period, which is usually the buy signal given by institutional traders. Ethereum, following the upgrade by both Fusaka and Pectra, has lower transacting costs and higher transactions per second, which improves its competitive advantage at a time when institutional investments are rising. If the $3,500 level is breached, analysts expect the market to trigger a recovery, with estimates indicating a possible target of $4,000.\nMutuum Finance: The Best Cryptocurrency To Invest In For Access To DeFi Market\nWith the Ethereum rebound lighting the way for the next big thing in crypto, the name that keeps popping up among the ranks of the next big thing is none other than Mutuum Finance, better known by the ticker MUTM. With the goal of providing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that excels on the level of capital efficiency, real yield, and the transparent nature of their liquidation model on the Ethereum platform, the premise of the project truly speaks for itself.\nMutuum\u2019s presale is currently at phase 6, and the data demonstrates increasing momentum: $19,280,000 raised and 18,450 total holders since the project\u2019s inception. The current price at phase 6 is $0.035, indicating a steep 250% increase since the initial entry price of $0.01 during phase 1. However, with the current phase 6 already 98% sold out, it is the last call for buyers to get their hands on the tokens before the price spikes by nearly 20% to $0.04 in phase 7. The launch price for the new token, MUTM, is $0.06, indicating that current buyers will get a whopping 360% return when the token is goes live.\nOne of the main factors contributing to the adoption of the protocol is the implementation of the new dashboard for the Mutuum protocol. This new platform features a leaderboard of the top 50 account holders, with the number one-ranked user receiving a $500 MUTM reward every day that a transaction is made.\nSecurity is also among the areas that have received heavy attention, with Halborn Security already undertaking a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts of Mutuum. This will help enhance the confidence of the investors, especially when the protocol is ready for launch.\nAs the benefits of Phase 6 are almost exhausted, with the next price increase for $0.04 imminent, the time for a discounted entry into the market for MUTM is running out. Those looking for the next big thing in the cryptocurrency arena for the growth of the DeFi space might not get a better opportunity.\nFor more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

                "body": "In the fast-paced realm of decentralized finance, something remarkable is happening. Enter the Byreal platform, not just a contender, but a vibrant force reshaping the decentralized exchange (DEX) paradigm within the Solana ecosystem. In a breathtakingly short span of 10 weeks post its mainnet unveiling, Byreal has already eclipsed a monumental cumulative trading volume of over $1 billion, revealing a seismic shift in cryptocurrency trading dynamics. This impressive feat underscores the potential of hybrid DEXs to merge the robustness of centralized exchange-grade liquidity with the essence of transparency and user-centric community values that define genuine decentralized finance.\nThe Emergence of Hybrid DEXs and What Lies Ahead for DeFi\nByreal\u2019s meteoric rise to $1.07 billion in trading volume showcases a strategy bursting with innovation. Thanks to key alliances, particularly with Bybit, this platform has effectively carved out a substantial niche in the market. Continuously ranking among the Solana DEX frontrunners, Byreal flaunts a total value locked (TVL) of $10.88 million. This success story not only affirms that hybrid strategies can uphold the foundational tenets of DeFi but also invigorate user participation. Features like Copy Farming\u2014which empowers traders to mirror the successful moves of their peers\u2014foster a vibrant trading environment, enticing users who are keen to harness maximum liquidity opportunities.\nTransformative Potential of On-chain Real Assets for Investors\nA pivotal aspect of Byreal\u2019s innovation is its groundbreaking ability to incorporate premium real-world assets into its ecosystem, exemplified by offerings like tokenized gold. This integration elevates the investment experience by providing tangible returns, thereby addressing a critical void in a crypto landscape that often overlooks traditional asset classes. Analytical insights suggest that embracing real assets on-chain is vital for maintaining long-term investor appeal and stabilizing crypto market revenues. By marrying accessible digital trading with the security of recognized traditional assets, Byreal is cultivating a novel investment ethos where crypto harmonizes with established financial paradigms.\nConfronting the Challenges of DeFi\nYet, even as Byreal shines brightly, it navigates the murky waters of DeFi familiar to many in the sector. The dependence on partnerships, like that with Bybit, raises significant questions about the core values of decentralization and the very integrity of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within the Web3 landscape. As regulatory pressures intensify\u2014particularly for offshore operations\u2014Byreal faces not only the need for technological innovation but also must adapt to compliance demands. Research indicates that ignoring these regulations could undermine trust and threaten the very sustainability of decentralized platforms.\nThe Bridge Between TradFi and DeFi\nByreal\u2019s forward-thinking approach acts as an essential bridge uniting traditional finance (TradFi) with the emerging tides of DeFi liquidity. The shift towards institutional-grade frameworks within decentralized finance is crucial as institutional players weigh the merits of entering the crypto realm. Such connections promise not just increased market stability, but also the potential to temper the volatility that has long been synonymous with cryptocurrency markets.\nThe Bright Horizon for Solana's DEX Landscape\nByreal\u2019s impressive milestones might well establish a new benchmark for hybrid DEXs in the Solana ecosystem. With a keen focus on merging yields from real-world assets and collaborating with established financial institutions, Byreal crafts a compelling narrative that beckons cautious investors. By paying attention to the regulatory nuances of traditional finance, the platform stands to gain the trust of those wary of cryptocurrency\u2019s inherent fluctuations.

                "body": "Major stock indexes fell Friday as technology shares remained under pressure on AI bubble fears. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average pulled back from records.\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average set an intraday record high for a second straight session soon after markets opened but reversed course and ended the session down 0.5%. The S&P 500, which like the Dow set an all-time closing high Thursday, fell 1.1%, while the Nasdaq dropped 1.7%.\nThe Dow still managed to post gains for a third straight week, rising just over 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each came into Friday's session higher for the week, but ended up declining over the five days. The indexes had received a boost Wednesday when the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate for the third consecutive meeting.\nFears of an AI bubble returned to markets in recent days after disappointing earnings reports from cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) and chip designer Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom shares, which traded at a record high as recently as Wednesday, plunged 11% today, while Oracle dropped 4.5%, adding to the previous session's 11% slide.\nChip stocks were among the hardest hit on Friday. Shares of AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable publicly traded company, fell more than 3%, while Micron Technology (MU) gave up nearly 7% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) retreated about 5%.\nOne bright note Friday was Lululemon Athletica (LULU), whose shares jumped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 advancers after the athleisure retailer reported better-than-expected results and announced that CEO Calvin McDonald will step aside at the end of January. The stock had lost more than half its value this year entering the session.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, rose to 4.19% from 4.14% at Thursday's close. The yield hit a three-month high of 4.21% on Wednesday before the Fed announced its rate cut.\nBitcoin was around $90,400 in late-afternoon trading, down from the day's high of more than $93,500. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, ticked higher to 98.39 after posting its lowest closing level since mid-October yesterday.\nGold futures advanced 0.4% to $4,330 an ounce after earlier approaching their all-time high of $4,398 set on Oct. 10. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down 0.1% at $57.50 a barrel.\nA Bad Week for Oracle Stock Got Worse on Friday\nA bad week for software maker Oracle (ORCL) ended on a sour note.\nBloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Oracle had delayed by a year the delivery of some data centers it's developing for ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The delays were caused by material and labor shortages, according to Bloomberg.\nThe report weighed on Oracle's shares, already under pressure following the release of its results earlier in the week, pulling them another 4.5% lower Friday to levels not seen since June.\nThe company in a statement said \"all milestones remain on track.\"\n\"There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments,\u201d an Oracle spokesperson told Investopedia. \u201cWe remain fully aligned with OpenAI and confident in our ability to execute against both our contractual commitments and future expansion plans.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s losses extended Oracle stock\u2019s Thursday drop, when shares tumbled nearly 11% after the company\u2019s quarterly earnings fell short of expectations and revived concerns about its AI ambitions.\nOracle is aggressively investing in AI infrastructure to compete with cloud computing incumbents Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). However, unlike its largest competitors, whose profits are paying for their data center projects, Oracle is borrowing heavily. Some investors are concerned the company will struggle to repay its debt if AI demand falls short of expectations"

                "body": "US stocks turned sharply lower on Friday, with the Nasdaq leading the way lower amid a broader rotation from tech to value names.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1.6%, continuing a tech slump. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 1%, one day after surging above the 6,900 level for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, slipped 0.5%.\nFriday's moves cemented a brutal week for tech stocks in particular, with the Nasdaq down 1.6% and the S&P 500 down 1%. The Dow bucked the weekly trend, rising 1% for the week.\n(^DJI)\nTreasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield (^TNX) stepping higher to top 4.18% and the 30-year yield (^TYX) rising above 4.85%.\nInvestors are switching out of tech as fears about AI over-valuations get a reboot, as Broadcom (AVGO) followed Oracle (ORCL) in delivering earnings that left Wall Street wanting more. The chipmaker failed to deliver clarity on an AI payoff, stirring concerns about tighter profit margins instead. Its shares dropped over 10% Friday, despite its quarterly earnings beat.\nAt the same time, cyclical stocks \u2014 those more sensitive to the economy \u2014 got a bid following the Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut of the year. The expected easing comes amid rising optimism for US growth, helping drive broader bullishness for stocks. The rate cut also helped drive gold prices (GC=F) to touch a fresh record as the precious metal is set for its best year since 1979.\nLate Friday, President Trump indicated he considers Kevin Hassett the frontrunner for the next Fed chair after Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Trump said Kevin Warsh is also in contention for the role, which has been closely watched for its influence on monetary policy next year.\nOn the corporate front, Lululemon (LULU) shares surged more than 9% after the athletic wear maker said CEO Calvin McDonald will exit at the end of January following a stretch of disappointing sales.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 20 updatesBroadcom results highlight fears over profitability of AI hardware sellers\nGoogle's (GOOG) chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) posted quarterly results after the bell that broadly beat Wall Street's expectations as orders from leading AI developer Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) surged to $21 billion. But profitability concerns are driving the stock down, analysts said Friday.\nHistorically, most semiconductor makers operated like commodity businesses, as products were relatively undifferentiated, competition was intense, and profit margins were thin.\nThe emergence of AI chips changed that dynamic. A small number of companies \u2014 particularly Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 control the market with highly specialized chips that are in exceptionally high demand and short supply, allowing them to command premium prices and earn unusually high margins.\nBut as more competitors enter the AI chip market and supply increases, some analysts worry that the economics could eventually start to resemble traditional semiconductor markets again, where chips behave more like commodities, companies' pricing power weakens, and their profits decline.\n\"While all of these AI revenue figures are surging higher, the cost of this growth comes on margins...\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore of Broadcom's results in a note to clients Friday.\nBroadcom guided for a gross margin of 76.9% for the current (January) quarter, which would mark a decline from 79% in the year-ago period. It would also be a step down from 77.9% in the fourth quarter and 78.3% in the third quarter \u2014 although these figures still represent extremely high profitability.\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote USD(AVGO)\n359.93-46.44(-11.43%)At close: December 12 at 4:00:02 PM ESTParticularly, investors are worried Broadcom's additional $11 billion worth of orders from AI developer Anthropic for server racks equipped with Google's TPUs will have lower margins due to high pass-through costs (Broadcom is passing its manufacturing costs for the TPUs directly to Anthropic, without addin"

A warning about margins from chipmaker Broadcom AVGO added to the concerns.\nThe move had a limited impact on wider risk appetite on Thursday, as the S&P 500 and Dow still hit record highs. But on Friday, Wall Street futures were down during Asian trading and struggled to make gains during European trading.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, in a 9-3 split decision, leaving traders optimistic about more cuts in 2026, even though policymakers signalled that it will put further reductions on pause for now.\nAt 1248 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2% on the day, having hit its highest in a month SXXP.

The ECB is expected to keep them steady, although traders are now speculating it could hike rates in 2026. The BoJ is expected to hike rates after strong signals from Governor Kazuo Ueda.\nDOLLAR STEADY, POUND FALLS SLIGHTLY ON UK DATA\nThe U.S. dollar was steady, with the dollar index up around 0.2% on the day at 98.527 DXY.\nStill, it was within reach of the previous session's low, which was the lowest in nearly eight weeks, and on track for a third weekly decline in a row.\nIt has taken a hit from the Fed's less-hawkish-than-expected outlook on rates, as well as U.S. jobless claims data, which showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years last week.\nThe euro was down 0.2% at $1.1719 EURUSD and sterling was down 0.2% on the day at $1.3362 GBPUSD, falling only slightly after data showing that Britain's economy shrank by 0.1% in the three months to December in the run-up to the UK budget.\nGermany's government bond yields rose, on track for their largest weekly rise since March, as traders started to price in a rise in euro zone rates following comments from influential ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel earlier in the week. The 10-year Germany government bond yield was at 2.861% (DE10YT=RR).\nOIL FALLS, COPPER HITS RECORD HIGH\nOil prices fell as traders worried about oversupply and a possible Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Concerns about disruptions to supply in Venezuela had supported oil prices earlier in the session, as the U.S. prepares to intercept more ships transporting Venezuelan oil.\nUkraine's government bonds rallied after the country sent the United States a revised proposal for ending the war with Russia.\nInvestors are also watching the progress of European Union proposals to use frozen Russian assets, many of which are held at Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear.\nLeaders of the \"Coalition of the Willing\" group of nations said they discussed progress over the plan in a virtual meeting on Thursday. Russia's central bank said on Friday the plan was illegal.\nCopper"

But profitability concerns are driving the stock down, analysts said Friday.\nHistorically, most semiconductor makers operated like commodity businesses, as products were relatively undifferentiated, competition was intense, and profit margins were thin.\nThe emergence of AI chips changed that dynamic. A small number of companies \u2014 particularly Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 control the market with highly specialized chips that are in exceptionally high demand and short supply, allowing them to command premium prices and earn unusually high margins.\nBut as more competitors enter the AI chip market and supply increases, some analysts worry that the economics could eventually start to resemble traditional semiconductor markets again, where chips behave more like commodities, companies' pricing power weakens, and their profits decline.\n\"While all of these AI revenue figures are surging higher, the cost of this growth comes on margins...\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore of Broadcom's results in a note to clients Friday.\nBroadcom guided for a gross margin of 76.9% for the current (January) quarter, which would mark a decline from 79% in the year-ago period. It would also be a step down from 77.9% in the fourth quarter and 78.3% in the third quarter \u2014 although these figures still represent extremely high profitability.\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote USD(AVGO)\n359.93-46.44(-11.43%)At close: December 12 at 4:00:02 PM ESTParticularly, investors are worried Broadcom's additional $11 billion worth of orders from AI developer Anthropic for server racks equipped with Google's TPUs will have lower margins due to high pass-through costs (Broadcom is passing its manufacturing costs for the TPUs directly to Anthropic, without addin"

That would mark the first consensus-backed rate increase in decades under Governor Kazuo Ueda. Experts are split on what happens next: some predict a steady step-up every six months, while others see a faster or slower climb, with most forecasts peaking around 1.25%. Japan\u2019s economic data is pointing up \u2013 industrial production and shipments rose in October and have improved from last year. On the stock market, financial names like Sony Financial Group surged after a major bond deal, Terra Drone rallied on corporate transparency, and Renova slipped even though electricity sales jumped, just missing internal targets.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Japan\u2019s big policy pivot is shaking up expectations.\nIf the Bank of Japan pulls the trigger on a rate hike, it could end years of negative rates and reset the playing field for banks, insurers, exporters, and the yen. A move like this tends to boost financial-sector profits, but it could also spark currency swings and reshape global investment flows. With investors already piling into financial and tech stocks, the market\u2019s pricing in both fresh opportunities and new risks.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s shift could ripple across global markets.\nWhile the US and Europe are pausing rate hikes, Japan\u2019s potential move stands out \u2013 and could refocus global attention on Japanese assets. The country\u2019s consistent industrial growth is giving policymakers cause for optimism, but past mistakes mean the central bank will likely tread carefully.

                "body": "A powerful offshore earthquake late on Monday, December 8, has rattled northeastern Japan and global markets \u2014 but, so far, not Japan\u2019s stock indices. As of market close on Tuesday, December 9, the Nikkei 225 is still trading near record highs, and early assessments suggest the direct economic damage will be limited unless stronger aftershocks hit.\nThis article pulls together the latest information from December 9, 2025, and looks at how the quake may affect Japan\u2019s economy and stock prices in the days and months ahead.\n1. What happened: the 2025 Sanriku earthquake in brief\nLate on Monday night, a magnitude 7.5\u20137.6 earthquake struck off Japan\u2019s Sanriku coast, near Aomori Prefecture:\n- The quake occurred at 11:15 p.m. local time (14:15 UTC) on December 8, with the epicenter about 80 km off Aomori at a depth of ~54 km, according to Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency (JMA) and USGS. [1]\n- Shaking reached \u201cupper 6\u201d on JMA\u2019s 1\u20137 scale in Hachinohe, strong enough to make it impossible to stand without support. [2]\n- Initial tsunami warnings of waves up to 3 meters were issued for parts of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, but the actual tsunamis measured 20\u201370 cm at several ports. All warnings and advisories were lifted by early Tuesday. [3]\nBy midday Tuesday, authorities reported:\n- At least ~30\u201333 people injured in northern Japan; one confirmed house fire. [4]\n- Around 90,000 residents evacuated at the peak of the tsunami warning, with thousands taking shelter in schools, bases and public halls. [5]\n- Road damage and localized infrastructure disruption in Aomori and Hokkaido: collapsed sections of road, at least one car swallowed by a sinkhole, scattered broken glass and some damaged buildings, including hotels. [6]\n- Temporary power outages for a few thousand households; electricity was largely restored by Tuesday morning. [7]\n- Bullet trains and some local rail services suspended in northern Japan for safety checks. [8]\n- No abnormalities at nuclear plants (including Higashidori and Onagawa), according to operators and regulators. [9]\nCrucially, USGS estimates the direct economic impact as \u201csignificant but not catastrophic\u201d: its models place the earthquake in the YELLOW damage band, suggesting a high probability that losses remain under USD 1 billion and most likely in the USD 1\u201310 million range. [10]\nFor a nearly USD 4\u20135 trillion economy, that implies a very small direct hit, assuming no much larger aftershock occurs.\n2. First impact on markets: Nikkei shrugs, yen wobbles\nTokyo stocks: near record highs despite the quake\nIf you only looked at the Nikkei 225 on Tuesday, you might not guess Japan had just experienced a major quake:\n- The Nikkei 225 closed at 50,651.75, up about 0.14% on December 9, according to the official index provider and market wrap-ups. TechStock\u00b2\n- The TOPIX index hovered around 3,386, essentially flat on the day. TechStock\u00b2+1\n- Mid-morning, Reuters reported that the Nikkei was down less than 0.1% and the TOPIX about 0.1% as investors trimmed risk ahead of this week\u2019s U.S. Federal Reserve decision \u2014 but the market later clawed back to end slightly higher. [11]\nMultiple Reuters-based reports note that \u201cJapan\u2019s stock market shrugged off Monday\u2019s powerful offshore earthquake\u201d, with traders more focused on the Fed meeting and a potential Bank of Japan rate hike next week than on quake-related losses. [12]\nIn other words:\nSo far, the earthquake has not knocked Japanese equities off course. Tokyo remains close to record territory after hitting an all-time high above 52,600 in early November. [13]\nThe yen and global risk sentiment\nOutside Japan, the quake showed up more clearly in FX and global risk sentiment:\n- The yen weakened modestly after the news, with the dollar climbing about 0.3\u20130.4% against it at one point, and USD/JPY trading around 155\u2013156. [14]\n- The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) fell around 0.6% on Monday in U.S. trading as investors weighed possible economic spillovers. [15]\n- U.S. 10\u2011year Treasury yields tick"
