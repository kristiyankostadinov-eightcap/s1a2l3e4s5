The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2% to also notch a fresh record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.3%. The three indexes began Monday's session sharply lower but turned around by late morning.\n(^DJI)\nOther pockets of markets showed more effects from the Fed fight, with gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) surging to records as investors flocked to safer havens. Bonds ticked lower. The US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) also fell.\nRattled markets took in the drama as Powell said the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed, threatening criminal charges over his testimony on building renovations. In a strongly worded statement, Powell said the action is an escalation of President Trump's campaign to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates.\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell wrote, describing the concerns cited in the subpoenas as \"pretexts.\"\nIn corporates, bank and other financial services stocks slumped thanks to a warning to credit card issuers from Trump. Lenders will be \"in violation of the law\" if they don't cap interest rates at 10%, he told reporters on Sunday. Shares of Capital One (COF) slid 7% to lead early trading losses. Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) also fell in a downbeat start to a week when big US banks will kick off earnings season.\nThe unsettled mood comes as investors get ready for this week's updates on inflation in December, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading due on Tuesday.

                "body": "The relationship between gold prices and the dollar: Everything to know\nInvestors have long viewed gold as a steady hedge during periods of economic uncertainty, but its role in today's markets is evolving rapidly. Recent shifts in monetary policy, stubborn inflation risks and rising geopolitical tensions have all reshaped how investors think about safety, value and long-term protection, and have pushed traditional market relationships to their limits.\nAgainst that backdrop, gold's recent price behavior has been anything but ordinary. After breaking through key price thresholds in 2024 and 2025 \u2014 first $3,000 per ounce, then $4,000 \u2014 the price of the precious metal has continued climbing in 2026, recently surpassing $4,600 per ounce and setting a string of new all-time highs. What once looked like a cyclical upswing now resembles a sustained re-rating of gold's place in the global financial system.\nA combination of persistent central-bank buying, shifting rate expectations and changing investor attitudes toward risk has helped keep gold's momentum intact. Perhaps most surprising, though, is how the metal has behaved alongside a relatively strong U.S. dollar, challenging long-held assumptions and leaving many investors wondering what comes next. Below, we'll break down what investors should know now.\nWanted to invest in gold now that the price is climbing? Get started here now.\nThe relationship between gold prices and the dollar\nBelow, experts break down why the price of gold keeps climbing and the precious metal's complex relationship with the dollar.\nWhy gold prices have been climbing\n\"Gold can be a valuable asset in a portfolio precisely because it has [a] low correlation with other asset classes,\" emphasizes Ben Nadelstein, head of content at Monetary Metals.\nThis independence from traditional market patterns has caught investors' attention, especially as the economy faces increasing uncertainty. The appeal of gold's unique behavior has helped drive its impressive price climb, but it's not the only factor at work. Industry professionals highlight other forces that have pushed gold prices higher:\nCentral bank buying: Central banks have dramatically increased their gold reserves in recent years and continue to do so.Investor sentiment: More investors are adding gold to diversify their portfolios amid inflationary and financial stability concerns.De-dollarization: The BRICS+ nations are reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar.Market evolution: Gold prices now respond to a broader range of global economic factors.\nHow gold prices typically move with the dollar\nHenry Yoshida, co-founder of Rocket Dollar, highlights that gold prices and the U.S. dollar traditionally move in opposite directions.\nAdvertisement\n\"A stronger U.S. dollar will suppress the price of gold, while a weaker U.S. dollar will likely drive the price of gold higher through increased demand,\" Yoshida says.\nBut Michael Petch, co-founder and president of Argo Digital Gold, points out that this relationship isn't absolute.\n\"[When there's] financial instability, gold and the dollar may [go up as people] seek safe-haven assets,\" Petch says.\nThe complex interplay between gold and the dollar\n\"Large-scale government accumulation has added a demand-side force that can push [gold] prices higher, even in a strong-dollar environment,\" Petch says.\nBeyond this influence, Kevin Bryan, director of customer experience at The Alloy Market, points to several often-overlooked factors that create a more nuanced dynamic:\nSupply limits: Mining strikes and environmental regulations can restrict gold production. As a result, gold prices may go up, even if the dollar is strong.Geopolitical risks: Rising global tensions and trade disputes create uncertainty. Naturally, this drives people to invest in safe-haven assets such as gold.Inflation concerns: Investors may turn to precious metals, including gold and silver, to hedge against inflation, regardless of current dollar strength.Digi"

Silver jumped nearly 7% from Fridays close to trade near $85, while gold, up 2.2%, set a new record high of $4,600.\nThe rally in precious metals was catalyzed by an unprecedented political crisis at the Federal Reserve, following the Department of Justices lawsuit against Chair Jerome Powell. \"Gold and silver moved higher as markets leaned back into safe-haven positioning amid rising geopolitical risk and renewed uncertainty around U.S. monetary policy credibility,\" Wenny Cai, COO at Synfutures, told Decrypt.

This would undermine OPEC\u2019s influence on the global oil markets, analysts say.\nAny meaningful recovery of Venezuela\u2019s oil supply, which is currently at less than 1% of global daily demand, would need billions of U.S. dollars, probably upwards of $100 billion, in investments, and years to take hold.

                "body": "Breadcrumb\nWhat Trump's oil gamble in Venezuela could mean for OPEC\nIf Washington secures access to Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves, its geopolitical hand would be strengthened considerably. Folded into existing US and Canadian output, oil from the Latin American country would bring close to 40% of global supply within America\u2019s strategic orbit.\nAnd if President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to bring the Western Hemisphere\u2019s oil production under US influence succeeds, it could end up overseeing more crude than OPEC, a global body of petroleum-exporting countries.\nOriginally founded by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela in 1960, and now comprising Algeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria, and the UAE, OPEC\u2019s power rests on managing output to maintain profitability, while preserving market stability.\nThe rise of a rival production hub managed by the US could erode this leverage, potentially pushing oil prices below desired OPEC levels - such as $50 per barrel - as Washington gains more control over the global market.\nAnd if American-led producers keep output high, OPEC\u2019s coordinated production cuts may no longer be relevant. A divided oil market could reduce the influence of OPEC, while its \u2018energy diplomacy\u2019, long used to build partnerships and have a say in global affairs, would carry less weight.\nThough a US hold over oil production in the Western Hemisphere would not collapse OPEC, it could shake the foundation of oil-dependent economic models. For OPEC members like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iraq, the slightest drop in their oil revenue directly impacts their national budget.\nEven a moderate spell of lower oil prices could directly shrink government revenues, limit fiscal space, complicate spending commitments, and affect political stability. To mitigate these risks, GCC states have been proactively pursuing economic diversification strategies to reduce hydrocarbon revenue, but they still need more time.\nWhat are Washington's plans for Venezuela's oil?\nInitially, the US plans to sell 50 million barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil (which it says will be turned over by Caracas\u2019s interim authorities) valued at about $2.5 billion.\nWhile analysts expect it may take months before any impact is seen from this supply, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said that the oil will be arriving \u201cvery soon\u201d.\nAccording to US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, after the crude currently in storage gets sold, Washington plans to sell Venezuelan oil \u201cindefinitely\u201d, allowing it to flow \u201caround the world to bring better oil supplies\u201d. With around 303 billion barrels worth of proven oil reserves, Venezuela has about 17% of the global total, more than Saudi Arabia, which has 267 billion barrels.\nIntensive discussions are taking place with major US oil companies like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips, about expanding their licenses and ramping up refining and exports from Venezuela. Top energy CEOs were invited to the White House last week, but while most of them expressed interest, they wanted serious guarantees before getting involved in Venezuela.\nMajor companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are still stuck in prior drilling disputes there. Consequently, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said that the country is \u201cun-investible\u201d. However, Chevron (the last American company still operating in Venezuela) was willing to raise its output as it is already producing almost 240,000 barrels a day with a Venezuelan partnership.\nThough hurdles remain for US oil giants, there is optimism in the market. As Tony Franjie, head of energy fundamentals at SynMax Intelligence, said recently, US intervention could \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the oil market as American oil companies could speed up Venezuelan production, paving the way for \u201csub-$50 WTI\u201d.\nInterestingly, most US Gulf Coast refineries were originally built to process \u201cheavy\u201d crude oil, the same as Venezuelan crude, so this type of oil remains w"

                "body": "US shale-oil producers were already contending with oil prices at four-year lows. News that they may soon face a significant competitor in their back yard probably wasn\u2019t how frackers wanted to greet 2026.\nThe US capture of Venezuela\u2019s President Nicola\u00e1 Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, hit the share prices of independent shale-oil producers, such as Diamondback Energy and Devon Energy, last week.\nOver the last 20 years, the US fracking industry has built itself into the main driver of domestic oil production: it accounted for 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023. With average production levels of 13.6m barrels a day (BPD), the US is the world\u2019s largest crude-oil producer.\nIt will take years for Venezuela\u2019s production to ramp up, limiting the near-term impact on US suppliers, but Donald Trump has made clear he wants firms to move quickly.\nThe development comes at a difficult time for the industry, which is pressured by a global glut of oil. Higher supplies come from an unwinding of 2023 voluntary production cuts by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and growth in non-Opec countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China and Guyana.\nOil prices have been trending down since passing $100 in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. With supply overwhelming demand, nearby Nymex West Texas Intermediate crude-oil futures prices \u2013 agreed rates for assets to be bought at a later date \u2013 are trading at about $56 a barrel. Longer-dated futures contracts for the US oil benchmark forecast prices range between $56 and $57 a barrel until June 2028.\nUS fracking is expensive, so the industry will not welcome more price pressures. Potentially, this is a threat to Republicans who have championed fracking in swing states like Pennsylvania, where the shale revolution has been an economic boon.\nFor now, the picture is as murky as a barrel of oil.\nRob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, says any impact Venezuela has on US producers is a matter of timing. The US oil market is currently \u201cacting like a reasonably supplied market with expectations that supply continues to increase, which keeps dampening those oil prices\u201d, he said.\nWhether Venezuelan production resumes as projected is debatable, but one saving grace for US producers is that Venezuelan oil is heavy, and requires more processing than the light oil the US pumps. That makes Venezuelan petroleum less of a competitive threat to the US, since refiners globally can use light oil, says Peter McNally, global head of sector analysts at Third Bridge. Still, Venezuela\u2019s potential output adds to the growing global glut.\nThe economics of US oil production, when oil is about $57 a barrel, are troublesome in the longer term. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that break-even prices for existing wells, in both shale and non-shale production, are between $26 and $45 a barrel, but that break-even rises to between $61 and $70 for any newly drilled wells.\nDespite sluggish returns, the shale-oil industry is in better shape than in 2020. Producers\u2019 balance sheets were already laden with debt when prices briefly turned negative during the Covid lockdown, says Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.\nMany smaller producers went bankrupt. Those that survived started to focus on generating cashflow and return on invested capital, rather than hiking production. That capital discipline means companies are in better fiscal shape to weather lower oil prices, and are likely to keep a close eye on the bottom line, Thummel says. \u201cWhat that means is they\u2019re going to cut back on spending and [rein in] production.\u201d\nThe difficult times in 2020 ushered in consolidation, and the industry became dominated by oil majors like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rather than the independent producers that started up during the initial hydraulic fracturing oil boom in the early aughts. Sustained lower prices could spe"

This would undermine OPEC\u2019s influence on the global oil markets, analysts say.\nAny meaningful recovery of Venezuela\u2019s oil supply, which is currently at less than 1% of global daily demand, would need billions of U.S. dollars, probably upwards of $100 billion, in investments, and years to take hold. And that\u2019s considering that there will be solid new legal frameworks and security guarantees that would give assurances to potential investors that they would not face another asset seizure and nationalization.\nRelated: Is Iraq About to Make Its Biggest Geopolitical Pivot in Years?\nPresident Trump\u2019s plan to have U.S. firms invest in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector recovery was not met with enthusiasm by the executives of the top U.S. oil firms at the Friday meeting at the White House.\nDespite President Trump touting Venezuela\u2019s oil as a creator of \u201ctremendous wealth\u201d for industry and \u201cgreat wealth\u201d for the American people, the reception from executives was lukewarm.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we\u2019ve historically seen here,\u201d Exxon\u2019s CEO Darren Woods told President Trump.\n\u201cIf we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it\u2019s uninvestable.\u201d\nRegardless of how investable Venezuela will be in the future, the U.S. control over its oil industry would change the power balance in the oil markets, giving the U.S. more sway in longer-term supply. This would leave OPEC and the wider OPEC+ group including Russia and Kazakhstan with potentially diminished clout in influencing the oil market balances and prices."

Reuters reported on Sunday that the US Justice Department is investigating Fed\u2019s Powell for possible criminal issues related to his June Senate testimony on the Fed\u2019s building renovations.

ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said last week that interest rates are at an appropriate level, though he warned of \u201cenormous uncertainty\u201d due to geopolitical risks.\nFinancial markets currently see limited scope for immediate action, with a chance of rates remaining unchanged at the next meeting. Some analysts expect a rate reduction later in 2026, though a hike is considered unlikely given the subdued inflation backdrop.\nThe US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for December will be in the spotlight later on Tuesday. The headline and core CPI are projected to see a rise of 2.7% YoY in December. If the report shows a hotter-than-expected outcome, this could help limit the Greenback\u2019s losses in the near term.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro.

                "body": "EUR/USD forecast: Currency pair of the week | Monday 12 January 2026\nThe dollar fell against the euro and indeed almost all other major currencies today (except the yen) on the back of a surprise announcement that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That development immediately raised concerns around the Fed\u2019s independence, prompting investors to sell US assets broadly and rotate into traditional safe havens. But we saw US indices come back up, even as gold and silver continued to surge higher. The EUR/USD forecast remains neutral despite the rebound given the recent mildly bearish price action, and pockets of strength in US data. But If fears around Fed independence fade quickly, the EUR/USD may well resume lower, even if the downside looks to be quite limited. Atten will shift back towards incoming data with CPI and retail sales firmly in focus this week, following a mixed jobs report released on Friday of last week.\nAnnexation of Greenland major risk for EUR/USD forecast\nThe main downside risk to the euro and frankly nearly all other major European currencies is the growing risk from the US threat to forcibly annex Greenland. Data-wise, the euro has very little to work with this week. As well as the lack of any meaningful data, it is unlikely that any of the ECB speakers will say anything out of the ordinary. As a result, markets are unlikely to materially adjust ECB rate pricing.\nTherefore, if concerns over Fed independency quickly fades, there is scope for the EUR/USD to push towards 1.1600 in the near term, possibly 1.1500, as the dollar makes a potential recovery.\nFocus turns to US CPI release\nMeanwhile, the US economic calendar is also not super busy this week, but we do have a couple of important macro pointers scheduled. Following Friday\u2019s mixed US non-farm payrolls report, consumer inflation data is expected to land on Tuesday with a headline reading of 2.7% year-on-year, unchanged from the previous month. On a month over month bases, both headline and core CPI measures are expected to print +0.3% respectively.\nOne other potentially market moving event that investors will need to be watching is the Supreme Court ruling on Trump\u2019s tariffs. A potentially unfavourable ruling could emerge at some point this week and may lend further support to the dollar.\nFor now, though, those factors feel secondary. Investors are likely to demand greater clarity on the Fed situation before rebuilding meaningful dollar long positions. A much weaker inflation print combined with lingering doubts over Fed independence could instead trigger a dollar slide, potentially lifting the EUR/USD forecast, particularly if there is also a technical break out from the bearish channel.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.3475 region, up nearly 0.10% for the day.\nThe US Dollar (USD) struggles to attract any meaningful buyers amid growing worries about the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) independence, and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair. In fact, prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. In a rare statement, Powell said that the threat of criminal charges against him is a consequence of the central bank setting interest rates based on the best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\nDespite the negative development, the downside for the USD remains limited amid reduced bets for more aggressive policy easing by the Fed, which, in turn, could cap gains for the GBP/USD pair. A fall in the US Unemployment Rate, to a larger extent, overshadowed a miss in the headline US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) figures and backed the case for potentially stagnant monetary policy in the first quarter. This, in turn, holds back the USD bears from placing aggressive bets as the focus shifts to the latest US consumer inflation figures, due later today.\nIn the meantime, rising bets for two more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) in 2026 could act as a headwind for the British Pound (GBP) and also keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the GBP/USD pair. Traders this week will also confront the release of the US Producer Price Index on Wednesday. Apart from this, the monthly UK GDP report on Thursday would provide some meaningful impetus to the currency pair.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data rele"

He explicitly stated that these threats are a punishment because the Fed refused to follow President Trump's demands to lower interest rates, choosing instead to make decisions based on what is best for the public.\nWhile President Trump denies knowing anything about the investigation, he has a long history of attacking Powell for not cutting rates as quickly as he wants.\nThis move has brought Fed independence fears to the forefront once more.

Investors are feeling calmer about the American job market after the unemployment rate dropped to 4.4% on Friday, even though the underlying details aren't entirely positive.\nFinally, the dollar was expected to get a boost from the US Supreme Court, which is likely to rule against President Trump's tariffs sometime between Tuesday and Thursday.

After rebounding from a three-week low near 1.3390, the pair is now trading close to 1.3475, reflecting a modest increase of about 0.10% for the session.\nThe US Dollar is struggling to find strong support as concerns mount over the independence of the Federal Reserve. This uncertainty has provided a boost to the GBP/USD pair. Notably, prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Powell responded by emphasizing that any legal threats stem from the central bank\u2019s commitment to setting interest rates based on what is best for the public, rather than aligning with presidential preferences.\nDespite these developments, the US Dollar\u2019s losses remain contained, as expectations for aggressive policy easing by the Federal Reserve have diminished. A recent drop in the US Unemployment Rate has largely offset weaker-than-expected Nonfarm Payrolls data, supporting the view that monetary policy may remain steady in the near term. As a result, traders are cautious about making strong bearish bets on the Dollar, with attention now turning to the upcoming US consumer inflation report.\nMeanwhile, speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) could implement two additional rate cuts in 2026 may weigh on the British Pound and limit further advances for the GBP/USD pair. This week, investors are also awaiting the release of the US Producer Price Index on Wednesday, as well as the UK\u2019s monthly GDP figures on Thursday, both of which are expected to influence the currency pair\u2019s direction."

                "body": "Australian dollar outlook: AUD/USD rips as Fed fears ease and spending jumps\n- Fed served DOJ subpoenas, sparking fears of political interference\n- Republican resistance reduces risk of Trump stacking the FOMC\n- Aussie boosted by robust household spending and rate hike prospects\nSummary\nMarkets started the week on edge after Jerome Powell revealed the Fed had been served DOJ subpoenas, raising concerns about political interference in monetary policy. Those fears eased as Republican senators vowed to block Trump\u2019s Fed nominees, reinforcing confidence that independence will hold. Risk appetite recovered, with the Australian dollar outperforming thanks to strong domestic spending data that keeps the RBA on track for a possible February hike.\nFed Independence Fears Fade\nJerome Powell revealed over the weekend that the Fed had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice (DOJ), raising fears of political interference in monetary policy. While the official explanation points to testimony on renovations at the Fed\u2019s headquarters, the timing suggests pressure aimed at the central bank. For markets, that matters.\nWhy is this such a concern? If policy starts to look political rather than data-driven, you risk a second coming of the \u201csell America\u201d trade, similar to what followed Liberation Day in 2025. That would mean a weaker dollar as reserve confidence fades, higher long-end yields as term premiums widen, and risk assets generally under pressure as uncertainty grows.\nHowever, a pushback from Republican lawmakers in response to the subpoenas changed the tone in markets on Monday. Vows from Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski to block any Trump Fed nominees until the DOJ investigation is resolved build confidence that independence will hold. Without their support, Trump\u2019s pick for Fed chair is unlikely to be confirmed, making it far harder to stack the FOMC with policy doves aligned with his views, especially if Lisa Cook\u2019s dismissal is ruled illegal by the U.S. Supreme Court. That would reduce the odds of politically driven rate cuts or personnel changes that skew the committee\u2019s reaction function.\nThat likely explains today\u2019s price action. Risk appetite has recovered as traders reassess the political and policy implications, with high-beta currencies like the Australian dollar outperforming. Domestic factors have also helped, with strong household spending data reinforcing expectations that the RBA may need to tighten policy further, adding to the Aussie\u2019s appeal on interest rate differentials.\nSolid Spending Keeps RBA Hike Risk alive\nAustralian household spending surged again in November, rising 1% after an upwardly revised 1.4% gain in October. It marked the first back-to-back 1%+ monthly increases since late 2022 and saw the annual growth rate accelerate to 6.3%, the strongest since September 2023. Discretionary categories led the charge, supported by major events and Black Friday sales. With Q4 averaging 1.2% so far compared to just 0.3% in Q3, real household consumption looks set to deliver another solid contribution to GDP without a major unwind in December.\nThe strength in spending keeps the RBA on track to consider another rate hike as early as February, provided inflation trends in Q4 mirror those seen in Q3. Robust demand, particularly in discretionary segments, suggests underlying momentum in the largest sector in the economy remains firm. If price pressures persist alongside this level of consumption, the case for a further increase in the cash rate will be hard to ignore, likely underpinning the Australian dollar on a pure interest rate differential basis.\nAUD/USD Rangebound Following Bullish Move\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at AUD/USD on the daily chart, the pair looks to be settling into a new range following recent gains, attracting bids on moves towards support at .6660 with bullish probes running into offers layered above .6720.\nThat\u2019s the initial range traders should focus on, rather than the bullish s"

At the time of writing, AUD/USD trades around 0.6714, up nearly 0.35% on the day.\nThe US Dollar comes under renewed selling pressure after reports that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) issued grand jury subpoenas as part of a criminal investigation involving Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell, raising fresh concerns over political pressure on the central bank.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback's value against six major peers, is trading around 98.88 after retreating from one-month highs.\nPowell stood his ground, saying the action is politically motivated and that the Fed must continue to set policy based on economic conditions rather than political pressure.\nOn the monetary policy front, growing policy divergence between the Fed and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) keeps AUD/USD tilted to the upside.\nThe Fed remains on a gradual easing path after last week\u2019s mixed US labour-market data trimmed expectations for a near-term rate cut, although traders continue to expect a total of around 50 basis points (bps) of easing this year.\nLooking ahead, traders will closely watch the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on Tuesday for further clues on the Fed\u2019s policy outlook, while also parsing remarks from key Fed officials throughout the week.\nIn Australia, markets are increasingly anticipating that the RBA\u2019s next move could be a rate hike, as the latest inflation data show price pressure remains above the central bank\u2019s 2-3% target band.\nIn a recent interview with ABC News, RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said it was \u201cstill true\u201d that Australians had likely seen the last rate cuts this cycle. Meanwhile, an Australian Financial Review survey showed that 17 of 38 economists now expect at least two rate hikes over the next 18 months.\nOn the data front, the Australian economic calendar remains relatively light this week, with Westpac Consumer Confidence scheduled for Tuesday and Consumer Inflation Expectations due on Thursday. Markets will also track China\u2019s trade data on Wednesday, as developments in exports and imports often influence the Aussie due to Australia\u2019s close economic ties with China.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chi"

Reports of a Department of Justice probe involving Fed Chair Powell have led to broader US Dollar selling pressures, affecting its value across global markets.\nCurrently, AUD/USD is trading around 0.6714, up by nearly 0.35%. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the Greenback against six major currencies, has decreased to approximately 98.88. The ongoing policy gap between the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia aids the AUD, with expectations of potential Australian rate hikes strengthening the Aussie further.\nFederal Reserve And RBA Policies\nThe Federal Reserve remains cautious, with mixed US labour data affecting expectations for rate adjustments. Around 50 basis points of easing are expected this year, but speculations on upcoming rate changes continue. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s monetary policy sentiment suggests a potential rate hike due to inflation concerns.\nThe outcome of the US Consumer Price Index data, to be released soon, will be pivotal for the Fed\u2019s policy directions. Economic indicators for Australia, like Westpac Consumer Confidence, are expected shortly, while China\u2019s trade data will also be monitored. The broader economic interplay between Australia and China remains significant for the AUD\u2019s trajectory.\nLooking back at the situation in 2025, concerns over Fed independence created temporary US dollar weakness, but that has since faded from focus. As of today, January 13, 2026, the primary driver is the clear policy divergence between the central banks. We are now navigating an environment where the AUD/USD is holding firm around 0.6850, testing its recent highs.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s expected easing path in 2025 did not fully materialize, as sticky inflation persisted through the second half of the year. The most recent US CPI data for December 2025 came in at 3.4%, prompting the Fed to signal a firm pause on any further rate cuts in the first quarter of this year. This has provided underlying support for the US dollar, capping gains in the Aussie.\nAussie Dollar Support\nConversely, the Reserve Bank of Australia met the hawkish expectations from last year, delivering a final rate hike in November 2025. However, with the latest quarterly inflation figures from late 2025 showing a modest cool-down to 3.8%, the market now believes the RBA\u2019s tightening cycle is complete. This leaves the policy rate differential between the two nations less favorable for the AUD than we anticipated six months ago.\nSupporting the Australian dollar are external factors, particularly strong commodity prices and steady demand from China. Iron ore prices have remained robust, trading above $140 per tonne for the last two months, well above the 2025 average. China\u2019s latest trade balance figures, released just last week, showed a surprising 2.5% increase in imports, easing fears of a slowdown.\nGiven these conflicting forces, we expect elevated volatility in the AUD/USD pair in the coming weeks. The Fed\u2019s surprisingly firm stance creates downside risk, while strong commodity prices provide a solid floor for the currency. Derivative traders should consider strategies that benefit from sharp price swings, such as purchasing straddles, rather than taking an outright directional view on the pair."

I'm eyeing January 19 for direct intervention risk\nThe continued surge in USD/JPY despite multiple rounds of official jawboning has refocused my attention on the risk of direct yen intervention, even as authorities show little urgency to escalate beyond rhetoric for now.\nJapanese officials have already stepped up verbal warnings, with Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama flagging concerns about one-sided yen weakness during talks in Washington, followed by reinforced language from the government spokesperson warning against sharp and speculative FX moves. Yet the impact on pricing has so far been limited, with USD/JPY continuing to grind higher.\nMarkets appear to be interpreting the lack of follow-through as a signal that tolerance for yen weakness remains relatively high, particularly while Japanese equities benefit. The Nikkei 225 has pushed to record highs, underpinned by the weak currency\u2019s boost to exporters\u2019 overseas earnings, complicating the political calculus around intervention.\nThat said, traders are increasingly alert to the conditions under which Tokyo has historically chosen to act. Japan has tended to intervene when FX moves become disorderly rather than merely directional, often during periods of thinner liquidity when impact per dollar spent is maximised. Against that backdrop, upcoming U.S. market holidays later this month have emerged as potential risk windows rather than base-case triggers.\nSpecifically January 19, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day:\n- Equity markets are closed\n- US bond markets are closed\n- FX never fully closes but liquidity and interest will be much thinner than usual\nImportantly, officials have stopped short of defining explicit red lines. Rate differentials continue to favour the dollar, and without a shift in Bank of Japan policy, any intervention would still be leaning against fundamentals \u2014 a dynamic Tokyo is well aware tends to limit durability.\nFor now, markets are testing Japan\u2019s tolerance rather than pricing imminent action. But as USD/JPY pushes into fresh highs and verbal intervention loses traction, sensitivity to sharp or illiquid moves is rising. The longer yen weakness persists without consolidation, the greater the risk that authorities feel compelled to act \u2014 not on a schedule, but in response to market behaviour."

Reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may soon call a snap election to take advantage of strong approval ratings fueled speculation for more expansionary fiscal policy. Adding to this, the uncertainty over the likely timing of the next interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the deepening Japan\u2013China diplomatic crisis, and a positive risk tone continue to undermine the safe-haven JPY.\nMeanwhile, the recent JPY decline might prompt some verbal intervention from Japanese authorities, which, in turn, warrants some caution for bearish traders. The USD, on the other hand, seems to struggle to attract meaningful buyers amid concerns about the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) independence, and also keep a lid on the USD/JPY pair. Investors might also opt to wait for the release of the US consumer inflation figures, due later today, for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and determining the trajectory for the currency pair.\nJapanese Yen continues to be pressured by political risks, BoJ rate hike doubts\n- Reports suggest that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call an early election in the first half of February to bolster her coalition government\u2019s parliamentary majority, fueling hopes for additional stimulus.\n- Last week, China prohibited some rare earth elements from being exported to Japan with immediate effect. The ban follows a diplomatic row over Taiwan and heightens supply-chain risk for Japanese manufacturers.\n- Despite the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook, investors remain uncertain about the likely timing of the next rate hike. This, along with the risk-on impulse, is seen undermining demand for the safe-haven Japanese Yen.\n- Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said this Tuesday that she shared concerns over the JPY's recent one-sided decline with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and added that the tolerance for weakness was limited.\n- Concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence resurfaced on Monday after prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against Jerome Powell over his testimony about the central bank building renovation project.\n- Powell, in a rate statement, called the probe unprecedented and said that he believed it was opened due to US President Donald Trump's anger over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates despite repeated public pressure.\n- This keeps the US Dollar bulls on the defensive despite firming expectations for a less aggressive monetary policy easing by the US central bank this year, bolstered by the latest monthly employment details released last Friday.\n- Traders are pricing in the possibility of two more rate cuts by the Fed in 2026. This marks a significant divergence compared to expectations that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path and should cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated last week that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if economic and price developments move in line with forecasts, leaving the door open for further policy tightening.\n- Investors might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path.

                "body": "The Japanese Yen (JPY) experienced a slight recovery after reaching a one-year low against a weakening US Dollar (USD) during Monday\u2019s Asian session. Geopolitical tensions have bolstered safe-haven flows towards the JPY, while concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence apply pressure on the USD. Subsequently, the USD/JPY pair saw some limitations in its movement.\nJapan faces uncertainties due to its rift with China and potential early elections, affecting JPY bets. This uncertainty is compounded by unclear timing on the Bank of Japan\u2019s next interest rate hike. Additionally, US inflation figures due this week could influence the USD/JPY pairing further. Tensions in Iran and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict enhance the appeal of the safe-haven Yen, though various elements curb enthusiasm among JPY traders.\nUS And Japan Economic Indicators\nEconomic data indicates US Nonfarm Payrolls rose by 50K in December, yet unemployment decreased to 4.4%. This influenced expectations of a Fed rate cut, contrasting with potential BoJ tightening. The BoJ sustains a prudent stance, with its gradual shift from ultra-loose policies supporting the Yen. Technical indicators like the 200-period SMA and MACD suggest an upward trend in the USD/JPY pair, though an overbought RSI could limit gains.\nOverall, the JPY\u2019s value is swayed by Japan\u2019s economic performance, BoJ policies, and global risk sentiment. As tensions and policy dynamics evolve, the Yen\u2019s perceived reliability continues to attract safe-haven investments, impacting its exchange rate against the US Dollar.\nLooking back at the analysis from early 2025, the market was navigating a complex mix of geopolitical risk and central bank uncertainty. The push and pull between safe-haven flows into the Yen and questions over the Bank of Japan\u2019s next move created significant tension. That environment saw USD/JPY testing the high 157.00s, a level that proved to be a peak as monetary policy divergence began to narrow.\nThat expected narrowing of policy did unfold throughout 2025, which helps explain our current situation. We saw the Federal Reserve implement three separate 25-basis-point rate cuts during the year, bringing the Fed Funds Rate down to its current 4.00-4.25% range. In contrast, the Bank of Japan delivered two cautious rate hikes, moving its policy rate to 0.25% by the end of last year and effectively ending its negative interest rate policy.\nCurrent Market Dynamics\nThis policy shift has brought the USD/JPY pair down to the 145.00 level we see today. However, recent U.S. data now complicates the outlook for further Fed easing. The December 2025 jobs report showed a resilient gain of 185,000 payrolls, and the latest CPI reading still shows inflation stubbornly holding at 3.1%, keeping pressure on the Fed to hold rates steady for now.\nOn the other side, Japan\u2019s own economic picture suggests the Bank of Japan may also be on hold for the near future. While core inflation is stable at 2.3%, recent GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2025 showed growth slowing to an annualized rate of just 0.4%. This tepid growth makes further aggressive rate hikes unlikely, capping the Yen\u2019s potential strength for the moment.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests the strong downward trend in USD/JPY seen last year may be losing momentum. The conflicting economic signals from both the U.S. and Japan point towards a period of consolidation or heightened volatility rather than a clear directional move. Therefore, using options to construct long volatility strategies, such as buying straddles or strangles, could be an effective approach in the coming weeks.\nThese strategies would profit from a significant price move in either direction, which could be triggered by upcoming inflation data or central bank communications. Implied volatility in USD/JPY options has fallen from its 2025 highs, making such positions relatively cheaper to establish now. The key is to position for a potential breakout from the curr"

The pair depreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from higher Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price gains ground for the fourth successive session, trading around $59.40 at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices gain traction amid supply concerns, which could be attributed to rising tensions in Iran. Traders brace for the release of the American Petroleum Institute (API) crude oil stockpiles report later in the day.\nUS President Donald Trump, on Monday, warned countries trading with Iran would face a 25% tariff on business with the United States, following threats of repercussions over civilian targeting, as Tehran cautioned the US and Israel against intervention, per Reuters.\nThe downside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) rebounds after registering modest losses in the previous session. Traders await the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December due on Tuesday, which could offer clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy path.\nMarkets are pricing in two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, starting in June, though an upside inflation surprise could curb easing prospects. December\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) missed expectations, reinforcing a more dovish Fed outlook. The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows that Fed funds futures price in about 95% probability that the US central bank will keep rates unchanged at its January 27\u201328 meeting.\nThe US Dollar weakened after federal prosecutors threatened to indict Fed Chair Jerome Powell over his congressional testimony on a building renovation, raising concerns over the Fed\u2019s independence. Investors are also awaiting a US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies, expected on Wednesday.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for "

                "body": "The US Dollar has experienced broad declines, pressured by renewed doubts regarding the Federal Reserve's autonomy. Despite this, the USD/CAD pair has seen only modest downward movement, with support holding above 1.3860, preserving the upward momentum established since December.\nFresh anxiety was sparked by a New York Times article revealing that the US Government has launched a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This development has reignited fears about the central bank\u2019s ability to operate without political interference, causing the Dollar to slip against major currencies during Monday\u2019s Asian trading hours.\nJerome Powell addressed these concerns in a video statement released soon after the news broke, describing the government\u2019s actions as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He suggested that these moves are part of a larger effort by US officials to pressure the central bank into reducing borrowing costs.\nThe Canadian Dollar\u2019s recovery has also been hampered by a slight decline in oil prices. US benchmark WTI crude fell by approximately $1, settling at $58.60 after reaching $59.60 earlier in the session. While oil, Canada\u2019s primary export, has gained about 2% since the start of the year, prices remain 23% below their June 2025 highs.\nOn the economic front, recent US data was generally upbeat. The unemployment rate dropped more than anticipated, and the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed improvement, reducing immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\nIn contrast, Canada\u2019s employment figures for December were mixed. The economy added 8,200 jobs, defying forecasts of a 5,000 job loss. However, the unemployment rate climbed to 6.8% from 6.5%, exceeding expectations of a smaller increase to 6.6%."

Concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence amid reduced rate cut bets contribute to this decline.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks on the consequences of criminal charges connected to interest rate decisions raise issues about the Fed\u2019s autonomy. Meanwhile, US geopolitical tensions and potential military action considerations by President Trump keep global risks heightened, partially cushioning the USD.\nImpact On The Canadian Dollar\nCrude Oil price pullbacks may undermine the CAD, which, coupled with weakening Canadian labour market reports, limit expectations for a tighter Bank of Canada policy. Conversely, stronger US Nonfarm Payrolls and a lower Unemployment Rate in December bolster the case for the Fed to maintain higher rates, potentially limiting USD losses.\nTraders remain cautious, anticipating the upcoming US CPI and PPI figures before making significant moves in the USD/CAD pair. The Federal Reserve\u2019s core functions include interest rate adjustments to manage inflation and employment, influencing the value of the USD. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT) are key tools impacting the USD, with QE typically leading to a weaker dollar and QT bolstering its strength.\nLooking back to early 2025, we saw the USD/CAD pair react sharply to concerns over Federal Reserve independence, which created significant two-way volatility around the 1.3900 level. Today, on January 12, 2026, those same political themes are echoing, but the economic landscape has shifted considerably, with the pair currently trading near 1.3750. This creates a new set of challenges and opportunities for navigating the coming weeks.\nGeopolitical And Economic Factors\nThe political pressure on the Fed has not subsided, adding a layer of unpredictable risk to holding long US Dollar positions. However, the core economic divergence between the US and Canada is now more pronounced than it was a year ago. Recent US jobs data from December 2025 showed a notable slowdown, with non-farm payrolls adding only 95,000 jobs, but inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target at 3.4%.\nOn the Canadian side, the Bank of Canada is facing mounting pressure as last week\u2019s domestic CPI figure came in at 2.1%, right near their target. This data, combined with a recent uptick in the Canadian unemployment rate to 6.3%, strengthens the case for the BoC to begin an easing cycle well ahead of the Fed. Historically, such monetary policy divergence has consistently led to a stronger USD/CAD.\nCrude oil prices, a key driver for the loonie, remain volatile but have found a floor, with WTI trading consistently in the $85-$90 range due to persistent geopolitical risk. While this provides some underlying support for the Canadian dollar, it is not enough to counteract the growing monetary policy gap we see forming with the United States. This situation mirrors periods we saw in the mid-2010s when oil prices stabilized but a hawkish Fed still propelled USD/CAD higher.\nGiven the potential for sudden USD weakness from political headlines, an outright long spot position carries significant risk. Therefore, we see traders increasingly favoring derivative strategies to express a bullish view on USD/CAD. Buying call options with a strike price around 1.4000 for the March 2026 expiry offers a way to profit from the expected policy divergence while defining and limiting downside risk."

Spot prices have climbed to a fresh high since August 2008, with bulls now looking to extend the ascending trend further beyond the 214.00 mark amid a broadly weaker Japanese Yen (JPY).\nReports that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may soon call a snap election to take advantage of her approval ratings fuel speculations about further expansionary fiscal policy. This comes on top of the uncertainty over the likely timing of the next rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the deepening Japan\u2013China diplomatic crisis, which, in turn, is seen weighing heavily on the JPY. Moreover, the underlying bullish sentiment across the global equity markets turns out to be another factor undermining the JPY's safe-haven status and pushing the GBP/JPY cross higher.\nThe JPY bears, meanwhile, seem unaffected by expectations that Japanese authorities could step in to stem further weakness in the domestic currency. In fact, Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said this Tuesday that she shared concerns over the JPY's recent one-sided slide with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and added that the tolerance for weakness was limited. Moreover, the BoJ's hawkish outlook also does little to ease the prevalent selling bias surrounding the JPY, which backs the case for a further near-term appreciating move for the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, benefits from the lack of any meaningful US Dollar (USD) buying interest. This, in turn, validates the near-term positive outlook on the back of the overnight strength beyond the previous multi-year peak, around the 212.15 region, touched last week. From a technical perspective, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing overbought conditions and warrants caution for the GBP/JPY bulls. Traders now look to Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey's speech for a fresh impetus amid bets for two more interest rate cuts in 2026.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY has reached new highs near 212.50, buoyed by a weakening Yen. This follows reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may be planning snap elections in February, creating unexpected political uncertainty and pressuring the Yen.\nReports suggest Takaichi may dissolve the House of Representatives on January 23, with elections on February 8 or 15. This development surprised markets, impacting the Yen significantly.\nCurrent Market Trend\nThe GBP/JPY is trading at 212.29 within an upward channel since early November. Technical indicators, such as the 4-Hour RSI at 66 and a positive MACD, indicate a bullish trend with potential targets at 212.85 and 213.34 if gains consolidate above 212.10.\nHowever, a downside risk exists if the price dips below the 210 mark, with trendline resistance at 211.20 and further support from late-December lows between 210.05 and 210.25.\nToday\u2019s heat map shows JPY experiencing a 0.08% change against the USD, with varied movements against other major currencies. The base and quote currencies help determine percentage changes, highlighting the Yen\u2019s performance throughout various currency pairs.\nLooking back at the analysis from early 2025, we can see the market was focused on Japanese political uncertainty pushing GBP/JPY to long-term highs. That dynamic, driven by rumors of a snap election, has completely changed a year later. The fundamental drivers for the yen are now monetary policy based, not political.\nMonetary Policies and Market Strategies\nThe major shift has been the Bank of Japan\u2019s exit from its negative interest rate policy in the fourth quarter of 2025. With Japan\u2019s core inflation now holding above 2% for the last six months, the market is pricing in the possibility of another small rate hike this year. This provides a fundamental bid for the yen that was absent throughout early 2025.\nOn the sterling side, the Bank of England is still battling persistent price pressures, with the latest December inflation data showing a headline rate of 3.1%. This is well above the BoE\u2019s target, suggesting interest rates in the UK will remain elevated for longer, lending support to the pound. We are now in a tug-of-war between two central banks with tightening biases.\nFor derivative traders, this environment points towards increased volatility rather than the clear uptrend we saw this time last year. We believe purchasing straddles is a viable strategy, as it allows for profiting from a large price swing in either direction without betting on a specific outcome. This is preferable to taking an outright directional view in such a conflicted macro environment.\nHistorically, the initial phases of a Bank of Japan tightening cycle, like the one seen in 2006, often lead to choppy, whipsaw price action in yen crosses. The pair is no longer simply a \u201crisk-on\u201d trade based on yen weakness. Therefore, we should use options to position for a period of price discovery and two-way volatility in the coming weeks."

                "body": "The Wall Street Bitcoin ETF takeover has crossed a defining threshold. What began as cautious experimentation has turned into coordinated institutional dominance, with Morgan Stanley joining BlackRock and Fidelity in a Bitcoin ETF market now worth over $123 billion. This reflects the alignment of regulation, client demand, and competitive pressure pulling Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) squarely into traditional finance.\nCryptocurrency exposure is becoming standard as large banks and asset managers integrate ETFs into advisory products and retirement plans. The outcome is a Bitcoin ETF market that\u2019s shaped by institutional flows and long-term allocations rather than speculative momentum.\nWall Street\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Market Hits $123 Billion\u2014How We Got Here\nThe Bitcoin ETF story represents one of the fastest institutional adoption cycles in financial history. Decades of SEC denial ended in January 2024 when court decisions compelled the agency to greenlight eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, eliminating longstanding custody and regulatory concerns.\nInstitutional capital responded immediately. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $35.2 billion in cumulative net inflows in 2024, and the total net assets now stand at $123.52 billion. The first week of 2026 alone brought over $1.2 billion in fresh capital. This regulatory clarity and the availability of regulated structures enabled pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers to invest with confidence, transforming Bitcoin from a speculative asset into an acknowledged commodity exposure.\nThe Wall Street Bitcoin ETF takeover marks a structural shift. Investor confidence grew from regulatory approval and operational readiness, proving that traditional finance could interact with crypto assets safely. Both spot and futures ETFs now form the foundation of institutional crypto involvement.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Entry Marks Next Phase of Institutional Crypto Adoption\nThe Morgan Stanley crypto ETF entry on January 6 represents the most significant bank-led Wall Street\u2019s expansion yet. Morgan Stanley filed S-1 registration statements with the SEC for spot Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, becoming the first major U.S. bank to seek approval for its own spot Bitcoin ETF.\nBy integrating a proprietary Bitcoin ETF into E*Trade and wealth management platforms, Morgan Stanley retains control over client relationships, fee structures, and portfolio recommendations. The bank\u2019s strategy embeds crypto exposure directly into retirement accounts and balanced portfolios, enhancing accessibility for both high-net-worth and mainstream clients.\nBank of America followed suit, allowing wealth advisers to recommend crypto allocations from January 2026. According to the SEC filing, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust will track Bitcoin\u2019s spot price without leverage or derivatives. The firm also plans crypto trading on E*Trade in H1 2026.\nThe filing reflects broader institutional crypto adoption patterns\u2014showing that even late entrants can secure competitive advantages through brand trust, distribution reach, and strategic product integration.\nHow BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley Are Reshaping Crypto Markets\nInstitutional influence is redefining Bitcoin\u2019s market structure. BlackRock, Fidelity, and now Morgan Stanley control significant capital flows, creating structural demand that supports price stability and reduces volatility over time.\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds approximately $70.6 billion in assets, making it the most dominant player in the space. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC adds $17.7 billion in AUM with roughly 203,000 BTC in custody. These allocations move beyond simple hedging, acting as directional capital that reinforces market trends during rallies and corrections.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s entry adds proprietary distribution, embedding ETFs directly into advisory workflows. Combined, these firms set liquidity and price discovery standards for the entire Bitcoin ETF market in 2026. Their dominance ensures institutional-grade execution, reliabl"

That\u2019s not my focus,\u201d Atkins said, underscoring that the SEC is not currently prioritizing asset confiscation.\nRumors in crypto and intelligence circles have pointed to a massive \u201cshadow reserve\u201d of Bitcoin allegedly accumulated by the Venezuelan government through gold sales, oil deals settled in stablecoins, and other transactions dating back to 2018.\nIf verified and under U.S. control, such a reserve would rank among the largest Bitcoin holdings globally.\nBut independent blockchain analysts note that there is no verifiable on\u2011chain evidence yet linking wallets containing such amounts to Venezuela\u2019s government, and publicly traceable addresses connected to state entities reflect only a tiny fraction of the rumored holdings.\nBitcoin and CLARITY Act update\nAtkins pivoted quickly from the Venezuela question to highlight ongoing legislative efforts in Congress aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework for digital assets.\n\u201cThis week is an important week because the Senate is taking up a bipartisan bill that will bring clarity and certainty to the crypto world,\u201d he said, referring to a measure designed to delineate oversight responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nThe bill \u2014 backed by members of both parties and anticipated to be marked up this week \u2014 represents the next step in positioning the U.S. as a global leader in digital asset markets, Atkins said.\nHe also cited the Genius Act, passed late last year, as the first statute formally recognizing crypto assets under U.S. law, and credited it with helping to bring regulatory clarity to stablecoin frameworks.\nAtkins expressed optimism that with clearer rules, markets will gain much\u2011needed certainty around products and oversight.\nHe noted ongoing collaboration with the new CFTC chairman and reiterated the SEC\u2019s commitment to enforcing future regulations once enacted.\nWhile ethical questions around public officials and crypto business interests remain under Congressional purview, Atkins said the immediate priority is a regulatory regime that reduces market ambiguity and supports investor confidence."

                "body": "Standard Chartered says '2026 will be the year of Ethereum' as bank backs ETH outperformance\nQuick Take\n- Standard Chartered said \u201c2026 will be the year of Ethereum,\u201d citing improving relative fundamentals even as weaker Bitcoin performance has weighed on the broader digital asset market.\n- The bank argued that Ethereum\u2019s dominance in stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets, and DeFi, alongside rising network throughput, should help ETH outperform BTC.\n- Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, also lowered his price forecasts for 2026 to 2028 while raising longer-term targets.\nStandard Chartered has struck a bullish tone on Ethereum\u2019s outlook, with the bank\u2019s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, saying he expects Ethereum to outperform crypto peers in 2026 even as the firm trims some near-term price forecasts amid broader weakness in crypto markets.\n\u201cI think 2026 will be the year of Ethereum, much like 2021 was,\u201d Kendrick said in a note accompanying the bank\u2019s latest digital assets report. He pointed to the growing adoption of blockchains and onchain products as factors that should allow ether to \u201coutperform significantly.\u201d\nThe call comes as Standard Chartered has turned more constructive on Ethereum versus Bitcoin, despite lowering its absolute ETH price targets for the next few years. It now sees ether ending 2026 at $7,500, down from a previous $12,000 estimate, followed by $15,000 in 2027 and $22,000 in 2028, both lower than earlier projections. In contrast, Standard Chartered has raised its longer-dated outlook, lifting its end-2029 forecast to $30,000 and introducing a new $40,000 target for end-2030.\nETH\u2019s bull case\nIn the report, the bank said weaker-than-expected Bitcoin performance has dampened prospects for digital assets against the dollar, given the foremost cryptocurrency\u2019s continued dominance of the sector. Relative to Bitcoin, however, Ethereum\u2019s drivers have strengthened, Kendrick asserted.\nStandard Chartered now expects the ETH-BTC ratio to gradually return toward its 2021 highs, around 0.08, as Ethereum benefits from structural advantages not shared by its peers. Those include its dominant position in stablecoins, real-world assets, and decentralized finance, as well as ongoing efforts to scale the network.\nKendrick\u2019s team said flows into digital asset exchange-traded funds and corporate treasury vehicles have slowed across the board, but remain relatively more supportive for Ethereum than for Bitcoin. The report highlighted continued buying by BitMine Immersion, currently the largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury company, which now holds about 3.4% of ether in circulation and remains on track to reach its 5% target.\nStandard Chartered also reiterated its bullish stance on stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, forecasting both markets to reach $2 trillion by 2028, with the majority of activity expected to settle on Ethereum. According to the bank, more than half of all stablecoins and tokenized RWAs already sit on Ethereum, a share it expects to grow as traditional financial activity moves onchain.\nNetwork fundamentals were another pillar of the thesis. Ethereum\u2019s transaction count has reached fresh all-time highs in recent weeks, driven largely by stablecoin activity, which now accounts for roughly 35% to 40% of transactions.\nThe bank said planned increases in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 throughput \u2014 including steps taken through the Fusaka upgrade in December \u2014 are critical, as higher throughput has historically translated into a higher market capitalization.\nAs The Block previously reported, Ethereum developers deployed two major hard forks last year in Pectra and Fusaka. The successful rollout began a twice-a-year upgrade schedule designed to scale Ethereum\u2019s network into a trillion-dollar ecosystem.\nStandard Chartered also added that a more supportive regulatory backdrop could further bolster the outlook, pointing to the proposed U.S. Clarity Act, which "

He also believes that ETH\u2019s growth this year will outperform Bitcoin, driven by improving relative fundamentals in the market.\nThe bank\u2019s Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, stated that the prospects for Ethereum in 2026 have significantly improved. He also anticipates that the digital asset will cross and gradually return to its 2021 highs.\nKendrick cites crypto regulation as a catalyst for ETH\u2019s rally in 2026\nLove this take from @vaneck_us on ethererum $ETH\n\u2013 by 2030, base case $ETH -> $22,000\n\u2013 by 2030, bull case $ETH -> $154,000https://t.co/hCjsZNL61A pic.twitter.com/C10yq3QRfX\u2014 Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) January 9, 2026\nKendrick pointed to weaker-than-expected BTC performance weighing on the broader cryptocurrency industry as evidence for ETH\u2019s potential rally. He also argued that continued purchases by the largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury company will push ETH higher this year.\nThe analyst forecasted that Ethereum will surge, driven by its dominance in stablecoins. He also pointed to the progress in plans to increase the digital asset\u2019s Layer-1 throughput by tenfold.\nStandard Chartered\u2019s analyst also believes that regulations surrounding the crypto industry are a potential catalyst to catapult ETH\u2019s price. He pointed to the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees\u2019 vote on the CLARITY Act legislation expected on Thursday.\nKendrick acknowledged that the passage of the bill will establish a clearer framework for virtual assets. He also believes the legislation could significantly benefit Ethereum by unlocking further DeFi developments. Standard Chartered revealed that it lowered its ETH-USD forecast for 2026-2028 due to the weakness in Bitcoin prices.\n\u201cDespite our more positive outlook for ETH versus BTC, we lower our ETH-USD forecast for 2026-2028 due to BTC weakness. However, we raise our ETH-USD forecast for end-2029, and we see the price reaching $40,000 by end-2030.\u201d\n-Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered.\nFor the near term, Kendrick predicts that Ethereum\u2019s price will reach $7,500 in 2026, which would be a new all-time high for the digital asset. The analyst had previously forecasted that ETH would hit $12,000 this year. For its longer-term outlook, Standard Chartered predicts that ETH prices will reach $30,000 by 2029 and $40,000 by 2030.\nKendrick\u2019s forecast suggests that Ethereum would have to surge by nearly 1,200% from current prices to hit its $40,000 target. At the time of publication, Ethereum is trading at $3,099, down nearly 1.45% in the past 24 hours. The digital asset has also declined by more than 1.7% over the past 30 days.\nBitmine adds more ETH to its balance sheet\nStandard Chartered\u2019s forecast on ETH comes as the leading publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, continues accumulating the digital asset. The firm purchased an additional 24,266 ETH over the last week, worth around $76 million.\nBitmine\u2019s latest acquisition has increased its ETH portfolio to over 4.16 million ETH, valued at more than $13 billion. The firm now ranks as the largest Ethereum treasury company and also the second-largest digital asset treasury behind Strategy.\nBitmine\u2019s ETH stockpile accounts for about 3.5% of the entire Ethereum circulating supply. The firm\u2019s Chairman, Tom Lee, argued that many positive things favor Ethereum in 2026. He pointed to the adoption of stablecoins and tokenization, saying both will make the ETH blockchain the settlement layer of Wall Street.\nLee also stated that 2026 is the year crypto prices will recover, calling the October 10 record-setting liquidation a mini-crypto winter. He also believes ETH will record stronger gains in 2027-2028.\nLee predicted on January 2 that Ethereum could reach $250,000, a more than 7,800% surge from the current prices.

                "body": "The landscape of institutional digital asset investment shifted permanently throughout 2025, and as of January 12, 2026, the ripple effects of Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) expanding into Solana futures are more visible than ever. What began as a strategic filing with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in early 2025 has matured into a cornerstone of the Solana ecosystem, providing the regulatory certainty and liquidity required for the world\u2019s largest asset managers to move beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe launch of these regulated contracts on February 18, 2025, was met with immediate enthusiasm from the high-frequency trading community and hedge funds, who had long sought a U.S.-regulated venue to hedge SOL exposure. By mid-2025, Coinbase stepped further into the breach by introducing 24/7 trading for these futures, effectively bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) hours and the around-the-clock nature of the blockchain. This move has been a primary catalyst in cementing Solana\u2019s status as the third major institutional asset class in the crypto space.\nMarket Impact and Price Action\nThe introduction of CFTC-regulated futures has fundamentally altered Solana\u2019s (SOL) market structure. Throughout 2025, the \"basis trade\"\u2014whereby institutions go long on spot SOL and short the futures to capture yield\u2014became a dominant strategy. This resulted in a massive surge in liquidity, with Solana\u2019s total open interest across all regulated venues, including the CME and Coinbase, reaching a staggering $13 billion by August 2025. Currently, as of early January 2026, SOL is trading in a consolidation range between $125 and $145, maintaining a robust market capitalization of approximately $75.5 billion.\nWhile the price experienced a \"Red December\" in 2025, dropping roughly 12% amid broader macro-economic cooling, the presence of deep futures markets has provided a \"soft landing.\" Unlike the volatile swings of 2023 and 2024, the current market shows significantly higher support levels. Technical analysts are currently eyeing the $147 resistance mark; a clean break above this, supported by the ongoing \"Green January\" momentum, could signal a retest of all-time highs. The 24/7 trading availability on Coinbase has also reduced \"gap risk\" during weekend volatility, a factor that has historically deterred large-scale capital entry.\nCommunity and Ecosystem Response\nThe Solana community has largely embraced the \"institutionalization\" of the network. On social media platforms like X and Reddit, the narrative has shifted from SOL being a \"retail-only\" chain to a legitimate competitor to Ethereum for enterprise-grade applications. This sentiment is bolstered by the technical success of the Firedancer upgrade, which has recently pushed network speeds toward 1 million transactions per second (TPS) in testing environments.\nWithin the DeFi space, protocols like Jupiter and Kamino have seen record volumes as institutional players use regulated futures to hedge complex on-chain yield strategies. The growth of the Solana stablecoin market to $15 billion in January 2026 is a testament to this increased velocity of capital. Furthermore, the entry of traditional giants has brought a new level of legitimacy; for instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) recently filed for a Solana Trust ETF, a move that the community views as the ultimate validation of the network's resilience and regulatory \"thaw.\"\nWhat's Next for Crypto\nThe primary focus for the first half of 2026 is the potential approval of a Spot Solana ETF. Analysts currently estimate the odds of SEC approval at 80% to 90% by mid-year, citing the existence of a \"significant, regulated market\" for the underlying asset\u2014a requirement that Coinbase\u2019s futures market has now satisfied for over a year. If approved, the influx of capital from retail brokerage accounts could dwarf the institutional inflows seen in 2025.\nBeyond ETFs, we are witnessing the rise of the \"Productive Treasury.\" Mo"

Certain coins are emerging as strong contenders for growth, thanks to their innovative technology and real-world applications. Choosing the right crypto now could give investors a significant advantage as the year unfolds. In this article, we look at three cryptocurrencies that have shown remarkable potential. These projects are backed by fast, reliable networks, supportive developer communities, and unique financial tools.\nSolana (SOL)\nSolana has experienced a rollercoaster journey, moving from \u201cEthereum killer\u201d hype to doubts about its future. Despite challenges, Solana Network has proven resilient. Its fast transaction speeds and extremely low fees make it a favorite for consumer-focused applications, including NFT marketplaces and DePIN protocols. Solana has also introduced Firedancer.\nSolana Pay is gaining traction as a payment solution, and integration with Shopify opens doors for real-world retail use. Several investment firms have recognized Solana as one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies of 2026, highlighting strong institutional interest alongside an active user base.\nSui Network (SUI)\nSui Network is a newcomer that is quickly making a name for itself, thanks to its innovative architecture and developer-friendly approach. Built by former Meta engineers, the network uses parallel execution to process transactions more efficiently than many competitors. Developers praise Sui for the ease of coding and testing applications, especially in gaming and NFT projects.\nGaming studios have started exploring the platform for new experiences, suggesting that Sui could play a central role if crypto gaming gains traction this year. Its scalability and developer-focused tools make it a promising option for those looking at long-term growth potential.\nEthena (ENA)\nEthena stands out by combining decentralized finance with a novel approach to stablecoins. Its internet bond, the USDe token, offers staking yields that are fully on-chain and censorship-resistant. This model is not a traditional stablecoin and not a typical yield farm, but it appeals to DeFi users looking for something new.\nEthena quickly attracted billions in Total Value Locked and has significant support from crypto-native venture capital firms. By blending security, yield, and innovation, Ethena positions itself to lead the next phase of DeFi growth. If the synthetic dollar trend continues, Ethena could become a central player in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\nEach of these three cryptos bring something unique to the table. Solana delivers speed and real-world payment adoption, Sui offers developer-friendly scalability, and Ethena innovates in DeFi with synthetic dollar staking. Investors looking for growth opportunities in 2026 should watch these projects closely. Understanding their strengths and potential applications can help make more informed decisions."

                "body": "Asia stocks rise on tech rally; Nikkei hits record high on snap election reports\nInvesting.com -- U.S. stocks ended the week at record levels on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report reinforced hopes for a steadier growth outlook.\nThe S&P 500 advanced 0.65% to close at 6,966.28, briefly touching an all-time high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.81% to 23,671.35, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gained 238 points, or 0.48%, to finish at 49,504.07, also a record close.\nAll three benchmarks posted solid weekly gains. The S&P 500 added just over 1% for the week, while the Dow and Nasdaq rose 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\nDecember\u2019s employment report showed payroll growth of 50,000, undershooting expectations for 73,000. While the headline figure was weaker than forecast, investors viewed the data as evidence that the U.S. economy remains resilient, with room for momentum to rebuild.\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%, compared with estimates of 4.5%, which traders interpreted as a modest positive signal.\nThe report was also the first set of jobs data not distorted by last year\u2019s prolonged government shutdown, which had delayed or disrupted several key economic releases. With data flow now normalizing, markets are turning their attention to inflation figures and upcoming policy decisions.\nWhile stocks have started 2026 on solid ground, the coming week could test market momentum as the fourth-quarter earnings season begins, inflation data looms, and geopolitical tensions remain high.\nTuesday\u2019s release of December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) is expected to be closely watched ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s late-January meeting. The central bank cut rates at its final three meetings of 2025, but the timing of any further easing remains uncertain.\n\u201cDecember CPI report should kick off a run of high-side core CPI readings,\u201d JPMorgan strategists led by Bruce Kasman said in a note.\nThey expect an initial 0.4% month-on-month rise next week and see core CPI accelerating to an annual pace above 3% by May.\n\u201cAgainst this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\u201d they added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a nominee in the coming weeks to succeed Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chair ends in May.\nTrump has repeatedly called for lower interest rates and applied uncommon pressure on the central bank, prompting questions over how independently his pick would operate. Trump\u2019s nominee would require Senate confirmation.\nQ4 earnings season begins this week\nAlso this week, large U.S. banks are set to open the fourth-quarter earnings season, with earnings growth a key pillar supporting investor optimism.\nThe new reporting season will begin with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s report on Tuesday, followed by Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs later in the week.\nGoldman Sachs says that consensus expects EPS growth of 7% year over year, but argues this \u201cappears too conservative once again,\u201d pointing out that S&P 500 earnings grew by 10% or more in each of the first three quarters of 2025 and beat analyst expectations by an average of about six percentage points.\nWhat analysts are saying about U.S. stocks\nJPMorgan: \"We believe that the growth-policy tradeoff will be favourable for equities, at least through 1H of this year. Economic activity is likely to be supported by a relatively easy monetary and fiscal backdrop in the US and EuroArea, while inflation rates are likely to keep moving lower.\"\n\"Within our constructive equity outlook, driven by supportive Growth-Inflation tradeoff that we see for 2026, we believe that Cyclical sectors will be the outperformers.\"\nGoldman Sachs: \"The 4Q earnings season will represent another important test for big tech andn the AI trade.

                "body": "US stock futures dipped in early trading on Tuesday, January 13, amid caution ahead of the highly anticipated US CPI report.\nHowever, a weaker Japanese yen cushioned the downside as markets considered the China-Japan political spat, a potential snap election, and BoJ policy uncertainty. USD/JPY climbed 0.36% to 158.692, its highest level since January 2025, fueling yen carry trades into US risk assets.\nDespite the morning losses, optimism about the earnings season, bets on two Fed rate cuts in 2026, and a resilient US economy support a bullish medium-term outlook for US equity futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nPolitical and monetary policy uncertainty sent USD/JPY higher in early trading as markets considered a potential snap election in February in Japan. A strong election win would strengthen Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s push for fiscal policy measures. USD/JPY has surged 7.9% since Prime Minister Takaichi became the Liberal Democratic Party leader.\nNotably, concerns about her fiscal policy plans have sent 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields to their highest levels since 1999 in morning trading.\nPrime Minister Takaichi\u2019s spending plans and Japan\u2019s sizeable debt-to-GDP ratio have increased risk premiums for holding JGBs, sending yields higher. Rising borrowing costs and a substantial national debt burden expose the Japanese economy to downside risks.\nUncertainty about the timing of Bank of Japan rate hikes contributed to the yen\u2019s weakness. US-Japan interest rate differentials remain firmly in favor of the US dollar, sending the USD/JPY pair higher.\nImportantly, the Nikkei 225 surged 3.08% in morning trading, benefiting from the weaker yen and the prospects of fiscal policy support. The China-Japan political spat added to the negative sentiment toward the yen.\nCrucially, the prevailing yen weakness sent USD/JPY into the intervention zone (157-160), raising the threat of government intervention in the forex markets, capping USD/JPY gains.\nUS futures saw modest losses during the Asian morning session on Tuesday, January 13, after a choppy start to the week.\nThe Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini fell 81 points and 10 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini slipped 22 points.\nLater Tuesday, the US CPI report will influence sentiment regarding the Fed rate path. Economists forecast headline inflation to remain at 2.7% in December, while forecasting core inflation to rise from 2.6% in November to 2.7% in December. December\u2019s figures will likely dictate the timeline for a Fed rate cut, given the stronger-than-expected US jobs report.\nSofter inflation would likely support a more dovish rate path, boosting demand for risk assets. Typically, lower borrowing costs would boost earnings and equity valuations.\nHeadline inflation fell from 3% in October to 2.7% in November. However, economists attributed the drop to the US government shutdown, curbing consumption, suggesting that \u2018in line\u2019 with forecast numbers would boost bets on a March Fed rate cut.\nGiven the significance of the CPI report, traders should closely monitor reactions from Fed speakers to the numbers and views on rate cuts.\nBeyond the economic calendar, corporate earnings will influence risk appetite. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) will kick off the earnings season on Tuesday.\nThe current dynamics, including market optimism over corporate earnings and expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, affirm the cautiously bullish near-term and bullish medium-term price outlook.\nDespite the morning pullback, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini traded above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs indicated a bullish short- to medium-term outlook, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical risks, US inflation, corporate earnings, and Fed forward guidance. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100"

No one\u2014certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve\u2014is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\u201d\nThe chair also claimed this was not about the renovation of Fed's buildings but was a \u201cconsequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president\u201d.\nSpeaking to NBC News, President Donald Trump denied any involvement and said: \u201cI do not know anything about it, but [Powell\u2019s] certainly not very good at the Fed, and he is not very good at building buildings.\u201d\nGold rallied following the news, reaching highs of $4,612, but settling at $4,605 at time of reporting, according to data from MarketWatch.\nSo far this year, gold prices have increased by 6% as investors have continued to look for safe havens during times of geopolitical upheaval.\nUS President Donald Trump has revealed plans to increase defence spending from $1trn to $1.5trn in 2027, to be paid for using the \u201ctremendous income\u201d from his tariff regime.\nTaking to social media on Wednesday (7 January), the president also issued a warning that he would \u201cnot permit\u201d US defence companies to issue share buybacks or dividends until they addressed his concerns about production speed and product reliability.\nDespite this, the spending proposals were enough to see stocks in the defence sector rally, with BAE Systems opening the day more than 6% up while Lockheed Martin was similarly up by over 6% in pre-market trading at the time of reporting, according to data from MarketWatch.\nHowever, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, urged investors to watch the bond market closely as Trump\u2019s proposals \u201ccould put even more pressure on the already sky-high US national debt\u201d.\n\u201cWhile Trump insists any extra spending would be paid for by tariffs, bond markets might not be as convinced. Equity markets are already looking a bit doubtful, with futures prices implying a red day for Wall Street,\u201d Mould added.\nS&P 500 futures were trading 0.17% lower, while Dow Jones futures we"

                "body": "DAX 40 continues to push to new highs\nThe DAX 40 sees six consecutive days of gains as the index pushes to new highs driven by risk-on sentimentThe DAX 40 has extended its rally to six consecutive sessions, pushing firmly into record territory and highlighting strong underlying bullish momentum. This persistence suggests that investors have been willing to buy into strength rather than take profits, a sign of confidence supported by both global and local drivers. Technically, the index has benefitted from sustained dip-buying and a lack of meaningful downside catalysts, allowing the trend to remain intact.\nDrivers of the Rally\nA key driver of the rally has been the broader improvement in global risk appetite. Strength in US equities, optimism around growth themes such as AI, and fading fears of aggressive further monetary tightening have helped lift equity sentiment worldwide. As a cyclical and export-heavy index, the DAX tends to outperform in these risk-on environments, attracting inflows as investors rotate into economically sensitive markets.\nSector performance has also played an important role. Industrial heavyweights and defence-related stocks have delivered strong gains, providing significant support to the index given their large weightings. This has allowed the DAX to advance even as domestic German economic data remains mixed. The index\u2019s global revenue exposure means earnings prospects are more closely tied to international demand than to Germany\u2019s near-term growth outlook alone.\nExpectations around European Central Bank policy have further underpinned the move. Softer inflation dynamics in the euro area and the perception that the ECB has no reason to start tightening again have helped support equity valuations, particularly for rate-sensitive sectors. Compared with the US, European policy expectations appear more benign, which has encouraged relative inflows into European equities, including the DAX.\nGeopolitical Risks\nDespite the positive momentum, geopolitical tensions present a meaningful risk premium that could temper sentiment. Iran is experiencing intense internal unrest sparked by its deepening economic crisis, steep currency depreciation, and nationwide protests, which have now spread across provinces and drawn heavy crackdowns by authorities.\nWhile the DAX\u2019s rally reflects optimism and technical strength, geopolitical risk, especially as it relates to Iran\u2019s unrest and US-Iran tensions, represents a latent headwind that could dampen sentiment if events escalate further. Risk-off impulses triggered by sharp geopolitical shocks typically benefit safe havens (bonds, gold) and can weigh on equities, particularly cyclicals and export-exposed indices like the DAX. In the near term, markets may remain resilient as long as geopolitical developments stay contained, but a sudden spike in tensions, military engagement, or significant disruptions to energy supply routes could prompt a swift reappraisal of risk assets.\nWhat to watch next\nWhile momentum remains strong, the rally is not without risks. After several consecutive gains, the index is more vulnerable to short-term profit-taking, especially if incoming macro data disappoints or if global risk sentiment deteriorates. In the near term, the sustainability of the move will depend on whether supportive global conditions persist and whether buyers continue to defend recent breakout levels. A period of consolidation would not be unusual after such a run, but the broader trend remains constructive as long as risk appetite holds.\nOn the daily chart we can see that the DAX 40 has broken above the range that held throughout most of 2025, with the move above 25,000 a key psychological milestone. However, the RSI has started to venture into overbought territory for the first time since February last year, which could attract some selling momentum.\nDAX 40 daily chart\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results."

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect inflation to have remained steady last month.\nThe data takes on added importance after December\u2019s jobs report pointed to a cooling labor market. Futures markets are currently pricing in two quarter-point cuts in 2026, with the first expected in June, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\nDuring Monday\u2019s regular session, stocks pushed to new highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) both notched fresh records, as investors largely shrugged off headlines surrounding a Justice Department criminal investigation involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nPowell, whose term expires in May, characterized the probe as political pressure from President Trump, who has repeatedly called for aggressive rate cuts. Markets have largely dismissed those efforts, noting the Fed already lowered interest rates three times in late 2025 to support economic growth.\nStill, bank stocks faced some pressure after Trump proposed a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. Separately, the president said Monday evening that countries continuing business with Iran would face a 25% US tariff, adding another layer of geopolitical uncertainty to the market backdrop.\nAttention is looking ahead to corporate earnings, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) set to report fourth-quarter results before Tuesday\u2019s opening bell. The report kicks off a busy stretch for big banks on Wall Street, with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) scheduled to follow later in the week.\nLIVE 2 updates"

Both indexes touched fresh all-time intraday highs and closed at records. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.26% and closed at 23,733.90.\nThe major averages rebounded off their worst levels of the session, helped by gains in Walmart and some technology stocks. The Dow was down nearly 500 points, and the S&P 500 was off 0.5% at session lows. Alongside the S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow, the Russell 2000 index notched a fresh all-time high as well.\nTrump's call to cap credit card rates for one year at 10% was also causing some market indigestion to start the week. Critics fear Trump's plan to aid affordability would backfire and restrict lending, hurting consumers \u2014 along with bank profitability. Bank stocks were the hardest hit Monday, with Citigroup down about 3%. JPMorgan and Bank of America were off by more than 1%. Capital One shares slid 6%.\n\"It doesn't matter that much, in some sense,\" Rob Williams, chief investment strategist at Sage, told CNBC. \"I think it's some noise, and it's not even pushing rates around that much ... the focus is going to be on data,\" he continued, pointing to the upcoming release of the consumer price index for December on Tuesday.\nThe S&P 500 clawed its way back into the green after starting off the session lower. U.S. equities were under pressure following Powell's confirmation in an unusual direct video statement Sunday evening that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation related to his Senate Banking Committee testimony on the renovation of Fed office buildings. Powell said the investigation was another attempt by Trump to influence the central bank's monetary policy and he would not bow to the pressure. His term as chair is up in May.\nThe stock market in 2025 largely ignored Trump's attempts to pressure the Fed as the central bank went on anyway to cut rates three times as inflation stabilized. But the Fed is largely expected to hold off on further cuts when it next meets later this month as it waits to see how the inflation picture and economy unfold in the new year. Trump has made clear he would like to see the Fed continue to bring rates lower.\n\"The impact of Chairman Powell being under investigation is likely a long-term impact, meaning it's not going to change interest rates in the near term; it's not going to change inflation in the near term,\" Jim Lebenthal, chief markets strategist at Cerity Partners, said to CNBC.\nWith the anticipation of \"pretty good\" earnings this week and CPI possibly coming in \"well below 3%,\" not to mention an economy that's \"growing rapidly,\" Lebenthal said that there are just \"too many good things\" in the short term. That's what's keeping the broader market higher, even if the investigation spells bad news in the long term, he said.\n\"Anybody who is on the Federal Open Market Committee understands that if they don't do what the president wants, if they don't lower rates, they may be fired the way Lisa Cook has been at least theoretically fired or they may be the subject of an investigation the way Chairman Powell is,\" Lebenthal continued. \"For the new chairman and for anyone on the board, they're going to be more inclined to lower interest rates. That will eventually cause inflation, and it will eventually cause higher long-term interest rates, but those effects are not going to be felt until the end of the year at the earliest.\"\nGold futures, which are seen as a hedge against diminishing Fed independence, jumped 2.5% and posted a record close of $4,614.7.

                "body": "RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement has picked up steam in statehouses. Here's what to expect in 2026.\nWhen one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.\n\"We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,\" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. \"There are real impacts on real kids.\"\nThe Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.\nThe bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nChemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans \u2014 and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program \u2014 created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas \u2014 offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.\nFederal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as \"forever chemicals\" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.\nIn addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.\nMost synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.\nMajor food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.\n\"We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,\" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.\nThis past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.\n\"The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,\" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.\nAndy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.\n\"It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,\" Baker-White said.\nAlthough Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 SNAP, or food stamp"

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\nNew dietary guidelines from the Trump administration have some big asks of Americans, from prioritizing protein to avoiding highly processed food. The most onerous directive, though, was probably for moms and dads.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins want them to stop giving their kids sugar until they turn 11.\nThat, says Keri Rodrigues, a mother of five boys and the president of the National Parents Union, is \u201ccompletely unrealistic.\u201d Her group, which has been critical of other administration policies, represents 1.7 million parents.\n\u201cSugar is everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in bread, it\u2019s in all kinds of other things,\u201d she said.\nNo one is saying kids can\u2019t eat foods that contain natural sugar, such as bananas and fresh mango, but avoiding added sugar \u2014 which most everyone agrees should be limited \u2014 would require incredible diligence. The old rules, which most parents failed to abide by, only asked them to hold the line till their kids turned 2.\nThe new guidance, strictly followed, would mean a wholesale overhaul of most kids\u2019 diets and the traditions of childhood. There\u2019d be no more Halloween candy, ice cream cones at the county fair, Cracker Jack at the ballgame or even a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich.\nThe guidelines are the government\u2019s declaration of war on added sugar, Kennedy said when announcing the new recommendations Wednesday, pointing to the high rates of obesity among American children. Approximately 1 in 5 American children and teens are obese, according to 2024 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe new guidelines, spearheaded by Kennedy and Rollins, say that no amount of added sugar is recommended or considered part of a healthy diet.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other health groups have praised the guidelines\u2019 recommendations for Americans to avoid added sugar.\nThe new guidelines tell parents to avoid any added sugar for children 4 and under and stress that \u201cno amount of sugar is recommended\u201d for kids between 5 and 10. The previous guidelines, in addition to asking parents to avoid giving kids sugar till 2, recommended that added sugars remain under 10 percent of daily calories for kids older than that.\nConsuming too much added sugar is linked to conditions such as weight gain and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in 2024 pointed to a 2021 survey showing that a majority of one-to-five year olds had consumed at least one sugary drink in the week prior to the survey.\nA Department of Health and Human Services official said highly processed foods, which often contain added sugar, trigger something akin to addiction, and early exposure can make it difficult to resist eating too much sugar later in life. POLITICO granted the official anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly.\nHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the dietary guidelines \u201care a guideline and recommendation for Americans.\u201d He stressed that they were only a recommendation.\nDietary guidelines affect how federal programs like school meals are run, but Americans have never faithfully adhered to them.\nTina Descovich, a mother of five and the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents\u2019 rights organization, said she thought it would be hard to comply with the new guidance once children start to attend school and play dates.\nDescovich recalled her time as a Brevard County, Fla., school board member between 2016 and 2020. Parents often complained about sugar-laden breakfast foods the kids were served, she said, adding that she agreed that getting such foods "

                "body": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 A landmark case accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against minority Muslim Rohingya will open at the United Nations\u2019 top court on Monday.\nIt will be the first genocide case the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hear in full in over a decade. The outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, most likely affecting South Africa\u2019s genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over the war in Gaza.\nMyanmar has denied accusations of genocide.\n\u201cThe case is likely to set critical precedents for how genocide is defined and how it can be proven, and how violations can be remedied,\u201d Nicholas Koumjian, head of the U.N.\u2019s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, told Reuters.\nThe predominantly Muslim West African country of Gambia filed the case at the ICJ \u2014 also known as the World Court \u2014 in 2019, accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya, a mainly Muslim minority in the remote western state of Rakhine.\nMyanmar\u2019s armed forces launched an offensive in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson.\nA U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the 2017 military offensive had included \u201cgenocidal acts.\u201d\nMyanmar authorities rejected that report, saying its military offensive was a legitimate counterterrorism campaign in response to attacks by Muslim militants.\nIn 2019 preliminary hearings in the ICJ case, Myanmar\u2019s leader at the time, Aung San Suu Kyi, rejected Gambia\u2019s accusations of genocide as \u201cincomplete and misleading.\u201d\nThe hearings at the ICJ will mark the first time that Rohingya victims of the alleged atrocities will be heard by an international court, although those sessions will be closed to the public and the media for sensitivity and privacy reasons.\nThe hearings start at 10 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) on Monday and will span three weeks.\nMyanmar has been in further turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, setting off a nationwide armed rebellion.\nThe country is holding phased elections that have been criticized by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as neither free nor fair."

A snap election might strengthen her political position and allow her to govern more freely.\nBonds fell, with the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds hitting 2.135%, and the yen weakened into \u00a5158-to-the-dollar territory following the reports of a possible election.\nFinance Minister Satsuki Katayama, who met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington over the weekend, said she told Bessent that she was \"concerned about one-sided yen moves\u201d and that Bessent \u201cshared that understanding.\u201d\nKatayama had previously warned of currency intervention, saying that the financial authorities have a \u201cfree hand\u201d to take action against excessive currency moves."

The move followed a public holiday in Japan, with local investors reacting to new all-time highs in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, where technology stocks led gains.\nSentiment was also buoyed by speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call an early election in the coming weeks to strengthen her coalition\u2019s parliamentary position. Local media reported discussions within the ruling bloc, and coalition partner Ishin said Takaichi had met party leaders last week. Markets widely interpret the prospect of an early election as a signal for more proactive fiscal spending.\nCurrency dynamics reinforced the equity rally. The yen remained sharply weaker than at the previous Tokyo close, boosting the overseas earnings outlook for Japan\u2019s export-heavy corporates. Earlier verbal intervention from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, who flagged concerns over one-sided currency moves, had little lasting impact on FX markets, leaving USD/JPY elevated and supportive for equities.\nJapanese stocks also appeared largely unfazed by political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve, with investors following global peers in brushing aside concerns over the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nOverall, the session underscored how a weak yen continues to trump intervention rhetoric, amplifying global risk-on momentum and reinforcing Japan equities\u2019 leadership at the start of the year.\n---\nUSD/JPY rising still:"
