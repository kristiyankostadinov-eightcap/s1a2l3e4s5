                "body": "Should you invest in gold before the October Fed meeting?\nIf you invested in gold in recent years, chances are good that you benefited from multiple features the precious metal offers.\nDepending on when you bought it, you may have realized a significant return on your investment, thanks to the record-breaking price run the metal has experienced. You also probably weathered the economic impacts felt by decades-high inflation in a safer way, thanks to gold's ability to hedge against inflation and diversify portfolios.\nBut that's all on the assumption that you invested in gold in the right type at the right time. If you didn't, then your portfolio may have suffered right when you needed the protection gold offers most. Fortunately, there's still time to get invested, although many want to be aggressive now. And that means investing in gold before the Federal Reserve's next meeting on October 29. Below, we'll explain why.\nStart comparing your top gold investing options online here.\nShould you invest in gold before the October Fed meeting?\nWith the next meeting held by the central bank barely a week away, investors who have yet to add gold to their portfolio may want to strongly consider doing so now. Here's why:\nPrices could rise after the October Fed meeting\nWhile not a guarantee, gold prices often rise when the Fed cuts interest rates and decline when the Fed raises them. Lower interest rates, after all, tend to make interest-earning vehicles less attractive, causing investors to turn to alternatives like gold instead, thus raising its price. And with the chances of a Fed rate cut on October 29 around 99% now, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, another gold price hike looks increasingly likely. Get invested, then, before you get priced out of the market permanently.\nGet started with gold online today.\nPrices could rise even before the meeting\nGold prices have been on a remarkable rise over the past two years or so. Just look at the performance of the metal since March, when it broke a record $3,000 per ounce. By early October the $4,000 mark had been surpassed, and as of October 20, the price of the metal now sits at $4,327.50 per ounce. It's not unrealistic to expect the price to rise to $5,000 per ounce, either.\nWaiting for it to hit its next record doesn't make sense, then, especially when you can still exploit affordable ways to get started with fractional gold bullion and a dollar-cost averaging approach. With factors like inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over domestic economic policy now, the price of gold could spike again, perhaps even before the Fed concludes its next meeting.\nYour portfolio needs the protections gold offers now\nWith inflation rising in the most recently released report and unemployment ticking up, too, there are multiple factors that could already be eroding your portfolio, depending on what you're invested in now. Add in growing concerns over the extended government shutdown and your portfolio could very well use the protections gold offers now versus waiting for the Fed's next meeting to conclude.\nConsider taking the time to determine which gold type makes the most sense for your needs and goals. Just don't wait for a \"perfect\" time to get started either, especially if your portfolio already needs a boost.\nThe bottom line\nThere are multiple reasons why rapid action on the behalf of prospective gold investors makes sense now, before the Fed gets together again to determine monetary policy. Start exploring the types available to you, then, and consider speaking with a representative from one of the top gold IRA companies who can answer any questions you may have. Just be careful with how much you ultimately do invest in the metal as many experts recommend capping the precious metal portion of your portfolio at 10% (accounting for other types like silver, too)."

                "body": "Gold Price Rally Fueled by Rate Cut Anticipation and Inflation Data Watch\nGold prices experienced a significant surge on Monday, initially climbing over 2%, fueled by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will further cut interest rates in the near future. This is compounded by sustained safe-haven demand amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nIn pre-market trading on Monday, spot gold reclaimed the $4330 level, while New York gold futures touched $4350 per ounce, marking an intraday increase exceeding 3%.\nLooking Back at Recent Gold Performance\nLast Friday, gold prices briefly hit a record high of $4370 before rapidly retreating to close down 1.8%, the largest single-day drop since mid-May. This pullback was attributed to comments from the then-President alleviating some market concerns.\nExpert Analysis\nJeffrey Christian, managing partner at CPM Group, noted that investors' worries about the US political and economic landscape are driving gold prices higher, particularly after the heavy selling witnessed on Friday.\nHe added, \"We expect gold prices to continue to rise in the coming weeks and months, and we wouldn't be surprised if gold reaches $4500 per ounce soon.\"\nImpact of Government Shutdown and Delayed Economic Data\nThe US government shutdown entered its 20th day on Monday, following senators' repeated failures to break the deadlock. The shutdown has also delayed the release of key economic data, leaving investors and Fed policymakers in a data vacuum ahead of next week's policy meeting. The delayed US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is now scheduled for release this Friday.\nRate Cut Predictions\nConcurrently, traders are pricing in a 99% probability of a Fed rate cut at the upcoming meeting, with another cut expected in December. As a non-yielding asset, gold typically performs well in a low-interest-rate environment.\nFuture Outlook\nChristian concluded, \"I wouldn't be surprised if gold reaches $5000 per ounce sometime next year. That will depend on continuing and worsening political problems, which is what we're facing right now.\"\nKey Factors Influencing Gold Prices\nIt's important to note that gold prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n* **Interest Rates:** Interest rate changes significantly affect gold's attractiveness as an investment.\n* **Inflation:** Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation.\n* **Economic Growth:** Global economic growth influences demand for gold in sectors like jewelry and industry.\n* **Geopolitical Risks:** Geopolitical tensions increase demand for gold as a safe haven.\n* **US Dollar Value:** Gold has an inverse relationship with the value of the US dollar.\nA thorough analysis of these factors can help investors understand gold price movements and make informed decisions.\nRisk Warning: this article represents only the author\u2019s views and is for reference only.

Also, China's Sep industrial production rose +6.5% y/y, stronger than expectations of +5.0% y/y.\nConcerns about a global supply glut are a major bearish factor for crude prices.

Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -12% w/w to 78.44 million bbl in the week ended October 17.\nCrude prices found support after OPEC+ on October 5 agreed to a 137,000 bpd increase in its crude production target, starting in November, which was less than market expectations of a potential 500,000 bpd boost to production. OPEC+ is in the midst of boosting output by a further 1.66 million bpd to fully reverse the 2.2 million bpd production cut seen in early 2024. OPEC's September crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 29.05 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\nReduced crude exports from Russia are supportive of oil prices. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past two months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries and oil export terminals have curbed Russia's total seaborne fuel shipments to 1.88 million bpd in the first ten days of October, the lowest average in over 3.25 years.\nThe outlook for higher crude production in Iraq is expected to boost global oil supplies, which is bearish for crude prices. Iraq recently announced that it had reached an agreement with the regional government of Kurdistan to resume oil exports from the Kurdish region via a pipeline to Turkey, which had been halted for the past two years due to a payment dispute. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hussein said that the resumption of crude exports could add 500,000 bpd of fresh oil supplies to global markets.\nCrude prices have support from concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. The US proposed that the G7 allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\nLast Thursday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of October 10 were -3.4% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were +0.1% above the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -6.9% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending October 10 rose +0.1% "

As a key OPEC member, Algeria\u2019s move is set to increase volatility in global energy prices. Investors are keenly watching how these changes will influence the already precarious supply chains worldwide.\nAlgeria Oil Exports: A New Chapter\nAlgeria\u2019s decision to adjust oil production underscores Sonatrach\u2019s growing influence. As of today, Sonatrach has announced a 5% cut in output. This move aims to stabilize prices amid global fluctuations. With Algeria responsible for a significant share of OPEC\u2019s output, its actions are creating ripples across the energy markets. This shows Algeria\u2019s strategic role in balancing supply and demand. By reducing production, Algeria is aiming to maintain higher global energy prices. Reuters reports on the immediate effects of this shift.\nSonatrach Production Cuts: Impact on Global Prices\nSonatrach\u2019s production cuts come at a critical time. The global energy market is experiencing unprecedented volatility, impacted by geopolitical tensions. By reducing their output, Algeria is leveraging its position to stabilize prices. This action is likely to support global energy prices, which have been under pressure. These cuts highlight the complex dynamics of international trade and energy economics, with OPEC member Algeria taking a proactive role. Investors are closely observing these moves to gauge future market directions.\nOPEC Member Algeria: Strategic Moves in a Volatile Market\nAs an influential OPEC member, Algeria\u2019s strategic output cuts are pivotal. OPEC, which coordinates oil policy among member countries, relies heavily on cooperation. Algeria\u2019s move aligns with broader strategic goals to manage market stability and prevent oversupply. This decision not only influences global energy prices but also strengthens Algeria\u2019s standing within OPEC. These actions demonstrate Algeria\u2019s commitment to supporting OPEC\u2019s mission while protecting its own economic interests.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn conclusion, Algeria\u2019s recent adjustments in oil production through Sonatrach indicate a strategic move to influence global energy prices. As an OPEC member, Algeria\u2019s contribution is critical in maintaining market stability. These production cuts reflect both a response to global economic conditions and a tactic to uphold Algeria\u2019s economic interests. For investors, this signals a shift in market dynamics where individual player decisions can rapidly impact global energy trends. Observing Algeria\u2019s forthcoming steps will be essential as they continue to play a strategic role in global energy markets.\nFAQs\nAlgeria\u2019s production cuts are likely to stabilize or increase global energy prices by reducing supply amidst ongoing market volatility, thereby maintaining higher price levels.\nAlgeria is crucial to OPEC due to its significant oil reserves and output, which influence global supply and demand dynamics. Its strategic decisions can impact global energy stability.\nSonatrach\u2019s production adjustments can lead to heightened investor attention due to potential impacts on energy stocks and commodities, affecting market sentiment and investment strategies.\nDisclaimer:\nThis is for information only, not financial advice.

In the last five months, the commodity has seen a sharp drop of over 7%, and is currently trading slightly over $60.\nSeveral factors converge to explain this slump. First, the International Energy Agency upgraded its forecast for global oil supply while lowering projected demand growth, warning of a potential surplus of up to three to four million barrels per day extending into 2026.\nSecondly, major oil producers including OPEC+ and non-OPEC nations are lifting output, stretching inventories despite stagnant consumption, especially in key markets like China. Third, escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have raised fresh red flags over future demand from two of the largest oil consumers.\nIn addition, China\u2019s recent sharp drop in crude import flows signals weaker incremental demand, undercutting the notion of global restocking. As a result, bearish sentiment has intensified: traders are wary of oil market congestion, with storage constraints rising and futures curve patterns shifting into deeper contango, all telling signs that \u201cnow\u201d is less valuable than the future.\nAt the pump, softer crude means relief for fuels and chemicals in importing nations. But for the energy sector and oil-exporting countries, the pressure is building as profit margins are squeezed and policy risks are rising. With the market already testing $60-ish for Brent, the next decisive move will depend on either a sharp recovery in demand or a meaningful cutback in supply.\nRecently, HSBC warned of a potential downside risk to its 2026 Brent crude forecast of $65 per barrel if oil stockpiles in Western markets continue to build up.\nNotably, US President Donald Trump urged European Union officials to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China, as part of his broader strategy to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIn a note released on Monday, the bank said that while it does not expect a complete loss of Russian supply, it anticipates challenges for Russia in ramping up production to meet OPEC+ quotas. Consequently, the bank trimmed its end-2026 Russian output forecast by 300,000 barrels per day, projecting only a modest increase in production."

OPEC+ is in the midst of boosting output by a further 1.66 million bpd to fully reverse the 2.2 million bpd production cut seen in early 2024. OPEC's September crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 29.05 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\nReduced crude exports from Russia are supportive of oil prices. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past two months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries and oil export terminals have curbed Russia's total seaborne fuel shipments to 1.88 million bpd in the first ten days of October, the lowest average in over 3.25 years.\nThe outlook for higher crude production in Iraq is expected to boost global oil supplies, which is bearish for crude prices. Iraq recently announced that it had reached an agreement with the regional government of Kurdistan to resume oil exports from the Kurdish region via a pipeline to Turkey, which had been halted for the past two years due to a payment dispute. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hussein said that the resumption of crude exports could add 500,000 bpd of fresh oil supplies to global markets.\nCrude prices have support from concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. The US proposed that the G7 allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\nLast Thursday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of October 10 were -3.4% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were +0.1% above the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -6.9% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending October 10 rose +0.1% "

As a key OPEC member, Algeria\u2019s move is set to increase volatility in global energy prices. Investors are keenly watching how these changes will influence the already precarious supply chains worldwide.\nAlgeria Oil Exports: A New Chapter\nAlgeria\u2019s decision to adjust oil production underscores Sonatrach\u2019s growing influence. As of today, Sonatrach has announced a 5% cut in output. This move aims to stabilize prices amid global fluctuations. With Algeria responsible for a significant share of OPEC\u2019s output, its actions are creating ripples across the energy markets. This shows Algeria\u2019s strategic role in balancing supply and demand. By reducing production, Algeria is aiming to maintain higher global energy prices. Reuters reports on the immediate effects of this shift.\nSonatrach Production Cuts: Impact on Global Prices\nSonatrach\u2019s production cuts come at a critical time. The global energy market is experiencing unprecedented volatility, impacted by geopolitical tensions. By reducing their output, Algeria is leveraging its position to stabilize prices. This action is likely to support global energy prices, which have been under pressure. These cuts highlight the complex dynamics of international trade and energy economics, with OPEC member Algeria taking a proactive role.

This decision not only influences global energy prices but also strengthens Algeria\u2019s standing within OPEC. These actions demonstrate Algeria\u2019s commitment to supporting OPEC\u2019s mission while protecting its own economic interests.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn conclusion, Algeria\u2019s recent adjustments in oil production through Sonatrach indicate a strategic move to influence global energy prices. As an OPEC member, Algeria\u2019s contribution is critical in maintaining market stability.

The major currency pair faces selling pressure as the US Dollar (USD) gains on hopes that the ongoing United States (US) government shutdown will end this week.\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, extends its upside to near 98.70.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

The inflation data will significantly influence market expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) monetary policy outlook.\nThough investors have underpinned the US Dollar against the Euro (EUR), the latter trades higher against its other peers on expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not reduce interest rates further this year. A slew of ECB officials have stated that interest rates should remain at their current levels unless they gauge the scope of US tariffs' impact on prices.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not"

                "body": "EUR/USD Forecast: Currency Pair of the Week | October 20, 2025\n- EUR/USD forecast remains tilted higher amid Fed rate cut bets\n- France\u2019s political calm, weakening oil prices and US credit market concerns among short-term drivers\n- Global PMIs and US CPI due on Friday\nLast week saw the euro quietly firm up against the dollar, though not so much because of any great eurozone strength, rather, it\u2019s the dollar that\u2019s looking fragile. Markets have been caught off guard by the sudden re-emergence of concerns surrounding US regional banks, while economic data releases have been delayed because of the government shutdown. Fed officials have stuck to the script without any new official information on inflation and employment. Looking ahead, Friday\u2019s delayed US CPI release may add a touch of volatility, but unless inflation deviates sharply from expectations this is unlikely to change the narrative of two more rate cuts for 2025. From the eurozone side of things, economic data has been far from convincing, but this has been outweighed by weakening oil prices and expectations of big spending by German government. Against this backdrop, the EUR/USD forecast remains positive.\nEUR/USD forecast boosted by oil prices and French political breakthrough\nThe euro\u2019s gains are less about its own strength and more about the dollar\u2019s weakness. But the weakening oil prices are certainly negative for the dollar and positive for importing nations like Japan or economic regions like the Eurozone. If US banking concerns deepen or the upcoming CPI data reinforces the case for rate cuts, the path towards 1.1800, and possibly beyond, remains open.\nMeanwhile, political crisis in France had weighed on business and consumer sentiment there. But last week, there was hope as the French prime minister survived two confidence votes. This allowed the French CAC to join the global market rally. Still, the underlying fiscal challenges remain unresolved. Freezing the pension reform might have bought the government some breathing space, but it\u2019s also limited room for budgetary manoeuvre. Nevertheless, the FX and equity markets have chosen to focus on the short-term and for that reason risk appetite has remained firm.\nMacro highlights: Global PMIs and US CPI\nThis week\u2019s key data highlights include the latest PMI data and the delayed release of US CPI, both set for publication on Friday.\nWe have seen a number of weaker hard data from the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy Germany of late, and this has held back the euro. The focus will now turn to the Eurozone PMIs on Friday. If they surprise to the downside, this will only underscore the need for more fiscal stimulus from Germany. Any positive readings should give the euro and immediate boost.\nMeanwhile, the BLS is expected to release the delayed US CPI on the same day. Expectations point to a month-over-month reading of 0.4% for the headline and 0.3% for the core CPI. If this is the case, a rate cut at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting would be further cemented, potentially keeping the EUR/USD exchange rate supported. All told however, inflation is unlikely to have major implications for the FX markets, given that the Fed\u2019s focus is now on employment. That said, a massive beat or miss should still cause significant volatility.\nTechnical EUR/USD forecast and key levels to watch\nFor now, the EUR/USD forecast looks cautiously constructive from a technical standpoint, after the pair broke out of a consolidation pattern last week. As per the daily chart, the EUR/USD climbed out of the falling wedge pattern to the upside last week, before encountering some resistance around 1.1700. Given the bullish breakout, the path of least resistance on the EUR/USD is now confirmed to the upside, even if momentum is lacking. Support is seen around 1.1650, then 1.1600, with the former being a prior S/R level and the latter marking the broken resistance trend of the aforementioned continuation pattern.\nShould the ally resume here, the next upside target fo"

The single currency recovered modestly after Friday\u2019s decline from 1.1730, where buyers failed to break higher amid renewed demand for the U.S. dollar during the American session.\nMonday\u2019s session opened on a cautious note after Germany\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.1% month-over-month in September\u2014its third consecutive contraction\u2014following declines of 0.5% and 0.1% in August and July, respectively. On an annual basis, prices dropped 1.7%, underscoring persistent disinflation in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The data added weight to concerns that Eurozone manufacturing remains under pressure even as broader risk appetite improves globally.\nAt the same time, the U.S. dollar has struggled to extend gains as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to 98.40, its lowest in three weeks, reflecting investor caution during the 19-day government shutdown in Washington. The political gridlock has raised the probability of two Fed rate cuts before year-end\u2014one in October and another in December\u2014fully priced in by futures markets.\nMacro Backdrop: U.S. Shutdown and Fed Outlook Shift Market Sentiment\nThe prolonged U.S. government closure has begun to dent confidence in the greenback. Key data releases, including CPI, have been delayed, clouding near-term policy guidance. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem signaled readiness to ease further if job-market risks persist, reinforcing the dovish tilt that has underpinned the euro\u2019s stability despite weak domestic data.\nMeanwhile, political developments continue to shape sentiment. President Donald Trump\u2019s acknowledgment that proposed 100% tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable, combined with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s planned talks with China\u2019s Vice Premier He Lifeng, have eased fears of a renewed trade escalation. This improvement in global tone has reduced demand for the dollar as a safe haven and supported risk currencies like the euro and the Australian dollar, the latter rising 0.1% against the greenback.\nECB Policy Under Scrutiny as Schnabel and Nagel Take the Stage\nAttention in Europe now shifts to upcoming remarks from ECB board member Isabel Schnabel and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel, scheduled for later today. Markets expect Schnabel to reinforce the ECB\u2019s cautious approach, acknowledging disinflation but refraining from pre-committing to additional stimulus. Nagel, typically more hawkish, may emphasize the risk of prolonged fiscal expansion, particularly as France\u2019s credit downgrade to A+ from AA- by S&P Global Ratings has revived concerns over Eurozone fiscal discipline.\nThis policy divergence could create short-term volatility in EUR/USD, especially if the ECB appears reluctant to match the Fed\u2019s anticipated easing trajectory. For now, the central bank\u2019s guidance has stressed patience, focusing on stabilizing inflation expectations near 2% while acknowledging uneven growth across member states.\nTechnical Landscape: Euro Trapped in Narrow Band Between 1.1600 and 1.1730\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains locked within a short-term consolidation zone, with resistance capped at 1.1685 and 1.1730, both marking rejection points from last week. On the downside, 1.1635 and 1.1600 provide critical support. A sustained break below 1.1600 would expose 1.1550\u20131.1545, the mid-October lows that anchored prior rebounds.\nMomentum indicators present a neutral stance.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped toward 98.40 after the 19-day government shutdown deepened, eroding investor confidence and fueling bets that the Federal Reserve could deliver two rate cuts before year-end. Futures markets now price a 100% probability of a 25-bp cut in October and a 96% chance of another in December, as officials such as St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem voiced support for further easing if employment risks rise.\nMixed Drivers Anchor the Pound Despite Fiscal and Labor Headwinds\nThe pound\u2019s latest rebound follows a recovery from 1.3250, its lowest level since early August. The move was largely technical, aided by short covering after a three-week slide and renewed inflows into risk assets. However, fundamentals remain uneven. UK labor data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.8%, a four-year high, while average earnings growth slowed to 4.7%, signaling weaker wage momentum. These figures reinforce expectations that the BoE could continue trimming rates gradually to support growth. Traders now anticipate one additional 25-bp rate cut before the November Autumn Budget, where fiscal consolidation measures are expected to weigh further on domestic demand.\nFiscal concerns have re-emerged as investors await details of the UK government\u2019s spending plans. Economists at ING warn that \u201ctighter fiscal and looser monetary policy should ultimately be a bit bearish for sterling.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt faces pressure to close a widening deficit without triggering a repeat of the 2022 gilt-market turmoil. Any hint of higher borrowing or delayed tax adjustments could rekindle volatility across gilt yields and spill into GBP/USD valuations.\nU.S. Dollar Volatility Keeps Cable Range-Bound\nDollar sentiment remains fragile amid prolonged political paralysis in Washington. The shutdown\u2019s economic cost is projected to shave 0.3 percentage points from U.S. Q4 GDP, further cementing expectations of monetary easing. Still, intermittent rebounds in the greenback have capped the pound\u2019s upside. The DXY briefly recovered from 98.00 to 98.68, testing resistance near its 50-day EMA at 98.59, before sellers re-entered.\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD continues to oscillate between 1.3380 and 1.3516, anchored by converging 50- and 200-day EMAs. A sustained break above 1.3450 could open room toward 1.3516, aligning with the September Volume Point of Control (VPOC), while failure to hold above 1.3380 risks a drop toward 1.3300 and potentially 1.3250 if risk aversion returns. The RSI (14) sits near 48, underscoring indecision after last week\u2019s rally, while momentum indicators remain neutral.\nTrade Tensions, CPI Data, and Risk Sentiment Set the Tone\nGlobal trade tensions continue to shape near-term flows. The renewed U.S.\u2013China tariff standoff has unsettled markets, but President Donald Trump\u2019s softer rhetoric this week\u2014expressing optimism about Chinese purchases of soybeans\u2014offered modest relief. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to meet Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to discuss tariff alignment, and any progress could lift risk sentiment and favor the pound.\nThe upcoming U.S. CPI report looms as the week\u2019s decisive catalyst. Consensus expects headline inflation to cool to 2.3% YoY, reinforcing the Fed\u2019s dovish bias. A softer print could accelerate the dollar\u2019s retreat and push GBP/USD closer to 1.3516"

This week\u2019s release calendar is dominated by Wednesday\u2019s CPI and Friday\u2019s retail sales. Preliminary PMI\u2019s will also be released on Friday. Fundamentals remain a secondary driver for the pound, as yield spreads extend their two-month consolidation and correlation studies reveal a newly negative relationship between GBP and spreads. Sentiment appears to be more dominant as a near-term driver, with risk reversals showing a 0.64 correlation to GBP on a 21-day rolling basis. Risk reversals remain deeply negative (pricing a premium for puts) but appear to be in the early stages of a recovery.\u201d\nLooking ahead to Tuesday\u2019s European session, the GBP/USD exchange rate is expected to be shaped primarily by a speech from Federal Reserve official Christopher Waller, as both the US and UK economic calendars remain notably quiet.\nLast week, Waller signalled the possibility of another US interest rate cut this year, citing ongoing concerns over the labour market and broader economic conditions.\nShould he echo these dovish remarks this week, the \u2018Greenback\u2019 could come under renewed pressure, potentially seeing USD exchange rates slip against its major rivals.\nMeanwhile, the UK data calendar is also devoid of notable releases, leaving Sterling without fresh domestic catalysts once more.\nIn this environment, GBP exchange rates are likely to remain confined within a narrow range, with trading largely guided by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than fundamental data.\nInvestor attention is expected to remain focused on Wednesday\u2019s CPI release, meaning traders may continue to exercise restraint, maintaining a cautious approach and limiting significant GBP/USD movement ahead of the key inflation figures.\nLike this piece?

AUD/USD slid after the disappointing labour market report intensified speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be forced to cut interest rates next month.\nAccording to the note from Standard Chartered:\n- money markets have sharply repriced the outlook for the RBA's upcoming meeting on 4 November\n- traders now pricing in a significantly higher probability of a 25-basis-point cut to the official cash rate\n- the prospect of a widening interest rate differential, with the RBA easing policy while other central banks potentially hold firm, is weighing on the currency\nFrom a technical standpoint, the bank's analysts warn that the AUD/USD pair appears poised for further downside. They have identified the next critical support level at 0.6420, which coincides with the currency's 200-day moving average.

It retreated to a low of 0.6440, down sharply from the year-to-date high of 0.6705.\nAustralian Jobs Report and US Inflation Data Ahead\nThe AUD/USD exchange rate wavered after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published the latest jobs numbers. This report showed that the country\u2019s inflation rose to a four-year high in September, a sign that more Australians went out to look for work.\nThe numbers showed that the country\u2019s net employment rose by 14,000 in September, confirming the view that the country\u2019s employment growth has slowed sharply this year.\nTherefore, most analysts now expect that the central bank will slash interest rates by 0.25% in the next meeting after it left it unchanged in September. A rate cut would help to stimulate the economy by making it cheaper for companies to borrow.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe AUD/USD pair also reacted to the strong Chinese GDP and manufacturing and industrial production numbers. This growth will likely continue if the US and China reach an agreement and end tensions in the next two weeks.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet with China's premier this week to talk on trade and prepare for the upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit in South Korea.\nThe next key catalyst for the AUD/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will come out on Friday. This will be the only official report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released this month because of the ongoing government shutdown.\nEconomists expect the data to show that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 3.1% in September as the core CPI remained unchanged at 3.1%. A high inflation rate will complicate the Fed\u2019s outlook now that it has made the case for rate cuts.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the AUD/USD pair has pulled back in the past few weeks, moving from a high of 0.6705 on September 17 to a low of 0.6440 on Friday.\nThe pair has remained below the important support level at 0.6526, the lowest swing on September 25. It has moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\nThe pair is also forming a bearish flag pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues falling as traders target the next key support level at 0.6375, its lowest point on June 22.\nReady to trade our free Forex signals?

The pair ticks up as the Japanese Yen (JPY) faces selling pressure, following hopes that Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Innovation Party will form a coalition government, which will pave the way for Sanae Takaichi to become Japan's first female Prime Minister.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the weakest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nSuch a scenario is unfavorable for the Japanese Yen as Takaichi is expected to announce big spending plans to stimulate the economy, a move that would restrict the Bank of Japan (BoE) from continuing on its policy-normalization path.\nTakaichi has emerged as the supporter of former Premier Shinzo Abe's economic policies, which favored big spending and monetary stimulus to boost the economy.\nFor more cues on Japan\u2019s interest rate outlook, investors will focus on the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy announcement on October 30, in which the central bank is expected to hold borrowing rates steady at 0.5%.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) trades marginally higher on improving trade relations between the United States (US) and China. Trade frictions between the nations eased after President Donald Trump signaled on Friday that an additional 100% tariffs imposed on China won\u2019t last long.\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, edges higher to near 98.60.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rat"

                "body": "Technical Structure Shows 150.00 as Crucial Support Zone\nFrom a technical perspective, USD/JPY continues to respect the 150.00 level as a critical support line, with repeated tests failing to produce sustained breakdowns. The 200-day moving average near 147.90, coinciding with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2021\u20132024 rally, remains an untested safety net for bulls. As long as the pair holds above 148.00, the broader trend remains upward.\nThe short-term setup suggests consolidation between 150.00 and 152.00, with breakout potential toward the October 10 high at 153.27 if political stability solidifies and the BoJ refrains from hawkish surprises. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish, with RSI hovering around 55 and the MACD histogram showing positive divergence for the first time since early October. A sustained move above 151.50 could confirm renewed bullish acceleration.\nMarket Positioning Reflects Persistent Yen Bearishness\nCFTC data shows that speculative yen shorts increased by 6% week-over-week, reversing the modest covering seen earlier in the month. Institutional traders have been rebuilding long USD/JPY exposure, anticipating policy divergence to persist into 2026. Japanese exporters, meanwhile, have stepped up hedging activity near 151\u2013152, partially capping upside momentum but confirming expectations of a weaker yen in the medium term.\nForeign investment inflows also remain tilted toward U.S. assets. Japanese pension funds and insurers have expanded their Treasury holdings as yields remain attractive, while domestic returns remain suppressed. This dynamic reinforces a structural weakness in the yen that may persist until the BoJ adopts a meaningfully restrictive stance.\nPolitical and Economic Interplay Keeps the Yen Under Pressure\nThe yen\u2019s trajectory cannot be detached from Japan\u2019s political calculus. Takaichi\u2019s alliance with the Japan Innovation Party ensures parliamentary support for policies aligned with fiscal expansion. That alliance, expected to be ratified by the Diet this week, essentially secures continuity in the government\u2019s pro-growth agenda. This combination of political certainty and monetary accommodation diminishes safe-haven demand for the yen, especially as global risk sentiment improves.\nMarket observers believe the BoJ\u2019s October 30 policy statement could clarify whether the bank intends to tolerate a temporary inflation overshoot or begin normalizing via yield-curve adjustments. If Ueda signals patience, USD/JPY could test the 152\u2013153 range, with traders viewing 153.27 as the next resistance to breach. Conversely, even subtle hawkish language or intervention hints could trigger a sharp short-term pullback toward 149.50\u2013149.00, though strong demand for dollars is expected to limit deeper declines.\nExternal Risks: U.S. Fiscal Drama and Global Trade Factors\nDevelopments in Washington also loom large over USD/JPY dynamics. The U.S. government shutdown standoff threatens to delay key economic releases, complicating the Fed\u2019s decision-making. Should the impasse extend beyond October, investors may rotate into safe-haven assets, potentially strengthening the yen temporarily. However, most analysts expect a short-lived effect, as Japan\u2019s yield disadvantage and BoJ policy inertia remain dominant forces.\nIn the broader context, U.S.-China relations are showing tentative improvement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s talks with Vice Premier He Lifeng eased concerns about a full-blown trade war. Any sustained thaw would benefit global risk assets and likely bolster the dollar, given the U.S. economy\u2019s comparative strength.\nEconomic Data Outlook and Volatility Catalysts\nTraders now await Japan\u2019s upcoming inflation, wage, and unemployment figures, which will shape expectations for BoJ normalization. Inflation persistence near 3%, combined with subdued wage growth, would reaffirm dovish bias. In the U.S., the next CPI and PPI releases, coupled with housing and labor market data, could influence ra"

                "body": "Meanwhile Expectations For Yen Appreciation\nThe ongoing US government shutdown has reached its 20th day, and this political stalemate might limit USD/JPY gains. Spot prices have risen, with technical indicators suggesting a possible further appreciation towards the 151.75 mark, with key resistance levels in focus. However, immediate support stands at the 150.50-150.45 region, with a breach possibly opening the way to recent lows. The Yen\u2019s value is tied to Japan\u2019s economic performance and BoJ policy, with the Yen seen as a safe-haven asset in turbulent times.\nThe BoJ\u2019s monetary policy has been ultra-loose from 2013 to 2024, resulting in Yen depreciation. Recently, the BoJ\u2019s policy adjustments, alongside other central banks\u2019 rate cuts, have supported the Yen. Over the past decade, the BoJ\u2019s policy divergence with other banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, widened bond yield differentials, benefiting the USD. The BoJ\u2019s 2024 decision to shift from ultra-loose policies, combined with rate cuts elsewhere, is narrowing this gap. The Yen\u2019s safe-haven status attracts investors during market stress, boosting its value against riskier currencies.\nBank Of Japan\u2019s Position\nWith the new LDP-JIP coalition in Japan signaling big spending under Prime Minister Takaichi, we see significant downside pressure on the Yen. However, this political push for a loose monetary policy is directly at odds with the Bank of Japan\u2019s stated goals. This clash between political ambition and central bank independence is creating a very uncertain environment for the currency in the coming weeks.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s position is supported by strong economic data, which gives them cover to continue tightening policy. We\u2019ve seen Japan\u2019s core inflation stay above the 2% target for over three years, with the September 2025 figures coming in at a firm 2.8%. Given that the economy also expanded for a fifth straight quarter through June 2025, the BoJ has every reason to proceed with another rate hike soon, which would strengthen the Yen.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US Dollar is looking weak. As of this morning, the CME FedWatch Tool is pricing in an almost certain 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with another expected in December. The ongoing US government shutdown, now dragging into its fourth week, is also weighing on the dollar, just as we saw during the prolonged shutdown back in late 2018.\nThis deep uncertainty between Japan\u2019s political direction and its central bank\u2019s path, combined with clear US Dollar weakness, suggests that volatility is the main trade. A simple bet on the direction of USD/JPY is risky when such powerful forces are pulling it in opposite directions. For derivative traders, this environment makes strategies that profit from price movement itself, regardless of direction, particularly attractive.\nOne effective approach would be to buy volatility using a long straddle, which involves buying both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy would pay off if the USD/JPY pair makes a sharp move either above the 152.00 resistance or breaks below the key 150.00 support level. The cost of the strategy is the premium paid, which is the maximum potential loss if the pair remains stagnant."

However, the report noted that \u201cfirms\u2019 outlooks and intentions remain subdued.\u201d Uncertainty remains elevated, cost pressures have increased for a second consecutive quarter, and sales expectations over the next 12 months contracted for the first time in 10 months to -2.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: Statistics Canada, BOC, LSEG\nInflation in Focus Ahead of Next Week\u2019s Bank of Canada Decision\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) will announce its next interest rate decision on October 29, making today\u2019s inflation report a key event for Canadian dollar traders. Despite inflation falling within the BoC\u2019s 1\u20133% target band earlier this year, core measures have since trended higher, with the weighted median exceeding the upper range three times since April and the trimmed mean twice.\nStill, with a slowing economy and weaker business sentiment, there\u2019s optimism that inflation could ease \u2014 though tariff risks from a revived Trump agenda remain a wild card. The 1-month OIS currently implies a 48% chance of a 25bp rate cut to 2.25%, while the 6-month OIS has fully priced in a 25bp cut.\nBoC Governor Tiff Macklem recently emphasised the need to focus on \u201cthe risks\u201d surrounding the next policy move, citing persistent uncertainty and urging humility in forecasts. GDP is expected to recover modestly after contracting 1.6% in Q2, but a strong rebound is unlikely in the near term.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nUSD/CAD Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Canadian Dollar\nThe US dollar (USD) reached a six-month high against the Canadian dollar (CAD) last week, although bullish momentum is starting to fade on the weekly chart, with a bearish hammer forming just above the 1.40 handle. That said, the daily chart remains within an established uptrend, even if short-term momentum is beginning to soften.\nThe 1.40\u20131.4010 area, marked by the monthly R1 pivot, appears to be a key inflection zone for both bulls and bears. If the 1.40 support level holds, bulls could target a move toward 1.41, near the monthly R2 pivot (1.4105). However, a break below 1.40 would expose downside potential toward the 1.3948 high-volume node (HVN) and the 20-day EMA.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/CAD\nGBP/CAD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs Canadian Dollar\nThe British pound (GBP) has gained around 35% against the Canadian dollar (CAD) since the September 2022 low, maintaining a strong uptrend on the weekly chart. The broader bias remains bullish unless the UK delivers another disappointing Autumn Budget. A series of higher lows on GBP/CAD in recent weeks, supported by the 20-week EMA, underline steady upside momentum \u2014 though the daily chart hints at potential short-term pullbacks.\nOn the daily timeframe, a two-bar bearish reversal pattern (dark cloud cover) has appeared near the monthly R1 pivot and 1.89 handle.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) softens against the US Dollar (USD) on a decline in crude oil prices. The Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for September will be the highlight later on Tuesday. Also, the Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to speak.\nCrude oil price declines to a five-month low as supply glut fears mount, which undermine the commodity-linked Loonie and create a tailwind for the pair. It\u2019s worth noting that Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US, and lower crude oil prices tend to have a negative impact on the CAD value.\nMeanwhile, US-China trade tensions ease after US President Donald Trump said on Friday that 100% tariffs on China are unsustainable and he still plans to meet China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. Investors will closely monitor further updates on US-China trade talks. Any signs of de-escalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies could lift the Greenback against the CAD in the near term.\nHowever, the US federal government shutdown has entered its fourth week with no clear end in sight, marking the third-longest funding lapse in modern history. The GOP-backed bill failed to pass the Senate for the 11th time on Monday. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines. Concerns that the extended US government shutdown could impact economic activity could drag the USD lower.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadia"

Last Tuesday, the currency hit its weakest level since April 10 at 1.4079.\nCanadian firms feel conditions are slightly better than earlier in the year, but they are unlikely to boost investments or hiring given the dampening effect of U.S. tariffs, a Bank of Canada survey for the third quarter showed. The business outlook indicator, a summary of business activity, prices and costs, and capacity, rose to -2.28 from -2.40 in the previous quarter.\n\u201cThe Bank of Canada\u2019s business and consumer surveys continued to paint a downbeat picture of the economy, with only marginal improvement in some indicators relative to the prior quarter,\u201d Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.\n\u201cAnd with the surveys also suggesting that inflation expectations are relatively well contained, today\u2019s data provides further support for another 25-bp [basis point] rate cut from the Bank of Canada next week.\u201d\nCanada\u2019s consumer price index report for September, due on Tuesday, could offer further clues on rate-cut prospects.

Last month, the central bank lowered its benchmark rate to a three-year low of 2.50 per cent. The price of oil was trading 1 per cent lower at US$56.97 a barrel on worries about a supply glut.\nCanadian bond yields moved lower across the curve.

Spot prices, however, remain confined in a familiar range held over the past week or so, warranting caution before positioning for an extension of the recent bounce from last Friday's swing low, around the 200.65 region.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) extends its steady intraday descent after lawmakers in the Lower House have voted for Sanae Takaichi to become Japan's first female Prime Minister. Investors have been speculating that Takaichi would announce more expansionary policy in Japan., which could allow the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to further delay raising interest rates . This, in turn, is seen weighing on the JPY and acting as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross.\nThat said, Takaichi would still need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation as the fragile new coalition remains short of the 233 needed for a simple majority. Moreover, investors seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path as inflation in Japan remains at or above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years, and the economy registered growth for a fifth straight quarter through June.\nThe relatively hawkish BoJ expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to bets that the Bank of England (BoE) could continue cutting rates gradually. Adding to this, worries about the UK\u2019s fiscal outlook ahead of the crucial Autumn budget in November might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the British Pound (GBP). This, in turn, could keep a lid on any maeningful appreciation for the GBP/JPY cross.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in an"

                "body": "Jakarta, Pintu News \u2013 For more than a decade, crypto investors have believed that the price of Bitcoin follows a four-year halving cycle. But now, that pattern seems to be breaking down. Despite record-high flows into spot ETFs and major corporations adding to their Bitcoin reserves, price movements no longer align with the old theory.\nAccording to on-chain analyst James Check, Co-Founder of Checkonchain Analytics, the market is now driven by global liquidity, institutional investment flows, and derivatives growth, no longer by supply reduction from halving. \u201cBitcoin is now responding to the world, not the other way around,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the traditional crypto cycle has now shifted to a new liquidity regime.\nAs of September 2025, CoinShares recorded $1.9 billion in crypto ETF inflows, with almost half of that coming from Bitcoin. While this figure shows tremendous interest, James thinks most of this fund flow is not new money, but rather a rotation from older products like GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) to newer, more efficient ETFs.\nThe total value of incoming ETF funds has reached around $60 billion (IDR995 trillion), but the market remains consolidated as realized profit-taking from existing investors reaches $30-100 billion per month (IDR497-Rp1,657 trillion). This means that selling pressure from long-term holders is holding back the price increase. \u201cThe demand is huge, but the sell side is also incredibly strong,\u201d James explained.\nPreviously, crypto investors often used exchange inflow to read market signals \u2013 for example, declining Bitcoin flows to exchanges were assumed to be a sign of supply scarcity. But James believes this data is now less valid. \u201cI rarely use exchange data because the coverage is incomplete,\u201d he said, highlighting the difficulty of tracking wallet addresses that are widely spread across platforms.\nInstead, James suggests focusing on the supply of long-term holders (LTH), which now stands at 15.68 million BTC, or about 78.5% of the total circulating supply, and is entirely in profit. This data is more indicative of true scarcity than exchange balances, as it reflects investors\u2019 long-term confidence in Bitcoin.\nWhile mining activity used to be considered the main factor of selling pressure in the market, it is now playing a smaller role. With only 450 BTC issued per day, its influence lags far behind the 10,000-40,000 BTC (Rp166-Rp663 million) that old investors sold or moved during the bull market.\nJames asserts, \u201cHalving has been unimportant, even irrelevant for the last few cycles.\u201d The market is now more influenced by institutional flows, ETFs and corporate treasuries than the daily supply from miners. As such, the old narrative of halving as a trigger for big rallies seems to be obsolete in this post-ETF era.\nCheckonchain found two major turning points in Bitcoin\u2019s history: the 2017 price peak and the 2022-2023 transition, when the asset became more \u201cmature\u201d and started to be treated like a global index. Today, its volatility is decreasing, and its correlation with macro assets like gold and stocks is increasing \u2013 showing that Bitcoin is already part of the global financial structure.\nInstead of focusing on the halving cycle, James suggests monitoring the institutional cost basis and market liquidity. Checkonchain data shows that the Rp1.23-Rp1.32 billion ($75,000-$80,000) zone is now a strong area ofbear market floor formation. According to him, the old Realized Price calculated from all coins, including lost coins like Satoshi\u2019s, is no longer relevant in this modern era.\nIn addition to ETFs, the derivatives market is now a key driver of prices. Products such as options and futures contracts on top of spot ETFs are creating a new layer of liquidity. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT is a successful example, accounting for nearly 90% of the crypto ETF market share in the US since launching an options product in late 2024.\nThe US is now the global center of dominance for crypto ETFs, absorbing almost"

                "body": "London\u2019s Bitcoin ETP Launch Reopens Europe\u2019s Retail Channel\nWhile U.S. markets turned defensive, Europe staged a strategic reopening. On October 20, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year retail ban on crypto exchange-traded notes, paving the way for the first regulated Bitcoin ETPs in the U.K.\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETP, now trading on the London Stock Exchange, allows investors to purchase regulated exposure to Bitcoin for as little as $11 per unit. Structured as a physically backed note with institutional custody, it eliminates direct wallet management risk and aligns with traditional brokerage access. Early trading data showed strong engagement from platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212, while larger brokers like AJ Bell are integrating access gradually.\nThe debut signals the start of a European capital inflow cycle mirroring the U.S. ETF launch in 2024. With BlackRock\u2019s U.S. IBIT already exceeding $85 billion AUM, the London product expands global reach, connecting both institutional and retail demand channels.\nFCA director David Geale described the shift as evidence of \u201cmarket maturity,\u201d noting that controlled ETP frameworks can coexist with strict investor-protection standards. The policy also aligns with the U.K.\u2019s broader ambition to modernize fund tokenization and integrate blockchain custody within regulated finance.\nMacro Liquidity Rotation and the Prospect of $600 Billion in New ETF Capital\nAmid the contrasting regional flows, research from Galaxy Digital projects that the next major growth wave could deliver up to $600 billion in net inflows to Bitcoin ETFs over the coming years. Their analysis highlights that approximately 300,000 U.S. financial advisors manage $30 trillion in client assets. Even a modest 2% allocation to Bitcoin ETFs across this channel would equate to $600 billion \u2014 a figure that would eclipse the global $472 billion gold ETF market and quadruple the current $146 billion AUM in U.S. spot Bitcoin funds.\nLarge wealth platforms are gradually preparing for this transition. Morgan Stanley has already advised clients to allocate up to 4% to digital assets within diversified portfolios, while Vanguard is reportedly evaluating the inclusion of third-party crypto ETFs in its brokerage offering. This marks a structural shift from speculative retail flows toward advisor-driven, compliance-anchored allocations, potentially lowering turnover and price volatility.\nGalaxy\u2019s projections emphasize that these advisory inflows would likely behave more like long-term equity or bond allocations \u2014 slower to move, less reactive to price shocks, and highly additive to market depth. If realized, this institutional bridge could elevate total Bitcoin ETF assets to $500 billion within several years, cementing BTC-USD as a mainstream portfolio component rather than a speculative trade.\nTrading Patterns Indicate Short-Term Profit-Taking, Not Structural Reversal\nDespite the magnitude of last week\u2019s outflows, on-chain metrics suggest that long-term holders remain largely unmoved. Exchange balances have declined modestly, indicating that redemptions were more fund-driven reallocations than retail panic. The average holding period of coins in ETF custodians remains above 130 days, consistent with institutional positioning.\nBitcoin\u2019s $110,000\u2013$112,000 range now serves as a technical equilibrium. Resistance stands near $118,500, while support is well-defined around $103,000. A breakout above the mid-$110Ks could reignite inflows if the next Fed meeting confirms liquidity easing. Conversely, sustained weakness below $100,000 could pressure ETFs into further redemptions as hedging activity accelerates.\nFrom a macro lens, the interplay between tariff policy, bond-yield normalization, and central-bank signaling continues to dictate crypto-asset allocation.

                "body": "Key Points\n- BlackRock shifting from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum (ETH) signals institutional preference for utility-driven assets.\n- ETH\u2019s programmable blockchain offers DeFi and staking yields that BTC lacks.\n- While BTC excels as digital gold, ETH\u2019s practical uses position it as a lower-risk growth play long-term.\n- It sounds nuts, but SoFi is giving new active invest users up to $1k in stock, see for yourself (Sponsor)\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $13.5 trillion under management, has started shifting some crypto allocations from Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) to Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). Recent filings show BlackRock increasing its ETH holdings while trimming BTC exposure in certain funds. This isn\u2019t a one-off; it\u2019s part of a pattern where BlackRock has consistently directed more fresh capital into ETH than BTC over the past year.\nAs a bellwether for institutional money, this move could prompt other big players \u2014 like pension funds and hedge funds \u2014 to pile in, boosting ETH\u2019s price and adoption. But does it make ETH the superior buy right now?\nFollowing the Smart Money Trail\nBlackRock\u2019s actions carry weight because they signal confidence to the broader market. Last month, for example, the asset manager\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (NASDAQ:ETHA) recorded its largest inflows in a month drawing 80,768 ETH, while BlackRock\u2019s total Ethereum reserves represent 1.5% of all ETH currently in circulation.\nThis echoes earlier shifts the asset manager made. In the second quarter, BlackRock funneled $2.3 billion into ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) versus $1.8 billion for BTC equivalents. The pivot occurred as executives cite ETH\u2019s evolving ecosystem as a hedge against BTC\u2019s maturing but stagnant role. With regulatory clarity from the SEC on ETH staking rewards, BlackRock views it as less volatile in downturns \u2014 ETH dropped only 45% in the 2024 correction, versus BTC\u2019s 55%. During the flash crash earlier this month, ETH dropped 12% compared a 14% drop by BTC.\nThis isn\u2019t blind faith. BlackRock\u2019s research arm highlights ETH\u2019s deflationary mechanics post-Merge \u2014 the major update to Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism that switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake \u2014 where transaction burns outpace issuance, potentially driving scarcity. If institutions follow \u2014 and data from CoinShares shows inflows mirroring BlackRock\u2019s trends \u2014 ETH could see a 20% to 30% premium over BTC in the next six months.\nYet, skeptics point out BTC\u2019s \u201cdigital gold\u201d status remains unchallenged, with 70% of corporate treasuries (like Strategy\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSTR)) still favoring it for pure store-of-value plays.\nCore Differences That Matter\nAlthough both are nominally \u201ccryptocurrencies,\u201d at their root, Bitcoin and Ethereum diverge sharply. Launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, BTC was designed as peer-to-peer electronic cash \u2014 a decentralized alternative to fiat. Its fixed 21 million supply cap enforces scarcity, making it akin to gold in a digital wrapper.\nBTC\u2019s blockchain prioritizes security and simplicity: proof-of-work consensus demands massive energy (about 150 terawatt hours annually), but it has never been hacked at the protocol level. Today, BTC dominates with a $2.2 trillion market cap, serving mainly as an inflation hedge. El Salvador\u2019s adoption of BTC as legal tender underscores its sovereign appeal.\nEthereum, born in 2015 under Vitalik Buterin, aims bigger: a programmable platform for decentralized apps (dApps). Its shift to proof-of-stake in 2022 slashed energy use by 99%, addressing BTC\u2019s environmental critiques.\nETH\u2019s native token fuels the network \u2014 paying gas fees for smart contracts that enable everything from lending to gaming. With over 4,000 tokens built on it (such as USDC (CRYPTO:USDC) stablecoin), Ethereum powers about 50% or so of DeFi\u2019s $237 billion total value locked (TVL). BTC, on the other hand, lags in utility, relying on sidechains like Lightning for scalability, which process far fewer transactions daily compared to Ether"

This article should not be regarded as investment advice.\nUS President Trump has declared 100% tariffs on Chinese imports by Nov.1, sending shockwaves across the global ecosystem. The announcement also triggered a record-breaking $19 billion wipeout from the crypto market, with Ethereum, AAVE, and MakerDAO plunging considerably.\nAmid this downturn, savvy adherents are actively seeking out altcoins that offer growth-backed utility, paving the way for the PayDax Protocol (PDP).\nAAVE price weekly losses extend to 15%\nLike many altcoins, AAVE initially capitalized on momentum around Bitcoin\u2019s $125k ATH, soaring over 20% in the first week of October.\nHowever, recent trade tensions have sent the crypto market into heightened volatility, causing AAVE to fall 15% on its 7-day chart. Now, at the time of writing, AAVE trades for $241.\nMakerDAO price witnesses 11% weekly slump\nThe MakerDAO price has left holders in the red zone, after recording an 11% slump over the past week. At the time of writing, MakerDAO trades for $1,418, which also represents an 18% fall on its 30-day chart.\nBearing considerable losses, many MakerDAO and AAVE holders now fix their gaze on a hot new Ethereum DeFi altcoin by the name of PayDax Protocol (PDP). As the people\u2019s DeFi bank, PayDax successfully merges lending, insurance, and rewards products on-chain, allowing users to cut out bank fees while earning greater rewards on their deposits.\nPayDax Protocol (PDP): Get Liquidity Without Selling Your Assets\nPayDax Protocol (PDP) is is the model of the modern, decentralized bank, allowing users to get USDT loans by collateralizing cryptos or Real-World Assets (RWAs).\nInstead of selling these holdings and incurring taxes or missing out on future gains, users can find lenders on PayDax\u2019s P2P ecosystem, tokenize their RWA, and receive up to 97% of their RWA\u2019s value as a loan. This utility bridges the vast market of global assets into the DeFi space.\nSuperior Lending and Staking Rewards\nUnlike traditional banks which gatekeep loans and return sub-zero interest on customer deposits, PayDax Protocol (PDP) allows users to negotiate interest rates on their own terms.\nNow, users who provide liquidity currently earn up to 15.2% Annual Yields, which drastically outperform the expected returns on a regular savings account. Meanwhile, advanced stakers earn over 41% gains using yield farming strategies.\nIn addition, PayDax guarantees the highest level of security for lenders through an insurance initiative called the Redemption Pool. Users who stake funds earn an APY of 20% by protecting the system against potential borrower defaults.\nGrowth Backed by Robust Infrastructure and DeFi Utility\nPayDax Protocol (PDP) collaborates with Sotheby\u2019s and Brinks to provide end-to-end security for user RWAs. Furthermore, the team has undergone extensive KYC verification from Assure DeFi, so users can rest assured that all executives are accountable.\nThese factors, combined with the projected growth of RWA tokenization by 2040, are highlighting PayDax\u2019s ongoing presale. At the low entry of $0.015, PDP offers the chance to enter a potential blue-chip token early.\nJoin the PayDax Protocol (PDP) presale Today.\nJoin Paydax Protocol (PDP) presale | Website | Whitepaper | X (Twitter)\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

This latest system brings faster execution, lower fees, and stronger protection for decentralized traders on the Solana blockchain. Jupiter confirmed that Ultra V3 improves both platform performance and the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem.\nSolana DeFi Upgraded With Ultra V3 Tools\nThe upgrade includes three main innovations: Iris Router, ShadowLane, and Predictive Execution, designed to eliminate inefficiencies in Solana DeFi. These tools help reduce slippage, enhance trade precision, and significantly lower transaction failure risks. Jupiter states this new engine provides an unmatched execution environment for decentralized trades.\nSiong, cofounder of Jupiter, emphasized accurate quoting: \u201cUltra V3\u2019s Predictive Execution gives you what you actually get at execution, not what looked good at quotation.\u201d This system guarantees that users receive exact trade amounts, matching quoted and executed prices. Such precision makes Solana DeFi trading more reliable and consistent for users.\nSecurity and Fee Reduction Drive Adoption\nJupiter claims Ultra V3 offers 34 times more protection against sandwich attacks than previous systems. These attacks, common in DeFi, exploit transaction timing to increase slippage and harm users. With stronger defenses, Solana DeFi becomes a safer space for everyday traders and institutions alike.\nThe upgrade also slashes execution fees by 8x to 10x compared to similar platforms. Additionally, Jupiter introduced support for positive slippage gains, delivering 0.6 basis points on most trades. These savings and gains are expected to drive higher activity across the Solana DeFi market.\nJupiter now supports trades as low as $10, expanding access to retail users in the Solana DeFi sector. The update also extends gasless transactions, removing a key barrier for small traders. This makes Solana DeFi more accessible to a broader user base."

Chinese third-quarter GDP, industrial production and retail-sales figures exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts, supporting broader Asian equities.\nThe Nikkei 225 reached a record high, rising 3.37 per cent on the day and registering a year-to-date gain of 24 per cent on hopes of policy stimulus.\nChinese macro data surprised on the upside: Q3 GDP, industrial production and retail sales all beat consensus.\nAn extended AWS outage disrupted the operations of many global companies, underscoring dependence on major cloud providers.\nThe United States and Australia announced a critical-minerals and rare-earths agreement worth around US$8.5 billion to strengthen supply chains.\nNikkei at record highs amid stronger Chinese data and stimulus expectations\nThe robust economic performance in China has underpinned gains across Asian markets, including Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index. Investors are showing confidence in the resilience of the Chinese economy, maintaining positive expectations despite a global economic backdrop in which the United States continues to pursue coercive trade negotiations with other countries, including China.\nPolitical developments in Japan were a further catalyst. Market participants have interpreted the rising prominence of Sanae Takaichi within the Liberal Democratic Party as increasing the probability of a pro-stimulus policy stance should she attain the premiership. Investors commonly view such a stance as positive for equity markets and negative for the yen.\nThe Nikkei 225 closed up 3.37 per cent at 49,185 points \u2014 a record high \u2014 while the yen weakened modestly, trading near \u00a5150.70 to the US dollar. The index\u2019s year-to-date performance stands at approximately 24 per cent.\nFigure 1. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Index (1950-2025). Source: Figure obtained from TradingView.\nChinese economic data beat forecasts\nData from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics showed industrial production accelerating to 6.5 per cent year-on-year, ahead of the prior 5.2 per cent reading. Retail sales rose 3.0 per cent year-on-year, slightly above consensus, and third-quarter GDP expanded by 1.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter, marginally higher than forecasts and the previous quarter\u2019s 1.0 per cent. (See Figure 2.)\nWhile the upside surprises provided reassurance after a period of weak domestic consumption and subdued consumer confidence, commentators noted that a broad-based recovery has not yet been fully established. Market participants nonetheless remain attentive to potential additional stimulus from the People\u2019s Bank of China and fiscal authorities, which could reinforce the recovery.\nChinese equity indices responded modestly to the data: the CSI 300 rose 0.53 per cent to 4,538, the Hang Seng gained 1.42 per cent to 26,232, and the FTSE China A50 advanced 0.37 per cent to 15,043.\nFigure 2.

Amazon later reported the issue resolved, but the incident affected high-profile firms including United Airlines, Robinhood, Reddit, Snapchat, The New York Times, McDonald\u2019s and Disney, and also disrupted certain government sites.\nFor technology and operations specialists, the episode underscored the systemic risk associated with high concentrations of critical infrastructure in a small number of cloud providers. Despite the operational impact, Amazon\u2019s share price rose 1.61 per cent to US$216.48 on the day, suggesting investor confidence in the company\u2019s longer-term fundamentals.\nUS\u2013Australia critical-minerals agreement\nThe United State"
