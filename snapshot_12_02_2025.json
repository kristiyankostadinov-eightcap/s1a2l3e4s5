That helps explain why the metal recently climbed to a six-week peak, before easing back as some traders took money off the table. Futures markets tracked by CME\u2019s FedWatch tool now put the odds of a Fed rate trim next month at close to 90%, so every new data release is under the microscope. This week\u2019s key numbers include November\u2019s ADP employment report on Wednesday and the delayed September Personal Consumption Expenditures index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2013 on Friday. On top of that, comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later today and next week\u2019s policy decision could confirm whether this easing path is taking shape, while ongoing chatter about who might be the next Fed chair adds extra uncertainty for markets already grappling with higher Treasury yields, softer stocks, and manufacturing data still bruised by tariffs.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate-cut hopes keep safe havens in play.\nGold\u2019s pullback comes even as demand holds up: holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold-backed ETF, rose 0.44% on Monday to 1,050.01 metric tons from 1,045.43 tons on Friday. That suggests big investors are still hedging against the risk that growth slows while inflation stays stubborn, even with a potential rate cut on the cards. Other precious metals painted a mixed picture, with silver, platinum, and palladium each moving in different directions and signaling there\u2019s no single narrative driving the whole complex. At the same time, stock markets are wrestling with higher Treasury yields and weak manufacturing data linked to tariffs \u2013 a combo that tends to squeeze cyclical sectors and push some cash toward defensive and haven-style assets. And with a December cut already largely priced in, any upside surprise in jobs or PCE inflation could jolt bond yields and trigger another rapid reshuffle between stocks, gold, and cash.\nThe bigger picture: Global data lines up behind the Fed\u2019s next move.\nThe Fed might be center stage, but investors are also scanning Europe and the UK to see how broad the slowdown really is. Tuesday\u2019s UK Nationwide house price data will offer a window into how higher mortgage costs are hitting the property market. Then the euro area\u2019s flash November HICP inflation figures and October unemployment rate will show whether price pressures are cooling while job markets start to soften. If European inflation drifts lower and jobless figures edge up, that would back the view that major central banks are at or near peak rates and slowly pivoting toward easier policy. A more coordinated global shift in that direction could underpin longer-term demand for gold and other perceived safe havens, even if prices take a breather after their latest run higher.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nTheodora Lee Joseph, CFA \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold strengthens as markets price in December Fed rate cut and Dollar slips\n- Gold climbs to a six-week high as risk-off sentiment boosts safe-haven demand.\n- US Dollar weakens toward two-week lows, offering additional support to XAU/USD.\n- Technical setup stays bullish after breakout above the symmetrical triangle pattern.\nGold (XAU/USD) kicks off the new month on a firm footing, climbing to its highest level since October 21 on Monday, as risk-off sentiment underpins safe-haven demand, while traders gear up for another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) at its December 9-10 monetary policy meeting.\nAt the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading around $4,260, putting the metal on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Prices are up nearly 60% so far this year, supported by strong central bank demand, robust ETF inflows, persistent geopolitical tensions and the prospect of lower interest rates in the United States (US).\nInvestors now turn their attention to key US economic data releases this week, which could influence interest rate cut expectations. Markets are already pricing in around an 87% probability of a 25-basis-point (bps) reduction at next week\u2019s meeting, following dovish-leaning remarks from several policymakers and softer US data last week.\nMarket movers: Risk-off mood, Fed outlook steer markets\n- A dovish Fed outlook continues to weigh on the US Dollar (USD), offering further upside for Gold by making the metal more affordable for overseas buyers. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, is trading around 99.09, hovering near two-week lows.\n- Global equities came under pressure on Monday as risk aversion gripped markets at the start of December. In the US, investors turned cautious ahead of key economic data and the December 9-10 Fed meeting. Asian markets, particularly Japan, were weighed down by hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda. In China, the RatingDog General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 49.9 in November, its lowest level since July, adding to the cautious tone. Meanwhile, a selloff in cryptocurrencies also contributed to the broader risk-off environment.\n- Markets are also watching a possible Fed leadership change after US President Donald Trump said on Sunday, \u201cI know who I am going to pick, yeah. We\u2019ll be announcing it.\u201d Reports indicate Kevin Hassett is the leading candidate to replace Jerome Powell, fuelling expectations of a more dovish policy path given his prior advocacy for interest-rate cuts.\n- On the geopolitical front, attention is on Russia-Ukraine peace talks after four-hour negotiations concluded in Florida over the weekend. US and Ukrainian officials described the session as \u201cdifficult but productive.\u201d The US negotiator, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Moscow today for follow-up talks and could meet President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n- The US economic calendar features the ISM Manufacturing PMI later on Monday, with consensus expecting the index to hold in contraction territory at 48.6 compared with 48.7 in October. In the week ahead, the spotlight shifts to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report due on Friday.\nTechnical analysis: XAU/USD maintains bullish bias after triangle breakout\nOn the 4-hour chart, Gold has confirmed a successful breakout above a well-defined symmetrical triangle pattern, signalling a bullish continuation structure. The breakout shows improving momentum, although follow-through buying remains limited for now as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) holds in overbought territory near 77.\nThis is keeping prices somewhat capped, with XAU/USD oscillating inside the previous supply zone between $4,250 and $4,270. A clean move above this zone would strengthen bullish conviction and open the door for a retest of the all-time high near $4,381.\nOn the downside, initial support is aligned at the 21-period Simple Moving Aver"

Brent crude stands just below $63 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is around $59.\nThat low-ish price led OPEC and its allies to decide over the weekend to hold the amount of oil they supply to global markets steady for the next few months. OPEC+ countries have been trying to boost oil production for a few years now, but the laws of supply and demand have made that tricky.\nThere\u2019s been this tug-of-war between some members of OPEC+, said Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University: \u201cDo they want to have higher prices and higher revenues, or do they want to claim market share as the world's low cost suppliers?\u201d\nThe chasing-market-share side won out for a while, and OPEC countries pumped more oil. But it\u2019s hard to keep that up when prices are as low as they are.\nAnd prices are low in part because the market\u2019s gotten crowded. For one, there\u2019s the U.S., which produced a record amount of crude in September. Hugh Daigle, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that\u2019s partly because U.S. oil producers have gotten more efficient.\n\u201cAs it stands right now, most basins here in the U.S. are still profitable,\u201d he said, even at $60 or so a barrel.\nBut it's not just the U.S. boosting supply, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at data firm Kpler.\n\u201cWe have Brazil hitting record production. We have Canada also showing increasing output. You have Norway increasing production,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s also new offshore drilling elsewhere in South America. A lot of this new output was planned years ago, but it takes a while to get a new oil rig going.\n\u201cIt's like London buses. They\u2019ll all come along at the same time,\u201d Smith said.\nAnd that\u2019s the challenge for OPEC.\n\u201cIt's not just one player that they're having to deal with here, but it's a number of them all increasing, getting up to record production at the same time,\u201d Smith said.\nAll of that supply is hitting kind of tepid demand, said Clark Williams-Derry at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nThe global economy is a bit shaky. And, especially in Europe and Asia, \u201celectric vehicles are starting to bite into gasoline demand, into diesel demand,\u201d Williams-Derry said. That\u2019s pushing down the price of crude.\nFor the rest of us who don\u2019t drive EVs, that means lower gas prices. The U.S. average is now under $3 a gallon."

The incident raised the possibility of further curbs to Russian supply, particularly after the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which moves more than 1% of global oil, halted operations last weekend when a mooring at its Black Sea terminal was damaged in a separate Ukrainian drone attack.\nOil prices have come under sustained pressure in recent months, logging a fourth consecutive monthly decline in November after the International Energy Agency projected a record surplus in 2026. Brent crude is down 15% so far this year.\nStephen Innes, at SPI Asset Management, said the OPEC+ announcement \u201cmarks a subtle but important shift: after releasing roughly 2.9 million barrels per day back into the market since April 2025, the coalition has decided that regaining market share is less urgent than preserving what\u2019s left of the price floor\u201d.\nJim Reid, analyst at Deutsche Bank, added that the market remained restrained as traders grew \u201ccautious on the prospects of a possible peace deal in Ukraine\u201d.\n(BZ=F)\nGold (GC=F)\nGold prices climbed on Monday to their highest level in five weeks, buoyed by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.\nGold futures climbed 0.8% to $4,286.80 per ounce, while spot gold advanced by the same margin to $4,254.23 an ounce at the time of writing."

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) had to suspend loadings at its terminals after one of the moorings was damaged by Ukrainian attacks. The CPC terminal is located at Novorossiysk port in Russia, predominantly shipping Kazakhstan crude oil. It\u2019s been on the receiving end of several attacks recently. The latest incident saw Kazakhstan activate a plan to redirect exports. Shipments from the CPC terminal have averaged around 1.48m b/d so far this year, up roughly 200k b/d from last year, as the expansion of the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan supported exports.\nAdding support to the market is increasing supply risks for Venezuelan crude oil after President Trump said he's considering closing the airspace over the nation. This escalation between the US and Venezuela has the US carrying out strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs, while also building its military presence nearby. Venezuela exports around 800k b/d, of which most of the crude oil will head to China. Clearly, any further escalation puts this supply at risk.\nOPEC+ met over the weekend. The group stuck to its policy of keeping output steady over the first quarter of next year \u201cdue to seasonality\u201d. This was largely expected. Meanwhile, the group will review the maximum sustainable production capacity of members, which will serve as a reference for 2027 production baselines. This could certainly lead to disagreement among members, with countries keen to secure higher baselines.\nThe latest positioning data shows that speculators cut their net long in ICE Brent by 57,430 lots over the last reporting week to 120,934 lots. The move was predominantly driven by fresh shorts entering the market, with the gross short growing by 39,404 lots week-on-week. Speculators also cut their net long in ICE gasoil for the first time since late October, reducing positions by 20,043 lots to a net long of 82,152 lots. Speculative selling in both crude and gasoil is likely driven by Russia-Ukraine peace plan talks.\nMetals \u2013 Copper hits record high\nCopper surged to a record high on Friday amid a volatile trading session after an hours-long halt on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange disrupted markets.\nThe renewed bullish momentum in copper follows an upbeat CESCO Week event in Shanghai, which reinforced expectations of tighter supply. Copper\u2019s rally this year has been fuelled by mine disruptions and distortions to trade flows amid Trump\u2019s tariffs. Copper is up around 27% this year.\nAlso, major copper smelters in China pledged to jointly cut intake of copper concentrate as falling processing fees squeezed margins. The China Copper Smelters Purchasing Team (CSPT), a group of 13 major smelters, will cut concentrate processing rates by more than 10% next year, according to Bloomberg.\nChina\u2019s copper smelters posted a succession of record production figures this year despite a tightening feedstock market and the government\u2019s campaign against industrial overcapacity and excessive competition. China\u2019s refined copper output has been strong despite low treatment and refining charges (TC/RC). These fees earned by smelters for processing ore into metal have plunged to record lows due to a shortage of raw materials amid rapid growth in China\u2019s smelting capacity. Spot charges have fallen as low as minus $60/t this year. Although similar pledges were made last year, they didn\u2019t result in significant reductions in refined copper output. This year, China has produced almost 10% more refined copper through October.\nAgriculture \u2013 Smaller g"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Extends Rally To 1.1630 As Fed Dovish Turn Lifts Euro\nThe euro strengthens for a sixth session against the dollar, stabilizing near 1.1630 as markets price in a December Fed rate cut while Eurozone CPI and PMI data support the pair\u2019s momentum | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast - Gains Momentum As Fed Easing Bets Intensify\nThe EUR/USD pair advanced for a sixth straight session, holding near 1.1630, its highest since mid-November. The rally stems from rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut in December. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped below 99.50, and Treasury yields retreated, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.02%. This dovish shift has weakened the greenback, giving the euro room to extend its recovery even amid subdued U.S. data. The upcoming ISM Manufacturing PMI, projected at 48.6 versus 48.7 in October, remains a key trigger. If it misses expectations, dollar selling could accelerate, pushing EUR/USD toward 1.1655-1.1670.\nEurozone Inflation Stability Supports Euro Strength\nEurozone consumer prices held steady, providing a solid foundation for the euro. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) reached 2.2% year-over-year, with core inflation climbing to 2.5%. France\u2019s CPI remained stable at 0.8%, while Spain\u2019s inflation slipped to 3.1%, and Germany\u2019s regional data stayed around 2.3%. Despite a contraction in the Manufacturing PMI to 49.6, retail sales rose 0.3% month-on-month, signaling a mild rebound in consumption. The European Central Bank (ECB) remains cautious but firm on holding rates steady. Policymakers are not signaling any urgent tightening, reflecting confidence in moderating inflation despite mixed data.\nTechnical Picture: EUR/USD Approaches Key Resistance Zone\nTechnically, EUR/USD broke above 1.1615 resistance and continues to hold above both its 50-EMA and 200-EMA. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 56 indicates moderate bullish momentum, while the MACD sits above the signal line, showing room for further gains. Key resistance levels stand at 1.1655, 1.1670, and 1.1730, while support lies at 1.1550 and 1.1500. Sustained price action above 1.1600 confirms short-term bullish bias, with scope to target 1.1720-1.1800.\nDollar Weakness Deepens Amid Dovish Fed Rhetoric\nThe U.S. Dollar continues to lose ground as investors reposition ahead of the Fed\u2019s decision. Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s silence during the pre-meeting blackout period has left markets relying on prior dovish signals from members such as John Williams and Austan Goolsbee, both of whom hinted at easing as early as December. The probability of a December rate cut has surged to 87%, with markets pricing at least two additional reductions in 2026. Falling yields and dovish expectations have weighed heavily on the DXY, keeping the euro well-supported across G10 pairs.\nEuro Outperforms As DXY Tests Critical Support\nThe Dollar Index is testing a crucial ascending trendline near 99.35, where prior swing lows and the 50-EMA intersect. The RSI around 40 shows cooling but not exhausted momentum. A clean break below 99.00 would expose 98.56, opening deeper downside potential. Conversely, any rebound toward 99.82-100.38 would likely face selling pressure. The euro gained 0.29% versus USD, 0.24% versus GBP, and 0.31% versus NZD, showing clear strength. Risk aversion in equities and a Bitcoin drop below $90,000 further redirected flows into safer assets like the euro and yen.\nRead More\n-\nBLOX ETF (NYSEARCA:BLOX) Holds 36% Yield at $18.64 \u2014 Oversold Levels Signal Recovery Potential\n01.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs (XRPI, XRPR) Drop Sharply as XRP Slides to $2.04 After 21Shares Launch Delay\n01.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Surges Above $4.80 as Cold Temperatures and Record LNG Exports\n01.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Slips Below 155.00 as BoJ Signals December Rate Hi"

                "body": "US Expectations Impacting Euro\nThe Euro climbed to a two-week high above 1.1630 against the US Dollar. This increase comes despite a contraction in Eurozone manufacturing activity, as the US Dollar weakens on anticipation of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\nUS manufacturing data and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s participation in a panel discussion are key focus areas. The Euro\u2019s rise is supported by the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut by 25 basis points next week.\nUS ISM Manufacturing PMI \u2013 a significant indicator of business activity in the US \u2013 is expected to drop to 48.6 from 48.7. Analysts will closely watch the Prices Paid sub-index and the employment gauge.\nThe Euro strengthens despite weak Eurozone manufacturing data; the final HCOB Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.6 in November. Currency movements show Euro strengthening against the New Zealand Dollar, while the upcoming economic calendar includes Eurozone HICP and US employment data.\nTechnically, EUR/USD breaks through the 1.1615 resistance area, with additional resistance expected at the 1.1660 \u2013 1.1670 zone. Immediate support levels are at 1.1550, with further support anticipated at 1.1500.\nUS Dollar Weakness Drives Trends\nThe US Dollar is clearly on the defensive as the market fully expects a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. This has pushed the EUR/USD to two-week highs, and we see this trend continuing in the near term. The primary driver is not Euro strength but broad-based Dollar weakness.\nConsidering this momentum, we believe buying call options on the EUR/USD is the most direct strategy. A strike price around 1.1650 with an expiration in late January 2026 would allow us to profit from a continued move towards the 1.1730 resistance level. This approach offers a defined risk while capturing the expected upside volatility.\nThe case for a weaker dollar was just strengthened, as the latest ISM Manufacturing PMI for November was released, coming in at 48.1. This figure is below the 48.6 consensus and last month\u2019s 48.7, signaling a faster-than-expected contraction in US factory activity. This disappointing data will likely fuel further bets on the Fed\u2019s upcoming rate cut.\nAll eyes will now turn to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data due out this Friday. The most recent data from October showed Core PCE inflation at 2.8% year-over-year, and we anticipate this week\u2019s print for November will show a further decline to 2.7% or even 2.6%. A soft inflation reading would give the Fed a clear green light to ease monetary policy.\nWe remember a similar dynamic in late 2023 when the dollar weakened considerably as the market began pricing in the end of the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle. The current sentiment feels much the same, as traders are now positioning for a series of cuts extending into 2026. This historical precedent supports the view that the path of least resistance for the dollar is lower.\nIt is important to note that the Euro itself is not showing fundamental strength, with its own manufacturing PMI recently revised down to a five-month low. However, in foreign exchange, everything is relative, and the market is solely focused on the US interest rate story. This makes the long EUR/USD position a clean bet against the dollar.\nWhile our primary view is bullish on EUR/USD, we must watch the upcoming Eurozone inflation data this Tuesday. A surprisingly low Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) could briefly temper the Euro\u2019s rise. Traders could consider buying cheap, out-of-the-money put options as a short-term hedge against any unexpected data from Europe."

                "body": "EUR/USD Forecast: Euro rises for sixth day as Fed rate cut expectations pressure USD\n- EUR/USD rises for the sixth consecutive day, supported by broad US Dollar weakness.\n- Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts continue to drive the recovery in the exchange rate.\n- Investors now turn to US ISM Manufacturing data for additional guidance on monetary policy.\nEUR/USD moves higher at the start of the week and trades around 1.1635 at the time of writing, its highest level in two weeks. The pair is extending a rebound mainly fuelled by persistent softness in the US Dollar (USD), while transatlantic macroeconomic prospects continue to shift in favour of the Euro (EUR).\nThe final November Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the Eurozone, revised slightly lower to 49.6, failed to slow the single currency\u2019s advance. Developments in the United States (US) largely shape the movement, as investors now expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut next week, followed by several more rate cuts in 2026. This broad repricing of interest rate expectations is weighing on US yields and, in turn, on the USD.\nMarkets are also watching political developments in Washington. According to Reuters, US President Donald Trump is considering appointing economist Kevin Hassett, known for his dovish stance, as the next Fed Chair. Such a nomination would reinforce expectations of a much more accommodative policy outlook in the coming quarters, adding further pressure on the US Dollar.\nLater in the day, attention will turn to the release of the November Iinstitute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI, expected to ease slightly to 48.6, still in contraction territory. Key sub-components, particularly the Prices Paid index and the Employment indexes, will be closely monitored as investors assess whether the US slowdown is deepening. A weaker-than-expected print would solidify expectations of an imminent Fed policy pivot.\nLooking ahead, this week brings a dense sequence of macroeconomic catalysts likely to influence EUR/USD. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in the Eurozone on Tuesday, Services PMIs on Wednesday, and the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Prices Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, on Friday. With every data release interpreted through the lens of the upcoming rate-cut cycle, volatility may remain elevated.\nIn this environment, EUR/USD maintains a constructive bias as long as markets remain convinced that the Fed will start easing in December. For now, market dynamics continue to hinge on diverging monetary-policy expectations, and on that front, the balance still leans in favour of the Euro.\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis\nIn the 4-hour chart, EUR/USD trades at 1.1637, up for the day by 30 pips above the opening. The 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) edges higher near 1.1574, with price extending above it to preserve a bullish tone. The rising slope suggests steady buying pressure and keeps the bias supported by the average. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67, reflecting firm momentum approaching overbought territory. A break of the descending trend line from 1.1919 around 1.1595 shifts the technical picture to the upside. Immediate resistance aligns at 1.1656, followed by 1.1728. A move through the first hurdle could expose the latter.\nThe pair holds above a rising trend line from 1.1491, which offers support near 1.1578. The SMA continues to slope upward, and EUR/USD remains above it, keeping the advance intact. RSI stays elevated, consistent with a momentum-led grind higher. Support is seen at 1.1500, then at 1.1469. Holding above 1.1578 would maintain the bullish bias, while a pullback toward the trend-line support would need to be defended to prevent a deeper retracement into the cited support band.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPremium\nYou have reached your limit of 3 free articles for this month.\nStart your subscri"

Chancellor Reeves stands accused of grossly misreprenting the true state of the UK\u2019s finances. Chancellor Reeves has continued to advocate for \u201cunavoidable increases\u201d in budgetary taxes, despite the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) noting recently that the current government is facing an unexpected surplus, rather than the forecast deficit, thanks to stronger-than-expected wage growth and higher-than-expected tax revenues offsetting declines in productivity.\nPrime Minister Kier Starmer\u2019s wobbly government in British Parliament continues to face political headwinds on all fronts, with polling numbers declining steadily and support from within Starmer\u2019s own Labour party dwindling. Political instability is beginning to underpin market flows into (but mostly out of) the Pound Sterling, limiting topside potential for bullish Cable hopefuls.\nFed rate cut odds remain the focal point\nThe possibility of a December interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) remains the key focal point for global markets, and US Dollar traders in particular. Official data remains limited following the longest US government funding closure in history, and the Fed is facing down a notable lack of meaningful labor and inflation metrics heading into its rate call on December 10. ADP Employment Change figures are due on Wednesday, and are expected to show another downturn in new hiring. With a lack of large-scale Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) figures for both October and November, the Fed is faced with the difficult choice of cutting interest rates based on volatile private sector data, or holding off for another month or two while policymakers wait for a jumpstart in data collection and reporting to push fresh economic data to the forefront.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut expectations are spreading into a messy pool heading into the tail end of the year. Rate markets are still pricing in nearly 90% odds of a third straight interest rate cut on December 10. However, rate traders are also pricing in 88% odds that the Fed will hold off in December and deliver a quarter-point rate trim in January.\nGBP/USD price forecast\nGBP/USD price action found a hard wall at the 1.3250 level on Monday, rejecting intraday bids and sending the Cable pair back toward the 1.3200 neighborhood. Converging 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at the 1.3250 region adds significant downward pressure to the chart zone, and a slow Stochastic Oscillator (14,5,5) testing the high side of overbought conditions is teasing that further downside momentum could be on the cards.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

Sterling gained traction after the Autumn Budget presented by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, which introduced higher taxes on corporations and luxury properties. The move, aimed at strengthening public finances and reducing the deficit, boosted short-term investor confidence. The FTSE 100 advanced, UK bond yields dropped, and the pound recovered from a four-week slide.\nFiscal Policy Support Boosts Short-Term Sterling Sentiment\nReeves\u2019 decision to raise taxes on high-value real estate and betting firms\u2014costing companies like Flutter Entertainment over \u00a3500 million annually\u2014was perceived as a stabilizing move for fiscal discipline. The government\u2019s commitment to maintaining a budget buffer and capping borrowing through 2029 reassured investors that the UK remains committed to balancing growth and stability. The market reacted with a modest rally in GBP/USD, which climbed above 1.3200, consolidating around the 50-day EMA.\nU.S. Inflation, PCE Index, and Fed Rate Cut Expectations Drive USD Moves\nThe U.S. dollar has weakened modestly as traders anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in early 2026. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, remains critical for near-term sentiment. Recent U.S. data suggest inflation cooling below 3%, while unemployment stabilizes near 4.2%. With bond yields retreating from 5%, the dollar\u2019s appeal as a yield-based safe haven is fading, adding further pressure on USD across majors, especially GBP/USD and EUR/USD.\nTechnical Outlook: GBP/USD Eyes 1.3350 Resistance While 1.3010 Remains the Line in the Sand\nTechnically, the GBP/USD pair faces immediate resistance at 1.3350, aligned with the 200-day EMA and a descending trendline from the yearly high of 1.3805. Momentum indicators suggest consolidation, with the RSI hovering near 54. The Supertrend indicator has turned red, reflecting growing bearish pressure. If sellers regain control below 1.3150, a slide toward 1.3010 becomes likely\u2014the lowest level in November and a critical retracement point at the 38.2% Fibonacci level. On the upside, a daily close above 1.3350 could trigger acceleration toward 1.35 and potentially 1.37 if Fed easing accelerates.\nEconomic Divergence Between the UK and U.S. Fuels Range Trading\nDespite a stronger fiscal position, the UK economy continues to show uneven growth, with GDP expansion near 1.5% annually and inflation still elevated at 3.6%. The Bank of England remains cautious, maintaining policy rates above 4.75%, limiting domestic credit growth. Across the Atlantic, U.S. economic activity shows resilience, but disinflationary signals strengthen the case for monetary easing. This divergence leaves GBP/USD trapped in a medium-term range, fluctuating between 1.30 and 1.33.\nMarket Positioning and Short-Term Sentiment\nSpeculative positioning in futures data indicates hedge funds trimming dollar longs while increasing moderate pound exposure. The pair\u2019s 3-month implied volatility stands at 7.4%, slightly below the 2024 average, signaling reduced fear of sharp moves. The stabilization in UK bond yields near 4.1% contrasts with falling U.S. yields, narrowing the rate differential and favoring sterling strength over the medium term.\nMacro Events Ahead: PMI and Housing Data Set to Define Direction\nUpcoming data on UK manufacturing and services PMI will clarify whether the recent rebound in business activity is sustainable.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had revised productivity lower, but this was offset by stronger wage growth and healthier tax revenues \u2014 leaving Reeves with a surplus rather than the anticipated funding gap. Despite this, she signalled in pre-budget comments that tax increases were unavoidable.\nThe controversy has emerged at a difficult moment for the government. Both Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are grappling with persistently weak polling numbers and simmering frustration within Labour ranks, fuelling concerns that political tensions could escalate.\nThis undercurrent of instability kept the Pound on the back foot throughout Monday\u2019s session, with traders wary that further volatility may lie ahead.\nThe US Dollar (USD) found its momentum constrained at the start of the week, even as markets leaned towards a risk-off stance, amid rising expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\nSave on Your GBP/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nConfidence in a December cut has grown steadily, with markets now pricing in an 87.6% probability \u2014 up from 84.4% a week ago.

                "body": "USD/JPY Forecast: Currency Pair of the Week | December 1, 2025\nYen rallies as Japanese yields surge\nThe yen has staged an assertive bid at the start of this week, fuelled by further gains in Japanese bond yields amid a hawkish repricing of interest rates in Japan. Among the yen pairs, the USD/JPY was down over 100 pips by the late afternoon London trade, with the pair also weighed down by the general softness observed in US dollar. The mood was quite bearish in the crypto space with stocks also under pressure, amid concerns that the long-running yen-funded carry trade was being unwound. The USD/JPY forecast now looks to be tilted towards the downside as the market finally wakes up to the idea that the era of the one-way yen carry may be running out of steam.\nBoJ December hike appears more likely now\nGiving the bond markets a jolt was Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, who delivered unexpectedly hawkish remarks, sending market pricing for a December hike from less than 15 basis points to 21 bp in a matter of hours. Investors were caught leaning the wrong way, assuming new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi would act as the palace guard for dovish policy. Ueda decisively dispelled that idea, signalling no meaningful political resistance to higher rates and warning that delaying tightening could risk an uncomfortable spike in inflation. As the new filtered through, the Japanese bond market sell-off gathered pace, and that helped to lift both the yen and concerns about the unwinding of the carry trade.\nMarkets hits by unwind the carry trade fears\nWith Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields lurching higher in recent days, this has effectively been pressing the brakes on cheap-yen funding many traders have used to leverage their positions. In other words, we are seeing a bit of a reverse-carry reaction which has rippled across risk assets today, pressuring speculative corners of the market as global investors unwind leveraged bets previously buoyed by rock-bottom Japanese yields.\nUeda laid out the BOJ\u2019s framework with plain intent, stressing that upcoming wage data will be pivotal for December\u2019s policy decision. He argued that a combination of proactive fiscal measures from Tokyo and a recalibration of monetary support from the BOJ should help steer Japan towards sustainable growth. This is a clear pushback against the narrative that Japan would remain parked indefinitely at zero rates.\nThe market\u2019s response has been notable: USD/JPY traded roughly 0.7% lower as the Nikkei futures and JGBs broke down. But it is clear that the pair remains structurally overvalued at these levels. If the reverse-carry trade truly reawakens amid conviction that the BOJ could actually be taken seriously this time, then we could see the USD/JPY tumble back towards the low 150s again in short order.\nWhat about the US dollar?\nThe Fed\u2019s two most decisive data inputs \u2014 CPI and non-farm payrolls \u2014 won\u2019t arrive until after the December rate decision next week. That drastically dilutes this week\u2019s ability to spring any material surprises in as far as rate cut expectations are concerned.\nISM Manufacturing PMI remains in contraction as we just found out today with a print of 48.2, down from 49.0 the month before. On Wednesday, analysts anticipate flat ADP payrolls growth with risks tilting negative. Thursday\u2019s Challenger job cuts could reintroduce softer employment signals, while Friday\u2019s core PCE inflation is expected around 0.2% month-on-month \u2014 mild enough to keep rate-cut conversations alive without much fuss.\nMeanwhile, a new Fed Chair appointment could land in the coming days, with market chatter pointing toward Kevin Hassett, whose dovish inclinations may add an additional layer of pressure on the greenback if confirmed.\nWhere does this all the USD/JPY forecast?\nWhat matters moving forward the most is the evolving rate differential, and risk appetite, more than anything else. Japan is inching towards tightening, while the US remains anchored to easing expectatio"

                "body": "USD/JPY remains on the back foot as positive risk tone counters BoJ rate hike bets\n- The Japanese Yen attracts some sellers as a positive risk tone undermines safe-haven assets.\n- Firming expectations for an imminent BoJ rate hike should help limit deeper losses for the JPY.\n- Dovish Fed bets keep the USD bulls on the defensive and might contribute to capping USD/JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) maintains its offered tone through the Asian session on Tuesday, though the supportive fundamental backdrop warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders. Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled on Monday that a December interest rate increase could be under consideration. This, along with intervention fears, helps limit deeper JPY losses.\nMeanwhile, a generally positive risk tone is seen undermining the JPY's safe-haven status and assisting the USD/JPY pair to build on the overnight bounce from the 154.65 region, or a two-week low. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, struggles to attract any meaningful buyers amid bets for another rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) this month, and caps the upside for spot prices.\nJapanese Yen struggles to lure buyers despite rising BoJ rate hike bets\n- Asian stocks stage a modest recovery after the previous day's selloff, undermining traditional safe-haven assets and prompting some selling around the Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Tuesday. This, along with a modest US Dollar (USD) uptick, assists the USD/JPY pair in building on the overnight bounce from the 154.65 region, or a two-week low.\n- Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda offered the strongest signal yet toward further normalization and said on Monday that the likelihood of the central bank's economic and price projections being met is rising. In fact, inflation in Japan has remained above the central bank\u2019s 2% target for over three years, strengthening the case for policy tightening.\n- Traders were quick to react and are pricing in a roughly 80% chance of a rate hike at the December 18-19 BoJ meeting, up from around 60% last week. The outlook pushed the rate-sensitive two-year Japanese government bond yield to 1% for the first time since June 2008 on Monday, and the 20-year yield to levels not seen since November 2020.\n- Moreover, the 30-year government bond yields climbed to a record peak on Tuesday, and the 10-year yield reached a 17-year high, which, in turn, backs the case for the emergence of some dip-buying around the JPY.\n- Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Sunday that recent erratic swings in the foreign exchange market and rapid JPY weakening are clearly not driven by fundamentals. It\u2019s our position to issue warnings against such matters, Katayama added further, fueling speculations about the government intervention to stem any further JPY weakness.\n- The US Dollar dived to a two-week low on Monday after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.2 in November, down from 48.7 in the previous month. The reading missed consensus estimates and comes on top of the recent tepid US economic data, suggesting that growth in the world's largest economy is cooling.\n- Moreover, dovish signals from Federal Reserve officials fueled speculation for another rate reduction this month. In fact, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates a nearly 88% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s December 9\u201310 meeting. This marks a big divergence in comparison to the BoJ's hawkish outlook and should cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- Heading into next week's Fed rate decision, investors will confront the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index \u2013 the central bank's preferred inflation gauge \u2013 for more cues about the future rate-cut path. The uncertainty, however, remains in the absence of the official jobs report because of the recent federal government shutdown.\nUSD/JPY needs to surpass 156.00 to back the case for additional gains\nThe USD/JPY pair's corrective sli"

The move marks a significant shift in market structure, with carry trade positioning unwinding as Japanese Government Bond yields climb to multi-year highs. Traders are now recalibrating rate expectations on both sides of the Pacific, with the BOJ moving closer to tightening while the Federal Reserve signals easing, intensifying downward pressure on the pair\u2019s trajectory.\nTokyo Inflation Sparks Policy Repricing\nJapan\u2019s latest Tokyo CPI readings reignited expectations for policy normalization. Headline inflation increased 0.3% month-over-month and 2.7% year-over-year, while core inflation, excluding fresh food, advanced 2.8%, surpassing expectations and remaining well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. This reinforced the probability of a December rate hike, now priced at 56%, with odds of a second hike by October 2026 exceeding 80%. Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s remarks confirmed policymakers are prepared to weigh rate increases \u201cproactively,\u201d emphasizing that delayed tightening could trigger unwanted inflation acceleration. The statement immediately lifted short-end yields, with 2-year JGBs touching 1% for the first time since 2008, while 20-year bonds reached their highest levels since 2020.\nCarry Trade Unwind Intensifies Market Volatility\nHigher Japanese yields have reignited the reverse carry trade, pressuring speculative positions that depended on ultra-low yen borrowing costs. As bond yields surged, leveraged traders began cutting positions, sending the yen broadly higher across major pairs. The USD/JPY reaction was swift\u2014falling 0.7% on the day\u2014as risk assets from equities to cryptocurrencies declined simultaneously. Analysts view this as a potential structural unwind of the long-standing carry trade, particularly if the BoJ executes multiple hikes within the next 10 months. The pair\u2019s recent decoupling from U.S.\u2013Japan yield spreads highlights the dominance of positioning flows over fundamentals in short-term moves.\nFed Policy Divergence and U.S. Data Weakness Add Pressure\nWhile the BoJ edges toward tightening, the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance remains distinctly dovish. Markets fully price a 25-basis-point rate cut for the December 9\u201310 meeting, with some traders betting on as much as 100 bps in cumulative easing through 2026. Recent U.S. economic data supports this expectation: the ISM Manufacturing PMI printed at 48.2, its lowest in three months, while the employment index dropped to 44, confirming contraction. A pending leadership change at the Fed, with Kevin Hassett emerging as a potential new chair, adds further downside risk to the dollar given his historically dovish rhetoric. The DXY Index fell below 99.40, its weakest level in two weeks, amplifying the drag on USD/JPY.\nTechnical Breakdown and Key Levels in Focus\nThe technical structure of USD/JPY now shows pronounced deterioration after breaking below the mid-October uptrend. The pair currently consolidates near 155.40, defending minor support at 154.50, while the major support zone lies at 152.69, aligned with the 50-day SMA, and deeper structure support at 150.20, marked by the 100-day SMA. Resistance levels emerge at 156.00 and 157.00, followed by the November swing high of 157.90. Oscillators show momentum fatigue: RSI has slipped to 54, a neutral reading after peaking above 70, and MACD has crossed below the signal line near the zero axis, confirming reduced bullish energy.

                "body": "The USD/CAD pair has extended a streak of four consecutive bearish sessions, accumulating a decline of more than 1% in favor of the Canadian dollar in the short term, which has begun to consolidate a relevant bearish bias. Downward pressure has remained firm following the release of stronger-than-expected quarterly GDP data, reducing the need for the Bank of Canada to continue cutting interest rates in the near term. This firmer outlook for the Canadian economy has strengthened the Canadian dollar, and as long as the market expects a more restrictive Bank of Canada, this could act as a key catalyst for consistent selling pressure on USD/CAD in the coming sessions.\nNew GDP Figures Surprise to the Upside\nThe Canadian economy appears to be gaining more momentum than anticipated. Quarterly GDP data published on November 28 showed growth of 0.6%, well above the previous reading of -0.5%, and on an annualized basis the economy expanded 2.6%, far exceeding the 0.5% expected. These results have shifted expectations for the Bank of Canada, whose decision to maintain low rates had been based on fears of a potential economic slowdown \u2014 something the latest GDP data does not currently indicate.\nWith this new backdrop, the Bank of Canada now has less need to continue lowering rates in the short term. In fact, the recent data points toward stronger economic activity, which could translate into upward inflationary pressures in the medium term. This may lead the central bank to maintain a more neutral stance at the 2.25% policy rate for its final decision of the year on December 10, contrasting with its more dovish behavior in recent months.\nThis shift is already reflected in market probabilities, which now assign a 94% chance that the current 2.25% rate will remain unchanged in December, signaling a slightly more aggressive Bank of Canada toward year-end.\nSource: bankofcanadaodds\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the market expects the Federal Reserve to maintain a lower-rate policy, with expectations that the current 4.00% rate will fall to 3.75% in the December decision. This difference between a potentially more restrictive Bank of Canada and a more dovish Fed could begin to reduce the relative attractiveness of the U.S. dollar while strengthening Canadian-dollar-denominated investments, especially as the rate differential in favor of the United States continues to narrow. This is already reflected in the behavior of the DXY index, which tracks the strength of the U.S. dollar against other assets and has posted significant declines, now sitting near 99 points, below the psychological 100-point level. This movement confirms persistent short-term dollar weakness and supports the recent advance of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIn this context, the latest GDP data has played a key role in strengthening the Canadian dollar. If the market continues expecting a more restrictive stance in Canada and a dovish stance in the United States, the Canadian dollar could remain the more attractive currency in the short term. This increases the likelihood that selling pressure on USD/CAD will continue dominating market behavior in the coming sessions.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The Uptrend Begins to Weaken: Since mid-July, USD/CAD had been attempting to maintain a consistent upward trendline. However, recent price action has shown notable bearish movement, pulling the pair below the 50-period moving average. If this selling pressure persists, it could result in a break of the ascending trendline, signaling a structural shift in the chart and opening the door to a dominant bearish bias in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI line currently shows a downward slope and consistent movement below the 50 level, suggesting that bearish momentum has dominated over the last 14 sessions. If RSI continues to decline, it could lead to stronger selling pressure on USD/CAD in the coming days.\n- MACD: A si"

We may have seen the start of one last week, with a strong Canadian GDP report helping complete a notable bearish reversal pattern on the weekly timeframe, pointing to the potential for further downside as we enter December.\nCanadian Data Perks Up\nFor the first time in quite a while, Canadian economic data is starting to impress relative to expectations, deviating from the trend seen over much of the second half of the year. That can be seen in the graphic below tracking Citi\u2019s economic surprise index for Canada (red line) and the United States (blue line) over 2025. For those unfamiliar, the index measures how economic data prints relative to consensus forecasts, with greater weight on recent releases to help identify trends. Readings above zero suggest more data is beating expectations than missing, with the distance from zero indicating the scale of aggregate beats.\nSource: LSEG\nIn Canada\u2019s case, at 30.7, the beat rate is now the highest level since late August, recovering after a prolonged period of disappointment earlier in the year. While the U.S. also continues to see net beats, the signal is clouded by the timing of the government shutdown, which has limited hard data flow in recent weeks, with what\u2019s been released often severely dated.\nBoC Rate Cut Pricing Dwindles\nThe shifts in data have influenced market pricing for what the Fed and BoC are expected to do with interest rates over the next year. As shown in the graphic on the left, implied pricing from swaps markets favours four 25-point reductions to the Fed funds rate by the end of next year. In contrast, while a residual risk of another cut remains priced in Canada, the collective market expects the BoC has likely concluded its easing cycle with an overnight rate of 2.25%.\nSource: Bloomberg\nWith inflation in Canada well above the BoC\u2019s 2% annual target and activity data starting to pick up, it has sown the seeds for the BoC to potentially call time on the easing cycle when it announces its final monetary policy decision of the year on December 10. When it last met in late October, the bank\u2019s guidance was ultra-cautious, suggesting the Canadian economy faced a \u201cdifficult transition\u201d due to trade tensions with the United States.\n\u201cIf inflation and economic activity evolve broadly in line with the October projection, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIf the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. Governing Council will be assessing incoming data carefully relative to the Bank\u2019s forecast.\u201d\nLabour Market Data Looms Large\nIn light of recent developments and having already delivered 275 basis points of easing this cycle, the updated guidance may solidify the neutral bias offered previously, signalling the rate-cutting cycle is done. It feels very similar to the setup before the Reserve Bank of New Zealand effectively called time on its easing cycle last week, res"

GBP/JPY trades near 205.25 at the time of writing, marking its lowest level in five days.\nBoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signalled on Monday that policymakers will actively weigh the pros and cons of a rate increase at the December monetary policy meeting. Ueda warned that delaying a rate hike too long could cause sharp inflation and force the central bank to make a rapid policy adjustment. He also noted, \u201cI want to elaborate more on the future rate hike path once we raise rates to 0.75%,\u201d suggesting that clearer forward guidance will follow the next move.\nHe added that the central bank is closely monitoring wage trends and underlying demand conditions, noting that the BoJ is \u201cactively collecting\u201d data on the wage outlook ahead of its December policy meeting.\nUeda also emphasised that a mix of the government\u2019s proactive fiscal policy and the BoJ\u2019s adjustment of monetary support will help Japan move toward a more sustainable economic growth path.\nMarkets interpreted Ueda\u2019s remarks as a clear signal that a December rate hike remains on the table. According to a Reuters report, his comments led traders to price in roughly an 80% chance of a rate increase at the December 18-19 meeting, up sharply from around 60% a week earlier.\nJapan\u2019s 10-year government bond yield also surged above 1.85% immediately after Ueda\u2019s comments, marking its highest level since July 2006.\nOn the UK side, domestic indicators offer limited support for Sterling, with the latest S&P Global survey showing the seasonally adjusted UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rising to a 14-month high of 50.2 in November from 49.7 in October, marking the first reading above the 50 neutral threshold since September 2024.\nS&P Global\u2019s Rob Dobson noted that \u201cthe numbers are especially encouraging as this improvement occurred despite November seeing elevated levels of business uncertainty, and in some cases an element of gloom, ahead of the Autumn Budget.\u201d\nLooking ahead, traders will pay close attention to remarks from Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Swati Dhingra later on Monday for cues ahead of the December 18 meeting. Focus then shifts to Tuesday\u2019s release of the Financial Stability Report and the accompanying Financial Policy Committee (FPC) Meeting Minutes.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharpl"

                "body": "The U.S. Bitcoin ETF market is experiencing a remarkable resurgence that is impossible to ignore. Investors and analysts alike are buzzing with optimism as recent inflow trends point to a significant uptick in institutional activism in the cryptocurrency realm. After a period rife with uncertainty marked by outflows, the current climate reflects a rejuvenated faith in Bitcoin and its market propositions, hinting at a transformative moment for this digital asset.\nAs of December 1st, the signs were unmistakable\u2014U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded notable inflows, culminating in a streak of four straight days of positive growth. Though the sum total of approximately $370,000 may appear trivial at first glance, it tells a more compelling story of emerging institutional commitment. This incremental increase not only illustrates resilience against market volatility but also contributes to a narrative of strengthening Bitcoin market stability. Heavyweights like Fidelity and Ark Invest seem to be steering their ships toward Bitcoin with renewed confidence, signaling that institutional players remain undeterred by market challenges.\nWhat do these inflows imply for the trajectory of Bitcoin? A detailed look reveals critical insights. A net inflow means that investments added to Bitcoin ETFs are outpacing withdrawals, reshaping the perception of these financial instruments. In one contrasting example, while BlackRock\u2019s IBIT faced a $74.03 million withdrawal, Fidelity welcomed a robust inflow of $67.02 million. This disparity underscores a selective investment strategy among institutions\u2014some funds thrive while others flounder. As capital shifts within the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem, the nuances of strategic investment decisions become increasingly pronounced.\nThe implications of these inflows extend beyond mere statistics; they mark a crucial evolution in institutional perceptions of cryptocurrencies as worthwhile assets. The steady and growing interest from institutional investors signals a potential foundation for enhancing market stability and illustrates an enduring demand from capital sources that require sophistication. This change is particularly noteworthy considering the differing appetites of retail investors, suggesting that the presence of institutional players could be key to moderating price swings and advancing market maturity in the long run.\nHowever, let us not overlook the broader context of this renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs. The expectations surrounding cryptocurrencies and their operational infrastructure are evolving as well. Various avant-garde Web3 firms are emphasizing the development of efficient crypto-to-fiat payment solutions rather than solely focusing on Bitcoin ETF exposure, with compliance taking center stage. This brings to light critical questions regarding how the capital influx into Bitcoin ETFs can not only sustain but also promote robust practices across the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nMoving forward, as the Bitcoin ETF landscape continues to shift, investors must be wary of looming regulatory frameworks and compliance challenges. It\u2019s been observed that responsible inflows frequently coincide with greater price volatility, a pattern likely to persist. Investors must cultivate a proactive approach, being ready to pivot their strategies in response to these changing dynamics.\nIn conclusion, the recent uptick in Bitcoin ETF inflows signals a vibrant resurgence of institutional engagement in the cryptocurrency sector. In a market characterized by volatility, these unwavering inflows reflect a steadfast commitment to Bitcoin and its financial applications. As the tides of investment strategy evolve, understanding the catalysts behind these movements is vital for anyone looking to capitalize on growth opportunities in the intricate and fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. Staying attuned to market sentiments can pave the way for responsible and impactful investments.\nKey Insights for Investors Eyeing Bitc"

                "body": "RLUSD supply hit $1.26B, and 82% of it now sits on Ethereum, not XRPL\nXRPL\u2019s security and reserve requirements have created friction that's pushing organic RLUSD adoption over to Ethereum.\nRipple\u2019s RLUSD stablecoin is rapidly expanding on Ethereum rather than the company\u2019s native XRP Ledger (XRPL).\nAccording to CryptoSlate data, RLUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has surged to $1.26 billion within 12 months of its launch. Of this, roughly $1.03 billion, or 82% of the total supply, resides on Ethereum, while the $235 million balance is on XRPL.\nThese numbers show that the market seems to favor the deep liquidity and composability of the Ethereum Virtual Machine over the more compliance-focused architecture of the XRPL.\nWhy RLUSD is growing on Ethereum\nThe primary driver of this disparity is the maturity of the underlying financial stack.\nOn Ethereum, RLUSD entered an environment where dollar liquidity is already entrenched. Data from DeFiLlama confirms that Ethereum continues to lead all chains in total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin supply, providing a turnkey ecosystem for new assets.\nSo, any new stablecoin that can plug into major DeFi protocols like Aave, Curve, and Uniswap immediately benefits from existing routing engines, collateral frameworks, and risk models.\nRLUSD\u2019s presence on Aave and Curve confirms this. The USDC/RLUSD pool on Curve now holds approximately $74 million in liquidity, ranking it among the larger stablecoin pools on the platform.\nFor institutional treasuries, market makers, and arbitrage desks, this depth is non-negotiable. It ensures low-slippage execution for trades in the tens of millions, facilitating basis trades and yield-farming strategies that drive modern crypto capital markets.\nOn the other hand, the XRPL is still in the nascent stages of building a DeFi foundation. Its protocol-level automated market maker (AMM) went live only in 2024. So all RLUSD-related pools on the ledger, such as the USD/RLUSD pair created in January 2025, still suffer from shallow depth and limited follow-through.\nMoreover, the XRPL AMM design has not yet attracted the liquidity provider density seen in EVM ecosystems.\nConsequently, a dollar of RLUSD placed on XRPL presently finds far fewer venues for swaps, leverage, or yield than the same dollar deployed on Ethereum.\nRLUSD\u2019s growing user base on Ethereum\nCritics might argue that RLUSD\u2019s Ethereum supply is merely \u201cvanity metrics,\u201d large sums minted but sitting idle.\nHowever, a deeper analysis of on-chain transfer data refutes this. RLUSD is showing a genuine product-market fit with Ethereum, characterized by high velocity and recurring usage.\nAccording to Token Terminal, weekly RLUSD transfer volume on Ethereum now averages approximately $1.0 billion, a dramatic increase from the $66 million average seen at the start of the year.\nThe data shows an apparent structural shift of a steady upward trend through the first half of 2025, followed by a \u201cre-basing\u201d to a significantly higher floor in the second half.\nCrucially, recent weeks show activity clustering around this elevated level rather than spiking and reverting. In market structure terms, a rising baseline typically signals a transition from a distribution phase to a utility phase.\nThis implies that the token is being used in ongoing, recurring flows, such as institutional settlement and commercial payments, rather than isolated speculative events.\nTransfer counts support this thesis. Weekly transactions on Ethereum now average 7,000, up from 240 in January.\nThe fact that transfer counts are rising in parallel with volume is a critical health indicator. If volume were rising while counts remained flat, it would suggest a market dominated by a few whales moving massive sums. Instead, the concurrent rise points to broader participation.\nFurthermore, the holder data suggest a healthy dispersion of risk. According to data from Etherscan, Ripple\u2019s RLUSD has attracted roughly 6,400 on-chain holders on Ethereum as of late"

                "body": "ETH Price Prediction: What If Ethereum Never Dips Again? The \u201cInfinite Demand Loop\u201d Theory Goes Viral\nEthereum price prediction threads are heating up again as ETH drops below $3,000 after a sharp rebound from recent lows.\nThe market is talking about an \u201cinfinite demand loop\u201d where ETF inflows, heavy staking, and constant gas burn keep eating away at supply.\nFor traders hunting the best crypto to buy now, that story is already powerful on its own. For more aggressive investors, it is also a signal to look at payment focused DeFi project plays that can sit in front of this demand wave.\nOne of the loudest whispers in that group is Remittix, a PayFi token that wants to plug Ethereum style demand directly into real world payouts. Before we get to why Remittix is attractive serious investment and a Black Friday 200% bonus crowd, it is worth looking at how this \u201cnever dipping again\u201d idea fits into any legitimate Ethereum price prediction.\nEthereum Price Prediction and the \u201cInfinite Demand Loop\u201d\nAny believable Ethereum price prediction starts with the current structure on chain. In the last three months ETH has traded as high as $4700 and seldom slipped below the $3,000 support zone. When it has, buyers have fiercely defended the $2,600 zone. Staking ratios keep rising, and gas fees from DeFi and NFT activity continue to burn ETH, which slowly shrinks the liquid supply \u2013 while demand from users and builders stays firm.\nIn this environment, the \u201cinfinite demand loop\u201d describes a feedback cycle where new sources of demand steadily squeeze ETH\u2019s supply. In this model, spot Ethereum ETFs attract fresh capital and lock those coins, taking millions of ETH off the market. At the same time, more holders stake ETH to earn yield on the proof-of-stake network, with roughly 30% of the total supply now locked in validators according to recent on-chain research.\nOn top of that, Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 fee mechanism permanently burns a portion of every transaction fee, and this has destroyed millions of ETH since its introduction and occasionally pushed the asset into net deflation. Put together, ETF inflows, staking, and gas burn all reduce the amount of ETH that\u2019s freely tradeable, while user demand for block space and long-term exposure either holds steady or grows.\nSupporters of the \u201cinfinite demand loop\u201d argue that this structural supply squeeze underpins a long-term bullish Ethereum price prediction, even if short-term volatility and macro shocks still cause sharp drawdowns along the way.\nRemittix and the Real World Side of the Demand Loop\nRemittix enters that conversation as a payments first DeFi project that aims to turn on chain demand into bank payouts for people who actually move money. The team has released a mobile wallet, pushed it live in Q3, and now runs an active beta where community users test features in real conditions.\nLive numbers show why urgency is building. The current RTX price is $0.119, more than 687 million tokens have already been acquired, and the amount raised has passed $28.3 million with over 30,000 buyers involved. The next stage of the presale will see the price move to $0.123, which means every day on the sidelines makes the entry window smaller and less generous for late arrivals.\nSecurity-focused investors are also watching the trust side. The Remittix team has completed full verification with CertiK, which is widely seen as the top name in blockchain security, and the project holds the number one slot on the CertiK leaderboard for pre-launch tokens. Few early-stage crypto plays in the payments niche can show that level of scrutiny plus a live wallet and an aggressive growth push at the same time.\nRemittix followers often highlight points like:\n-\nThe product vision focuses on turning crypto balances into real bank payouts in many countries through a single, simple app.\n-\nThe mobile wallet is already in live beta with community testers who help refine the user experience before wider rollout.\n-\nVerification and ran"

The company explicitly stated it has no plans to create its own cryptocurrency products.\nFurthermore, it will continue to block funds tied to meme coins, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has frequently criticized as high-risk securities.\n\u201cWhile Vanguard has no plans to launch its own crypto products, we serve millions of investors with diverse needs,\u201d Kadjeski explained. \u201cOur aim is to provide a brokerage platform that gives clients the ability to invest in the products they choose.\u201d"

Partners with Harmonic to Optimize Solana Validator Revenue and Network Participation\nBOCA RATON, FL, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), the first public company with a treasury strategy built to accumulate and compound Solana (\u201cSOL\u201d), today announced it has begun integrating and running the open block-building infrastructure provided by Harmonic across its Solana validator operations.\nHarmonic introduces competition and choice into Solana\u2019s block-building pipeline. Instead of relying on a single builder, validators can select from multiple block candidates each slot. This improves revenue potential, strengthens decentralization, and gives operators more control over the types of order flow they accept.\nFor DFDV, integrating Harmonic provides three clear benefits:\n-\nHigher validator revenue: Harmonic allows DFDV to automatically choose the most valuable block each slot, improving staking and validator efficiency.\n-\nGreater transparency and control: DFDV can set builder preferences that align with its standards as a public company.\n-\nEnhanced network contribution: Participating in a multi-builder system diversifies block production and helps strengthen Solana\u2019s resilience, which directly supports long-term SOL accumulation and SOL-per-Share growth.\nThe company has already integrated Harmonic into its validator stack and expects to see measurable improvements in validator performance and revenue capture in the coming weeks. The Company will monitor results and provide updates through future investor communications.\nAbout DeFi Development Corp.\nDeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) has adopted a treasury policy under which the principal holding in its treasury reserve is allocated to SOL. Through this strategy, the Company provides investors with direct economic exposure to SOL, while also actively participating in the growth of the Solana ecosystem. In addition to holding and staking SOL, DeFi Development Corp. operates its own validator infrastructure, generating staking rewards and fees from delegated stake. The Company is also engaged across decentralized finance (\u201cDeFi\u201d) opportunities and continues to explore innovative ways to support and benefit from Solana\u2019s expanding application layer.\nThe Company is an AI-powered online platform that connects the commercial real estate industry by providing data and software subscriptions, as well as value-add services, to multifamily and commercial property professionals, as the Company connects the increasingly complex ecosystem that stakeholders have to manage.\nThe Company currently serves more than one million web users annually, including multifamily and commercial property owners and developers applying for billions of dollars of debt financing per year, professional service providers, and thousands of multifamily and commercial property lenders, including more than 10% of the banks in America, credit unions, real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d), debt funds, Fannie Mae\u00ae and Freddie Mac\u00ae multifamily lenders, FHA multifamily lenders, commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) lenders, Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) lenders, and more. The Company\u2019s data and software offerings are generally offered on a subscription basis as software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d)."

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls towards $120\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis confirmed a bullish sentiment as price falls towards $120\n- The altcoin lost 10.14% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $123.\nAs of December 1, the Solana price analysis reveals a bearish market sentiment as the price falls towards the $124 mark. Overall the altcoin has lost 10.14% of its value across the last 24-hours falling towards the $120 support level.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $124\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark as higher support levels crumble. Now the price is headed to $120 where it finds the next support level.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $149.62. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $123.95\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but is quite close to the oversold region. The indicator\u2019s value has decreased to index 32.61, and its downwards curve signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows strong bearish activity at the current price level as bears erase last week\u2019s progress. The altcoin\u2019s price has decreased to $124 as bears continue to dominate the price action.\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $144.22, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $124.49, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 25.21 the RSI curve is pointing down, confirming an increase in selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator\u2019s graph indicates support from the buying side of the market at the current price level. We can expect further decline if selling activities persist for a few more hours.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect fro"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%.\nLast week\u2019s rally was largely due to rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate next week to help shore up the slowing job market. Such hopes are still high, with traders betting on a roughly 85% chance the Fed will cut at its next meeting, according to data from CME Group.\nBut yields for longer-term Treasurys nevertheless rose in the bond market Monday. It was part of a worldwide climb for yields after the head of the Bank of Japan hinted at a possible hike to interest rates there.\nWhen bonds are paying higher yields, they can attract investors who would otherwise buy stocks or cryptocurrencies. Higher yields undercut prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive.\nBitcoin, which was soaring around $125,000 in October, dropped toward $85,500. That\u2019s down roughly 6% from a day earlier.\nThat in turn sent stocks lower across the crypto industry. Coinbase Global sank 4.8%, and Robinhood Markets fell 4.1%, for example.\nStrategy, the company that used to be known as MicroStrategy and now raises money just to buy bitcoin, lost 3.3%. It said that it sold its stock and raised a fund of $1.44 billion in U.S. dollars, not in bitcoin, to help pay for its dividends on preferred shares and interest on its debt.\nOn the winning side of Wall Street was Synposys, which rose 4.9%. It said Nvidia is investing $2 billion in its stock as part of an expanded partnership. Nvidia, which has become Wall Street\u2019s most influential stock, swung from an early loss to a gain of 1.6%.\nThe market, meanwhile, had a mixed reaction to what seems like a strong start for the holiday shopping season. Consumer spending during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday retailing bonanza was expected to exceed expectations, despite uncertainty over the outlook for the U.S. economy.\nWilliams-Sonoma climbed 1.3%, but Best Buy fell 2.6%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 36.46 points to 6,812.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427.09 to 47,289.33, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 89.76 to 23,275.92.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Asia and Europe.\nFrance\u2019s CAC 40 slipped 0.3%, dragged down in part by a 5.8% loss for Airbus.\nThe European aerospace giant said Monday that most of its fleet of 6,000 A320 passenger jets have received an update after a weekend software glitch that could have affected flight controls. Travelers faced minor disruptions as airlines scrambled to push the software updates out after Airbus warned of the problem Friday.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.9% on worries about the possibility of higher interest rates. Japan\u2019s benchmark interest rate has remained near zero for years in hopes of juicing the economy. Now inflation is holding above the Bank of Japan\u2019s target of about 2%.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.02% Friday.\nIt briefly slowed its ascent in the morning after a report showed activity for U.S. manufacturers shrank by more last month than economists expected.\nJobs are under pressure at manufacturers, and the majority in a survey by the Institute for Supply Management said they\u2019re still focused more on managing headcount than on hiring. Several manufacturers also said tariffs are continuing to make things complicated.\n\u201cConditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,\u201d one manufacturer told the ISM.\n___\nAP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

                "body": "London, Monday 1 December 2025 \u2013 The UK stock market opened the final month of 2025 on a cautious note, with the FTSE 100 edging lower and domestically focused mid\u2011caps underperforming as global \u201crisk\u2011off\u201d sentiment, soft UK services data and shifting interest\u2011rate expectations weighed on investor confidence. [1]\nUK stock market today: key numbers for 1 December 2025\nBy late morning to early afternoon trading in London, the picture across UK indices looked like this:\n- FTSE 100 today was hovering around the 9,700 level, down roughly 0.1\u20130.2% on the day as investors took profits after a strong year and braced for a packed month of central\u2011bank decisions and economic data. [2]\n- The FTSE 250 \u2013 more geared to the domestic economy \u2013 fell about 0.8%, heading for its sharpest one\u2011day drop in two weeks as financial and industrial names led the declines. [3]\nThat relatively modest index move comes after a powerful rally. The FTSE 100 has repeatedly hit record highs this year, with its all\u2011time closing high of 9,911.42 set on 12 November 2025, roughly 50% above its level five years ago. [4]\nFTSE 100 vs FTSE 250: sectors driving today\u2019s moves\nBlue\u2011chip FTSE 100: modest drift lower\nLarge\u2011cap UK shares started December on the back foot but avoided the steeper losses seen in some global markets:\n- The FTSE 100 was broadly flat to slightly negative around midday, as gains in defensive consumer and mining names helped offset weakness in cyclicals and financials. [5]\n- Mining heavyweights such as Hochschild Mining and Fresnillo jumped more than 5% as gold and silver prices surged, supported by rising expectations for interest\u2011rate cuts and robust haven demand. [6]\n- Consumer staples including Unilever and Reckitt traded higher, while Glencore and Anglo American also advanced, reflecting renewed appetite for high\u2011quality global earners with pricing power. [7]\nOn the downside:\n- Aerospace and defence stocks led the fallers, with Rolls\u2011Royce down about 3% and BAE Systems off nearly 3% as investors locked in gains after a stellar multi\u2011year run driven by increased defence spending. [8]\n- Some major banks and domestic financials also traded lower, mirroring a pickup in gilt yields and a drift higher in global bond yields. [9]\nFTSE 250: mid\u2011caps under pressure\nThe bigger story today has been in the FTSE 250, which fell sharply as traders reassessed the outlook for UK\u2011centric earnings: [10]\n- The index was down around 0.8%, its worst daily move in about two weeks.\n- Homebuilders and construction\u2011linked names \u2013 including Balfour Beatty, Bellway and Taylor Wimpey \u2013 dropped more than 1.5%, reflecting concerns that higher real borrowing costs and a soft services sector could keep a lid on housing demand. [11]\n- Melrose slid nearly 6% after naming Ross McCluskey as its next CFO from 2026, with investors seemingly using the news as an opportunity to take profits following a strong run.

                "body": "London's benchmark FTSE 100 index opened December 2025 on a cautious note, experiencing a modest decline as a pervasive \"risk-off\" sentiment swept through global financial markets. This shift saw investors pull back from riskier assets, seeking refuge in safer havens amidst a confluence of economic uncertainties and geopolitical anxieties. The subdued start to the month signals a potential pivot in market dynamics after a robust performance in November, prompting a re-evaluation of investment strategies across the board.\nThe index, comprising the UK's 100 largest publicly traded companies, slipped by 0.2% on December 1, trading around 9,700 points, a slight retreat from its near record-high levels achieved just weeks prior. While the FTSE 100 (LSE: UKX) has enjoyed an impressive year-to-date gain of 18.8%, this recent dip reflects heightened investor caution. The move away from risk is a global phenomenon, with U.S. stock futures and other international equities also starting lower, and even the often-volatile cryptocurrency markets, like Bitcoin, experiencing notable drops.\nUnpacking the Drivers of Investor Caution\nThe sudden grip of risk-off sentiment can be attributed to several interconnected global and domestic factors, creating a complex web of uncertainty for investors. A primary catalyst was the unexpected hawkish commentary from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, who hinted at a potential interest rate increase at the central bank's mid-December policy meeting. This speculation sent ripples through global bond markets, causing Japanese government bond yields to surge to levels not seen since 2008 and strengthening the Japanese Yen. The concern here is the potential repatriation of vast amounts of Japanese capital, traditionally invested abroad due to cheap domestic borrowing, which could negatively impact international asset prices.\nAdding to the apprehension, investors are keenly awaiting a slew of critical U.S. economic data, including ISM manufacturing and services surveys, and ADP private payroll figures for November. These reports are pivotal in shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions, with any signs of economic weakness potentially accelerating calls for rate cuts. Simultaneously, disappointing November Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from Asia, showing continued manufacturing contraction in both Japan and China, underscored persistent weaknesses in key global economies, further dampening spirits.\nDomestically, the UK market faced its own set of pressures, with attention drawn to a speech by Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlining renewed efforts to curb welfare spending and ongoing political scrutiny surrounding Chancellor Rachel Reeves in Westminster. Lingering concerns about an \"AI bubble\" and elevated valuations in the technology sector also contributed to the cautious mood, even after a strong November rally. Finally, persistent geopolitical tensions, particularly in Eastern Europe and Venezuela, continued to simmer, adding another layer of uncertainty to the global investment landscape.\nCorporate Fortunes Diverge Amidst Risk Aversion\nIn a \"risk-off\" environment, the performance of FTSE 100 companies tends to diverge sharply, with defensive sectors typically outperforming cyclical and growth-oriented businesses. Investors prioritize stability and predictable earnings, leading to a flight towards companies with resilient business models and essential product offerings.\nOn the winning side, consumer goods giants like Unilever (LSE: ULVR) and Reckitt (LSE: RKT) saw gains on December 1. These companies, known for producing everyday essentials such as food, cleaning products, and personal care items, benefit from inelastic demand that remains relatively stable regardless of economic conditions. Similarly, precious metals miners like Fresnillo (LSE: FRES) and Endeavour Mining (LSE: EDV) emerged as \"star performers\" throughout the year and continued to provide suppor"

                "body": "Like many other FTSE 100 stocks, 2025\u2019s been a truly terrific year for Lloyds (LSE:LLOY) shares after them treading water for some time.\nThe leading UK banking stock has seen its market-cap expand by over 62% since January, driven by a combination of factors.\nThis includes:\n- Impressive net interest margins as the bank capitalises on higher interest rates to bolster lending profitability\n- Legal clarity regarding the ongoing motor financing mis-selling scandal courtesy of the UK Supreme Court\n- Improved free cash flow generation supporting a higher return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 14.6% (excluding motor financing charges), ahead of analyst expectations\nThe result of all this is that anyone who invested \u00a35,000 at the start of the year now has close to \u00a38,100. And those who reinvested the dividends paid along the way have done even better with around \u00a38,300. But can Lloyds shares do the same again in 2026?\nWhat\u2019s on the horizon?\nDespite having achieved substantial growth in 2025, the consensus from expert analyst forecasts remains very bullish. The team at Jefferies has placed a 115p share price target by this time next year. And Shore Capital is also anticipating more growth up to 110p.\nComparing these projections against the group\u2019s current share price suggests another 28% capital gain could be unlocked over the next 12 months. And when combined with the bank stock\u2019s 3.8% dividend yield, a new \u00a35,000 investment today could reach \u00a36,590 by this time next year.\nWe\u2019ve already discussed what\u2019s driving this optimism: improved legal clarity and wider profit margins.\nIf Shore Capital\u2019s correct, dividends may also be set to enjoy its sixth consecutive year of payout increases. And while the Bank of England has begun cutting interest rates, putting pressure on margins, Lloyds\u2019 hedging activities mean it could continue to benefit from elevated lending margins until 2027.\nHowever, even with this exciting outlook, there are nevertheless still several key risks to watch closely moving forward.\nRisk vs reward\nWith Lloyds joined at the hip to the UK economy, its impressive progress may ultimately be undone if the latter isn\u2019t able to bounce back. After all, low economic growth translates into low demand for borrowing.\nSo even with wider lending margins, the benefits could be limited if borrowing volumes are subdued. There is also still the fallout relating to the motor financing scandal.\nWhile the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling significantly reduced uncertainty, Lloyds isn\u2019t out of the woods just yet, and the impact is already weighing on the all-important RoTE. When including the related costs for motor financing, the RoTE drops from 14.6% to 11.9%.\nThat\u2019s certainly not terrible, but it\u2019s behind management\u2019s 12% target. And if economic conditions were to move in the wrong direction, a sudden increase in loan defaults and a decrease in credit quality could drag the bank\u2019s performance even lower.\nThe bottom line\nAs bank stocks go, Lloyds seems to be in a relatively strong position, even with some regulatory uncertainty. However, with its fate ultimately tied to that of the British economy, and the latter achieves lacklustre growth, I think there are better opportunities to explore in this space rather than Lloyds."

                "body": "Global Risk-Off: Yen Strength, Fed Bets, and DAX Stuck in Range\nMarket Tone\nBroad risk-off. Asian equities reversed November\u2019s momentum. US and European futures softer. Crypto dropped more than 5%.\nJapan and FX Dynamics\nYen firmed toward 155.5 after Ueda opened the door to a rate hike. JGB yields reached 2008 highs. Nikkei fell ~2%. Market focus shifted to normalisation risks and fiscal pressures.\nUSD/JPY pulled back as risk appetite in Japan deteriorated and officials stressed that recent yen weakness is not fundamentals-driven. Ueda signalled readiness to raise rates if baseline projections hold and indicated December as an active decision point.\nUS Outlook\nKey releases ahead: manufacturing, services, sentiment surveys. Powell\u2019s comments in focus. Markets price an 87% probability of a rate cut next week.\nConsumption remains firm. Black Friday data: Mastercard +4.1% y/y retail, +10.4% y/y ecommerce; Adobe +9.1% y/y to USD 11.7bn. Early holiday performance supports a soft-landing narrative.\nOil +1% after OPEC+ maintained Q1 2026 output. Gold and silver initially rallied before fading.\nCyrusOne restored stability at its Chicago 1 data center.\nEurozone Inflation\nMixed country signals ahead of euro-area November release.\nGermany: HICP 2.6% (highest in nine months, above consensus); national CPI unchanged at 2.3%; core eased to 2.7%. Spain: 3.1% (above consensus). Italy: 1.1% (below).\nECB likely to remain on hold and wait for trend clarity.\nDAX Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows Germany 40 locked in a prolonged sideways range between the major resistance at 24,884 and the strong support at 23,087, marked by the red horizontal line. Price recently bounced from this support after a sharp decline, but the current level near 23,670 remains below the mid-range pivot at 23,740 (yellow line), which has acted as a key decision point throughout the year. The inability to break above this pivot so far keeps the structure neutral-to-bearish, with the broader pattern resembling a distribution phase rather than an accumulation.\nMomentum indicators reflect a fragile recovery. MACD is slightly positive but lacks strong divergence, signaling weak bullish momentum. RSI at 47.21 is neutral, showing neither oversold nor overbought conditions, which aligns with the range-bound nature of the market. A decisive close above 23,740 would open the path toward 24,200 and possibly 24,884, while rejection at this level risks a retest of 23,087 and, if broken, a deeper move toward 22,400 or even 20,414 as indicated by the blue support zone.\nEnergy Sector Structural Shift\nData-center and AI electricity demand rising sharply, with global data-center consumption expected to triple by 2035.\nConcentration in the US, China, EU strains local grids. Infrastructure, storage, and generation investment required across renewables, nuclear, and gas. Long-dated contracts limit near-term earnings leverage, but structurally higher power demand supports long-run margins.\nKey Events This Week\nEarnings\nEurope: Aurubis; Industria de Dise\u00f1o Textil.\nUS: Ten S&P 500 names including CrowdStrike, Salesforce, Dollar General, Hormel Foods, HP, Cooper, Kroger.\nMacro Data\n\u2022 Monday (US): ISM manufacturing expected at 49.0.

Analysts expect revenue of $1.11 billion and an EPS loss of $(1.05), according to consensus estimates from Capital IQ.\nRivian enters the day under intense scrutiny as it continues to pivot from aggressive growth toward operational discipline.

As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 3% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\nBest Q3: Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ)\nPowering the cards behind innovative fintech services like Block's Cash App, Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ) provides a cloud-based platform that allows businesses to create customized payment card programs and process card transactions.\nMarqeta reported revenues of $163.3 million, up 27.6% year on year.

                "body": "Nick E. Tarabay was in France when he got a text message from veteran showrunner Steven S. DeKnight, the man he spent years working with in the early 2010s on Starz\u2019s Spartacus franchise playing Ashur, a turncoat slave and gladiator that audiences loved to hate.\nAshur had met his end in 2013\u2019s Spartacus: Vengeance, but the character never truly left DeKnight\u2019s mind, which is why he picked up the phone to ask Tarabay a question. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Nick, what are you doing for the next five to six years?\u201d recalled the actor.\nRelated Stories\nDeKnight pitched Tarabay on playing Ashur once more in a new revisionist history series that imagines what would have happened had Ashur lived. Thankfully, the actor gave a resounding \u201cyes\u201d to DeKnight\u2019s pitch, and the series, Spartacus: House of Ashur, now premieres Dec. 5 on Starz. And just like the initial series that debuted back in 2010, the show brings back slow-motion blood-letting, orgies galore, and plenty of sudsy soap opera machinations.\nDeKnight and Tarabay recently came together for a lively conversation at the London Hotel for the very first Heat Vision Live event \u2014 a screening and Q&A series hosted by The Hollywood Reporter with a focus on all things great about genre film and television. And House of Ashur certainly fits that bill with sword-clashing, trident-piercing, hammer-smashing action sequences paired with visually-flourishing storytelling. (Watch the full conversation, moderated by THR senior film writer and creator of the Heat Vision blog Borys Kit, at the top of this post.)\nIn an era in which TV feels a little tamer, the series is boundary-pushing as ever, with its sex and violence. DeKnight said that he hasn\u2019t found a boundary he isn\u2019t willing to cross and received support from Starz, as well as producer Lionsgate TV. In fact, after a certain, um, dismemberment near the end of episode two, \u201d I was sure we were going to get a note about that,\u201d he recalled. Instead? \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cThis time in ancient Rome was a brutal, brutal time and hypersexual,\u201d said DeKnight, who is particularly proud of the show\u2019s introduction of a female gladiator. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful to Lionsgate and Starz that I have not gotten a note that said, \u2018Whoa, can you pull it back?\u2019\u201d\nDeKnight struck a defiant tone when it was suggested a parents group could become agitated due to all the sex and violence.\n\u201cI welcome a parents advisory out for blood,\u201d he said , aughing.\nStill, ideas about sexuality and performer safety have evolved since Spartacus bowed in 15 years ago, before intimacy coordinators became commonplace on big productions. \u201cI come from a theater world where we didn\u2019t have an intimacy coordinator. We would just talk about it. \u2018What are you OK with? What are you not OK with?\u2019\u201d Tarabay said. The House of Ashur set employed intimacy coordinators for performers who wanted them. Tarabay continued, \u201cBringing that in is great for the new generation. That\u2019s awesome. But also being nude, after a while, it becomes easy. It becomes just another scene.\u201d\nDuring the Q&A, Tarabay came off as a boisterous, fun-loving sort of guy, revealing he relishes fight training, which for the show included a month of gladiator camp, comprised of four hours of training a day, \u201cfrom weapons to jiujitsu, to grappling, to wrestling, to CrossFit,\u201d he said.\nBut one line Tarabay wouldn\u2019t cross is changing the lines on set. The show is known for a certain style of speaking and a specific diction. DeKnight describes is as \u201cShakespeare meets Conan the Barbarian.\u201d Each word was written with painstaking precision by DeKnight and his writer\u2019s room, crafted to give the sense that you are in another time, even if it\u2019s not accurate to how the Romans actually spoke.\n\u201cThe dialogue\u2019s so specific, it\u2019s got to be word for word,\u201d said DeKnight, who recalled being on set and noticing when an actor dropped a single word. \u201cWhen it\u2019s improvised or wrong, it\u2019s like a record skipping. You can tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.\u201d\nEven before the new sho"

(NASDAQ:NBIS) is a key stock in the AI ecosystem. It operates in the capacity side of the equation, which includes GPU clusters and cloud platforms. The firm completed its secondary offering in September.\nWith Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) closed at $94.87, Citizens Financial set a $175 price target for the firm on November 19th. The bank also set a Market Outperform rating on the shares and outlined that the rating was based on Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS)\u2019s deals with Microsoft and Meta. The Microsoft deal is valued at $17.4 billion and is spread out over a five-year term. Its announcement sent the shares 47% higher in September. Citizens added that, along with the Meta deal, the engagements allow Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) to become a solid player in the AI ecosystem. Crucially, for Citizens, the two tech giants\u2019 decision to work with the firm meant that Nebius Group N.V.

As I said, the size of the deal was limited only by the capacity that we had available, and if we had more capacity, we could have signed a bigger deal, probably. After we announced Microsoft in September, we said that we would have more deals of this kind, more large deals. And actually, we\u2019re delivering on that promise, and we\u2019re optimistic as these deals will arise more and more. However, these mega deals are important, but it\u2019s important to stress that we will remain focused on developing our own AI cloud, which currently serves not only these big deals but AI startups and enterprises. Ultimately, we believe that these large contracts provide us with great sourcing of financing for us to continue building our core AI cloud business.\u201d\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Bearish chart signals point to growing downside risks, with key support levels now in play. At the same time, BOJ hawkish bets have driven bond yields to fresh cycle highs, narrowing rate differentials and boosting the yen. If these trends persist, the headwinds for stocks could intensify, making the coming sessions critical for direction.\nBearish Chart Signals Emerge\u2026\nA bearish engulfing candle on our Japan 225 contract coincides with an obvious three-candle evening star pattern in futures, delivering a double dose of bearish signals that point to growing downside risks for Japanese stocks.\nSource: TradingView\nCurrently, long-running uptrend support dating back to the April lows and the 50DMA are in close proximity beneath where the contract trades, making that a key support zone to focus on should the signals from the price action prove reliable.\nIf we see a clean break and close beneath the zone, it would allow for shorts to be established with a stop above the 50DMA to protect against reversal, targeting 48,400 support initially. If that gives way, 47,000, 45,170 and 42,000 were levels that saw plenty of price action either side earlier in the year, putting them on the radar as targets should we see a sustained unwind.\nOf course, if the support zone comprising the 50DMA and uptrend support holds, it would allow for long setups to be considered, targeting 50,580 and 51,500 resistance initially. A stop beneath the 50DMA would protect against reversal.\nRSI (14) and MACD are delivering neutral signals, a departure from what was seen in recent months when upside strength was dominant. While both indicators are gradually moving towards bearish territory right now, the preference remains to let price action and signals determine how to proceed.\n\u2026As Macro Headwinds Build\nFundamentally, you can\u2019t escape that markets interpreted Monday\u2019s speech from Bank of Japan governor Ueda as mildly hawkish, seeing traders move to price in the risk of a 25 basis point hike on December 19 at around 80%. That saw large parts of the Japanese government bond curve rupture higher, with yields for two, five, 10 and 20-year tenors hitting fresh cycle highs, helping underpin gains in the Japanese yen as relative interest rate differentials narrowed with other nations.\nShould the trends from Monday continue, it points to mounting headwinds for Japanese equities, both from a valuation and earnings perspective given how many constituents in the Nikkei derive a large share of revenues from offshore. If the move in JGBs and yen stalls, it may act as a release valve that temporarily reduces downside risks for stocks."

It had tumbled 1.9% on Monday, breaking below the psychological barrier of 50,000.\nThe broader Topix TOPIX climbed 0.2% to 3,346.34 following a 1.2% slide in the previous session.\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said in a speech on Monday that policymakers would consider the \"pros and cons\" of a December rate hike, sending the strongest signal yet of near-term policy tightening.\nThis marked a hawkish shift in tone by Ueda, who had generally been a voice of caution among the central bank's policy board members.\n\"Ueda's message changed, and that had a big impact on the stock market,\" said Kenji Abe, an equities strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nHowever, even if a quarter-point hike comes at the December 18-19 meeting, the policy rate would still be accommodative, and coupled with improving corporate earnings, will continue to support the stock market, Abe said.\nDaiwa expects the Nikkei to rise to 60,000 by the end of next year and the Topix to climb to 4,000.\nOn Tuesday, Fanuc 6954 was the Nikkei's best performer in terms of percentage gains, rising 7.4% after the robot maker announced a collaboration with Nvidia NVDA to promote so-called \"physical AI\", with artificial intelligence integrated into robots.\nUniqlo owner Fast Retailing 9983 was the biggest gainer by index points due to its extremely heavy weighting. The stock's 1.4% increase contributed 78 points to the Nikkei's total 196-point rise.\nThe biggest drag on the Nikkei was startup investor SoftBank Group 9984, which sank 2%.\nToyota Motor 7203 dropped 0.9% amid declines across automaker shares as a sharp appreciation in the yen overnight lowered the value of overseas revenues.\nOf the Nikkei's 225 components, 111 rose versus 112 that fell, with two trading flat."
