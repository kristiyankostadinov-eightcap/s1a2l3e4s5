The upcoming Q4 2025 earnings on 18 February 2026 are a key short term catalyst, as they will show whether strong recent profitability is keeping pace with higher expectations. The analyst target hikes themselves do not materially change the core risk that costs could erode margins.\nThe most relevant recent development is Kinross\u2019s aggressive capital return program, with about US$600,000,000 spent on buybacks in 2025 alongside consistent US$0.03 quarterly dividends. Against rising gold prices and a strong share price, this capital allocation stance magnifies the impact of any upside or downside surprise in Q4 results, because it ties shareholder outcomes more tightly to ongoing free cash flow strength and cost control.\nYet investors should also be aware that if operating and capital costs rise faster than expected across key mines, the impact on Kinross\u2019s margins and cash returns could be...\nRead the full narrative on Kinross Gold (it's free!)\nKinross Gold's narrative projects $6.4 billion revenue and $1.5 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Kinross Gold's forecasts yield a CA$43.53 fair value, a 7% downside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives\nSome of the most optimistic analysts were already penciling in about US$7.4 billion of revenue and US$2.1 billion of earnings by 2028, so with gold surging and Q4 results imminent, it is worth asking whether that upbeat path still holds or if the cost and geopolitical risks might push the story in a different direction.\nExplore 5 other fair value estimates on Kinross Gold - why the stock might be worth as much as 28% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Kinross Gold Narrative\nDisagree with existing narratives?

On the US supply side, Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by three to 409 this week. Oil prices had strengthened earlier in the week on concerns that the US could attack Middle Eastern oil producer Iran over its nuclear programme. But comments on Thursday from US President Donald Trump that Washington could make a deal with Iran over the next month drove down prices on Thursday.\nThe Pentagon, however, is sending an aircraft carrier from the Caribbean to the Middle East, US officials said on Friday, a move that would put two carriers in the region as tensions soar between the United States and Iran. Russia, meanwhile, said on Friday that the next round of peace talks on Ukraine will take place next week.\nNegotiations with Iran and Russia will be the near-term market movers, Kissler said, adding that near-term global crude supplies remain ample and crude futures likely have a $5 to $7 per barrel geopolitical premium baked in. The US also eased sanctions on Venezuela's energy sector on Friday, issuing two general licenses that allow global energy companies to operate oil and gas projects in the OPEC member and for other companies to negotiate contracts to bring in fresh investments.

The pair is trading near 1.1870 at the time of writing, little changed on the day but still heading for small weekly gains.\nUS inflation came in softer than expected in January. Headline CPI rose 0.2% on the month, below market expectations and easing from December\u2019s 0.3% increase. On a yearly basis, CPI slowed to 2.4% from 2.7%, undershooting forecasts of 2.5%.\nCore inflation was more mixed. CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.3% MoM, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% previously, while the annual core rate eased slightly to 2.5% from 2.6%, matching market forecasts.\nIn reaction to the data, the US Dollar gave up its earlier gains, while Treasury yields extended their decline as easing inflation pressures bolstered expectations of monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, is trading near 96.91 at the time of writing, pulling back from an intraday high of 97.15.\nUS rate futures repriced sharply after the CPI report, with markets now pricing in around 61 basis points (bps) of Fed rate cuts in 2026, up from about 58 bps just before the release. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets assign around a 65% probability to the first rate cut being delivered in the June-July window.\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold through 2026, pointing to a growing policy divergence with the Fed and leaving the EUR/USD tilted to the upside. However, the recent appreciation of the Euro could complicate the outlook.\nECB policymaker Martins Kazaks said on Friday that ECB officials are \u201cin monitoring mode on euro strength\u201d and warned earlier this week that a \u201csizeable and pacey\u201d appreciation could weigh on the inflation outlook and potentially trigger a policy response.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the "

                "body": "EUR/USD ended the week at 1.1868, remaining within a narrow sideways range for the fourth consecutive session. The market has adopted a wait-and-see approach ahead of the release of January\u2019s US consumer price index. The report could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy.\nForecasts suggest a slowdown in headline inflation to 2.5% year-on-year from 2.7%, while core inflation is expected to ease to 2.5% from 2.6%.\nEarlier in the week, strong employment data confirmed the resilience of the labour market, although recent jobless claims came in higher than expected. Investors are now pricing in rates remaining unchanged in March, followed by two 25-basis-point cuts in the second half of the year, in June and September.\nThe broader backdrop for EUR/USD remains clear: most Fed officials have adopted a wait-and-see stance and are not ready to resume rate cuts imminently. Despite previous easing and the current rate range of 3.50-3.75%, inflation remains below 3%, and the economy continues to demonstrate stability. January\u2019s employment data only strengthens the case for a pause.\nWhile some Fed policymakers support further easing, they remain in the minority. The market is shifting expectations for the first cut closer to July. For EUR/USD, this maintains structural support for the dollar. The pair\u2019s next move will depend on inflation and signs of a real cooling in the US economy.\nTechnical Analysis\nOn the H4 chart, EUR/USD remains in a sideways consolidation phase following January\u2019s upward momentum. The price is held within the 1.1785-1.1930 range and is currently trading near 1.1870. Bollinger Bands have narrowed, signalling declining volatility. The MACD is hovering near the zero line, indicating weak momentum, while the Stochastic oscillator remains neutral, without a clear directional signal. The market is trading in the middle of the range.\nOn the H1 chart, price action reflects a tight consolidation with occasional volatility spikes. Buyers quickly absorbed the latest downward move, but attempts to break above 1.1925 have failed. The price has stabilised near the midline of the Bollinger Bands. The MACD remains close to zero, and the Stochastic oscillator is turning lower in neutral territory. In the near term, range trading remains the preferred strategy.\nConclusion\nIn summary, EUR/USD remains in a state of consolidation, trapped in its narrowest range in weeks as markets await the crucial US inflation report. The pair is caught between two opposing forces: resilient US economic data and delayed Fed easing expectations (supporting the dollar), versus a relatively hawkish ECB stance and already priced-in policy divergence (supporting the euro).\nTechnically, compressed volatility and neutral indicators signal a breakout may be approaching, but its direction will depend entirely on tonight\u2019s CPI outcome. A hotter-than-expected inflation reading would likely push the pair towards the lower boundary at 1.1785, while softer inflation could trigger a retest of resistance near 1.1930. Until then, the range remains the game."

Inflation Rate declined from 2.7% in December to 2.4% in January, compared to analyst forecast of 2.5%.\nCore Inflation Rate decreased from 2.6% to 2.5%, in line with analyst estimates.\nThe surprising report provided significant support to Treasuries as traders rushed to bet on dovish Fed.\nThe yield of 2-year Treasuries pulled back towards the 3.40% level, while the yield of 10-year Treasuries declined towards the 4.05% level.\nInterestingly, falling Treasury yields did not put pressure on the American currency. Forex traders believe that Fed Chair Powell may keep rates unchanged until the end of his term to highlight Fed\u2019s independence.\nThe nearest resistance level for U.S. Dollar Index is located in the 97.10 \u2013 97.25 range. In case U.S. Dollar Index climbs above the 97.25 level, it will move towards the next resistance near recent highs at 98.00 \u2013 98.15.\nEUR/USD is flat as traders focus on U.S. CPI data and react to economic reports from the EU.\nGermany\u2019s Wholesale Prices increased by +0.9% month-over-month in January, compared to analyst consensus of +0.1%.\nEuro Area employment increased by +0.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while analysts expected that it would grow by +0.6%.\nEUR/USD continues its attempts to settle below the nearest support at 1.1835 \u2013 1.1850. If EUR/USD manages to settle below the 1.1835 level, it will move towards the next support, which is located in the 1.1770 \u2013 1.1785 range.\nRSI remains in the moderate territory, so there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.\nGBP/USD is swinging between gains and losses as traders focus on CPI data from the U.S.\nThere are no important economic reports scheduled to be released in the UK today, so traders will stay focused on Fed policy outlook.\nThe British pound has mostly ignored the recent political crisis in the UK, which may indicate that the currency has the potential to get stronger in the near term.\nGBP/USD is trying to settle above the 50 MA at 1.3637. In case this attempt is successful, GBP/USD will move towards the next resistance level at 1.3710 \u2013 1.3725.\nOn the support side, a successful test of the support at 1.3570 \u2013 1.3585 will open the way to the test of the next support at 1.3485 \u2013 1.3500.\nUSD/CAD is stuck in a tight range as traders monitor the rebound in precious metals markets.\nGold managed to climb back above the $5000 level, while silver climbed above the $77.00 level. Precious metals are moving higher as traders react to U.S. inflation data.\nOther commodity-related currencies are losing ground in today\u2019s trading session, so rising commodity markets did not provide material support to this segment of the forex market.\nIf USD/CAD settles above the 50 MA at 1.3617, it will get to the test of the resistance level at 1.3650 \u2013 1.3665.\nUSD/JPY is moving higher despite falling Treasury yields. Some traders are ready to bet on a rebound after the strong pullback, which pushed USD/JPY from 157.50 to 152.50.\nCurrently, USD/JPY is trying to settle above the 153.00 level. In case USD/JPY settles above 153.00, it will head towards the nearest resistance, which is located in the 154.50 \u2013 155.00 range. A move above the 155.00 level will push USD/JPY towards the next resistance at 158.00 \u2013 158.50.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about how to trade forex, please visit our educational area.\nVladimir is an independent trader, with over 18 years of experience in the financial markets.

CPI dipped from 2.7% in December to 2.4% YoY, while core figure was aligned with estimates fo 2.5%, down from 2.6% in the previous month.\nThe resumption of the disinflation process pushed traders to price in 63 basis points of Fed easing towards the end of the year, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nFollowing the data release, Greenback remained steady, as depicted by the US Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY, which tracks the buck\u2019s value against a basket of six currencies, is firm at 96.96.\nNow the question is whether the Fed would remain in pause or cut rates, due to the latest inflation print. The labor market had shown signs of strength, while prices are finally edging towards the Fed\u2019s goal. So far, for the June meeting, odds are at a 58% chance for a rate reduction.\nIn the UK, political turmoil spurred by the linkage of the US ambassador nominees proposed by the Prime Minister Keir Starmer to Jeffrey Epstein, put into question Starmer leadership. Nevertheless, Starmer\u2019s cabinet is on his side, a sign of relief for GBP buyers.\nNonetheless, Pound bulls are not out of the woods, as the recent UK GDP figures and the latest Bank of England (BoE) monetary policy decision had increased the odds for a cut in subsequent meetings.\nFor the March 19 meeting, there\u2019s a 64% chance for a BoE rate cut of 25 basis points. However, hawkish comments by BoE Huw Pill was hawkish, despite acknowledging that the disinflation process is intact, but not complete.\nPil added that core inflation should be the main focus and that policy needs to remain restrictive.\nNext week the UK economic docket will feature job data, inflation and Retail Sales. In the US, traders would digest speeches by Fed policymakers, Durable Goods Orders, jobs data, GDP figures and the Fed preferred inflation gauge, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index.\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3622.

The pair is currently testing the crucial 1.3600 support level, a zone that coincides with the lower boundary of its established ascending channel. This convergence creates a significant inflection point for traders and analysts monitoring the sterling\u2019s trajectory against the US dollar. Market participants are closely watching this area for signals that will determine the near-term directional bias, as a decisive break could trigger substantial volatility. The outcome of this test will likely hinge on a confluence of technical signals and evolving macroeconomic fundamentals from both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nGBP/USD Technical Structure and the 1.3600 Confluence\nTechnical analysts emphasize the importance of the current price action. The GBP/USD has been trading within a well-defined ascending channel for several months, characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows. The lower trendline of this channel, which acts as dynamic support, is now intersecting with the static, psychologically significant support level at 1.3600. This creates a powerful technical confluence zone. A sustained hold above this combined support area would reinforce the prevailing bullish structure, suggesting the uptrend remains intact. Conversely, a daily close below 1.3600, particularly on elevated volume, would represent a breakdown of the channel and signal a potential trend reversal or a deeper corrective phase. Key momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), are being scrutinized for bullish or bearish divergence signals as price approaches this critical level.\nKey Technical Levels to Monitor\nBeyond the immediate 1.3600 support, several other price levels frame the technical landscape. Immediate resistance is seen near the recent swing high around 1.3750, followed by the psychological 1.3800 handle. On the downside, a breach of 1.3600 would likely target the next significant support zone near 1.3500, which aligns with the 100-day simple moving average and previous consolidation areas. The following table outlines the primary technical levels for GBP/USD:\nMacroeconomic Drivers Influencing Cable in 2025\nThe technical test at 1.3600 is not occurring in a vacuum. It is fundamentally driven by shifting expectations regarding monetary policy and economic performance. On the UK side, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) forward guidance on interest rates remains a primary driver. Recent inflation data and labor market reports are carefully analyzed for clues on the timing and pace of any future policy adjustments. Furthermore, the UK\u2019s economic growth projections and fiscal policy announcements continue to influence sterling sentiment. Market participants are assessing whether the UK economy demonstrates sufficient resilience to support a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 rate environment compared to its peers.\nSimultaneously, the US dollar\u2019s strength is a critical counterweight. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path, particularly in light of recent US employment and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, directly impacts the USD side of the pair. Strong US economic data typically bolsters the dollar, adding downward pressure on GBP/USD. Key factors currently under analysis include:\n- Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between BoE and Fed policy rates.\n- Inflation Trajectories: Comparative progress toward 2% targets in both economies.\n- Growth Outlooks: Relative economic resilience and recession risks.\n- Risk Sentiment: Global market volatility often benefits the USD as a safe haven.\nExpert Analysis on the Channel Boundary Test\nSenior analysts from major financial institutions provide context for this technical ev"

Despite recent volatility, the AUD/USD pair appears supported by cautious but relatively firm expectations surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) monetary policy stance.\nRBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter signaled that labor market conditions are likely to remain tight, while inflation is expected to stay above the central bank\u2019s target for an extended period. She highlighted ongoing capacity pressures within both the broader economy and the labor market, suggesting that inflation risks remain tilted to the upside.\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock reinforced this cautious stance, stressing that the Board remains prepared to tighten policy further if inflation proves more persistent than anticipated. She remarked that any inflation rate beginning with \u201cthree\u201d would be unacceptable, underlining the central bank\u2019s firm commitment to price stability. Bullock also emphasized that policy decisions will continue to depend heavily on incoming economic data, with forecasts regularly reviewed and adjusted.\nAdding to the hawkish undertone, Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations climbed to 5.0% in February from 4.6%, marking the first reading above 5% in seven months. The broad-based rise strengthens the rationale behind the RBA\u2019s recent move to lift the cash rate to 3.85% and suggests inflation concerns are far from resolved.\nMeanwhile, attention shifts to the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Headline inflation is projected to ease to 2.5% from 2.7%, while core inflation is expected to moderate slightly to 2.5%. A softer inflation print could reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve may resume rate cuts later this year.\nMarkets currently anticipate two Fed rate reductions in 2026, likely beginning in the second half of the year, though uncertainty persists regarding future balance sheet policies under Kevin Warsh\u2019s anticipated leadership.\nTrade Idea:\nBuy AUD/USD on dips near key support around 0.6550, targeting 0.6680, with a stop below 0.6480, as RBA\u2019s hawkish bias may limit downside despite US data risks."

Consequently, this movement creates upward pressure on the Krona. Nordea\u2019s currency strategists document these flows through multiple channels. Swedish multinational corporations lead this trend by bringing overseas profits home. Additionally, institutional investors rebalance portfolios toward domestic assets. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment shows renewed interest in Swedish technology and green energy sectors.\nThe Swedish Riksbank\u2019s monetary policy framework supports this trend. Specifically, interest rate differentials with the Eurozone and United States attract capital. Furthermore, Sweden\u2019s stable political environment contrasts with global uncertainties. The country\u2019s robust fiscal position also enhances investor confidence. These factors collectively contribute to SEK appreciation against both the Euro and US Dollar.\nNordea\u2019s Analysis of Currency Market Shifts\nNordea Markets provides comprehensive research on SEK movements. Their analysts track real-time transaction data across banking systems. This monitoring reveals patterns invisible to casual observers. The financial institution employs sophisticated models to predict currency trajectories. Their methodology combines quantitative analysis with macroeconomic assessment.\nHistorical context illuminates current developments. Previously, SEK experienced pressure during global risk-off periods. However, structural changes now provide insulation. Sweden\u2019s export composition shifted toward higher-value goods. Meanwhile, import dependency on volatile commodities decreased. These economic transformations fundamentally alter currency dynamics.\nExpert Insights on Sustainable Strength\nCurrency specialists emphasize multifaceted drivers behind SEK performance. First, Sweden\u2019s innovation economy attracts global capital. Second, pension fund allocations increasingly favor domestic investments. Third, corporate hedging strategies evolved to manage currency exposure. Fourth, trade balance improvements provide fundamental support.\nComparative analysis with other currencies reveals unique characteristics. Unlike the Norwegian Krone, SEK demonstrates less oil correlation. Compared to the Swiss Franc, it offers higher yield potential. Against the Japanese Yen, Sweden maintains positive interest rates. These differentials create attractive opportunities for international investors.\nEconomic Impacts of Krona Appreciation\nCurrency strength produces complex economic consequences. Swedish exporters face competitive challenges in international markets. However, importers benefit from lower input costs. Consumers enjoy increased purchasing power for foreign goods. Meanwhile, inflation dynamics respond to exchange rate movements.\nThe Riksbank monitors these developments carefully. Their dual mandate requires balancing price stability with employment. Current analysis suggests manageable trade-offs. Manufacturing sectors adapt through productivity improvements. Service industries capitalize on domestic demand growth. The overall economy demonstrates remarkable flexibility.\nKey economic indicators show positive trends:\n- GDP growth maintains 2.1% annual pace\n- Unemployment remains at 6.8% structural level\n- Inflation stabilizes near 2% target\n- Current account shows \u20ac8.3 billion surplus\nGlobal Context for Currency Movements\nInternational developments influence SEK trajectories.

Market participants globally watched this critical currency cross closely, particularly after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released April 2025 inflation figures showing a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI, below the 0.3% consensus forecast. Consequently, this development immediately influenced Federal Reserve policy expectations and triggered significant repositioning across major currency pairs.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis and Immediate Market Reaction\nTraders witnessed the USD/JPY pair retreat from Wednesday\u2019s high of 155.45 to current levels around 154.80, representing a 0.4% decline during the Asian trading session. Market analysts observed substantial selling pressure emerging after the US CPI release, with the Dollar Index (DXY) itself falling 0.3% to 104.15. Meanwhile, Japanese financial institutions demonstrated consistent Yen buying throughout the session, particularly around the 155.00 psychological level. Technical indicators showed the pair breaking below its 20-day moving average for the first time in two weeks, suggesting potential near-term weakness.\nForeign exchange desks reported increased volatility during the London-New York overlap, with trading volumes exceeding 30-day averages by approximately 18%. Market participants noted that option-related flows contributed to the downward pressure, especially as barrier options at 155.50 remained untested. The price action created a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, typically indicating potential reversal momentum. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) declined from overbought territory above 70 to a more neutral 58, reducing immediate selling pressure but maintaining downward bias.\nUS Inflation Data Breakdown and Federal Reserve Implications\nThe April 2025 US Consumer Price Index report revealed several critical details influencing currency markets. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy components, increased just 0.2% month-over-month, bringing the annual rate to 2.8%\u2014the lowest reading since August 2023. Shelter costs, representing approximately one-third of the CPI basket, rose 0.3% monthly, showing continued moderation from earlier in the year. Goods inflation remained negative for the third consecutive month, while services inflation decelerated to 0.25% from 0.4% in March.\nFederal Reserve officials immediately responded to the data, with several regional bank presidents noting the progress toward their 2% inflation target. According to CME FedWatch Tool probabilities, markets now price just a 15% chance of a July 2025 rate hike, down from 35% before the CPI release. The terminal rate expectation shifted downward by 5 basis points to 3.75%, reflecting reduced inflationary pressures. This recalibration directly impacted Dollar valuation across all major pairs, not just USD/JPY, as lower rate expectations typically diminish currency attractiveness.\nComparative Inflation Metrics: United States vs Japan\nThis comparative analysis reveals narrowing differentials between US and Japanese inflation rates, reducing one fundamental support pillar for USD/JPY appreciation. The convergence trend began in late 2024 and has accelerated through the first quarter of 2025, according to International Monetary Fund data. Consequently, interest rate differentials between the two countries have compressed by approximately 40 basis points year-to-date, directly impacting currency valuation models.\nJapanese Yen Fundamentals and Bank of Japan Policy Stance\nDespite the Bank of Japan maintaining its ultra-ac"

Japanese government bonds steadied, with ultra-long yields giving back earlier jumps, which cooled near-term fiscal jitters. Officials also signaled they\u2019re still watching for one-way yen moves, keeping the threat of intervention in the background. At the same time, BoJ commentary has turned a touch more confide..\nnt that 2% inflation can stick if wage growth holds up, strengthening the case that Japan\u2019s ultra-easy policy is finally nearing an exit.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A policy gap that may finally start to narrow.\nFor years, Japan has been the market\u2019s go-to funding currency while US rates stayed high. Rates markets already price modest BoJ tightening by April, so jawboning alone may not be enough to keep lifting the yen. The bigger question is delivery \u2013 if the BoJ hikes sooner or signals a quicker pace than expected, the yen could extend its rebound; if it disappoints and US yields stay firm, the rally may fade.\nZooming out: Bond investors are keeping Japan honest.\nMoves in ultra-long JGB yields are a quick check on whether investors trust Japan\u2019s fiscal path. The pullback in 30-year yields suggests debt worries have eased for now, which reduces pressure on policymakers. That gives the BoJ more room to focus on the wage\u2013inflation cycle, rather than defending financial stability.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

The bank\u2019s twist is to watch Canada\u2019s dollar against peers like the Norwegian krone, Brazilian real, and Chilean peso, since broad US dollar weakness can hide Canada-specific stress in USD\u2013CAD. RBC sketches outcomes from a routine review, to a messier path of non-renewal that forces frequent review..\ns and drags uncertainty out, to low-probability tail scenarios like a formal US withdrawal notice. It expects uncertainty to peak in the first half of 2026, while the Bank of Canada looks comfortable holding rates unless data deteriorate.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Sometimes FX stress shows up in the cross rates.\nTrade angst usually seeps into a currency through a higher risk premium, and that can be clearer in CAD\u2019s performance versus other commodity currencies than versus the US dollar. RBC also points to rate differentials: if Canadian yields fall relative to US Treasuries, the loonie\u2019s carry appeal can fade, especially versus higher-yielding alternatives. In other words, you could see a softer CAD even without a dramatic headline move in USD\u2013CAD.\nZooming out: Trade policy could steal the spotlight from inflation.\nCanada\u2019s inflation story is cooling, but the next macro swing factor may be the USMCA review timetable and the uncertainty it creates for investment and exports. That leaves markets more sensitive to each data print and central-bank signal, since weaker growth would make rate cuts more plausible while trade noise stays high. Globally, the backdrop matters too: shifts in US inflation expectations and risk appetite can spill into commodity currencies as a group.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "LONDON, March 2025 \u2013 The GBP/JPY currency pair, a key barometer of risk sentiment between the UK and Japan, approaches a decisive technical juncture. Recent price action suggests bullish momentum may encounter significant resistance near the 209.65 area, a level scrutinized by institutional traders and algorithmic systems worldwide. This analysis delves into the multifaceted charts, underlying economic drivers, and expert insights shaping the forecast for one of forex\u2019s most volatile major crosses.\nGBP/JPY Technical Landscape and the 209.65 Hurdle\nTechnical charts provide the primary framework for identifying the 209.65 resistance zone. This level is not arbitrary; it represents a convergence of several critical technical indicators. Firstly, it aligns with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the Q4 2024 swing high to the January 2025 low. Consequently, this area often acts as a final barrier before a potential full retracement. Furthermore, the weekly chart shows this zone previously acted as support in early 2024 before breaking down, a classic example of a former support level turning into resistance.\nMarket analysts frequently monitor volume profile data. Notably, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) from the last major decline anchors near this region. Additionally, the pair\u2019s 200-day simple moving average is descending toward 209.65, creating a potent technical confluence. Therefore, a clean break above this cluster requires substantial buying pressure, potentially fueled by a fundamental catalyst.\nChart Pattern Analysis and Momentum Indicators\nCurrently, the daily chart exhibits a structure of higher lows since the January bottom, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the same timeframe is approaching overbought territory above 65. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram shows bullish momentum but is decelerating as price nears the key zone. This divergence often precedes consolidation or reversal. For instance, a failure to break 209.65 could see a retest of immediate support near 206.80.\nFundamental Drivers Behind the GBP/JPY Pair\nBeyond the charts, the GBP/JPY forecast is intrinsically linked to divergent monetary policies and economic data. The Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remain on starkly different paths. The BoE, while having paused its hiking cycle, maintains a relatively hawkish stance compared to its G10 peers due to persistent services inflation. Conversely, the BoJ continues its ultra-accommodative policy, only gradually normalizing yields. This policy divergence typically supports a stronger Pound against the Yen.\nHowever, global risk sentiment acts as a powerful counterweight. The Japanese Yen traditionally strengthens during market stress as a safe-haven asset. Recent volatility in equity markets and geopolitical tensions have provided intermittent support for the Yen, capping the GBP/JPY\u2019s ascent. Upcoming data releases, including UK wage growth and Japan\u2019s Tokyo Core CPI, will be critical for near-term direction.\nExpert Analysis and Institutional Positioning\nSenior analysts from major investment banks highlight the significance of the 209.65 area. \u201cOur quantitative models flag 209.50-209.80 as a high-probability resistance band,\u201d notes a strategist from a leading European bank. \u201cOption markets show a dense concentration of gamma strikes here, which can suppress volatility and pin price action.\u201d Commitment of Traders (COT) reports indicate leveraged funds have built substantial net-long GBP positions. This crowded trade raises the risk of a sharp unwind if resistance holds, potentially triggering a swift corrective move.\nHistorical Context and Comparative Performance\nUnderstanding the current GBP/JPY forecast requires historical perspective. The pair has traded within a broad range of 180 to 210 over the past five years. A break above 210 would open the path to levels not seen since 2015. The tabl"

Ultimately, the return of confidence, reflected through durable and sustainable capital inflows, is what matters most for the transitional phase.\nEther (ETH) was priced at US$2,054.76, up by 7 percent over the last 24 hours.\nAltcoin price update\n- XRP (XRP) was priced at US$1.41, up by 4.7 percent over 24 hours.\n- Solana (SOL) was trading at US$85.01, up by 10.2 percent over 24 hours.\nToday's crypto news to know\nCoinbase posts US$667 million Q4 loss\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) reported a fourth quarter net loss of US$667 million as falling crypto prices weighed on its revenue and the value of its investment portfolio. The company's revenue came in at US$1.78 billion, below analysts' expectations, making a 22 percent decline from a year earlier.\nThe firm attributed much of the loss to a US$718 million drop in portfolio value, largely unrealized, alongside weaker transaction activity. Shares slid ahead of the release and have fallen more than 55 percent over the past six months as cryptocurrencies retreated. Despite the surprise slide, CEO Brian Armstrong sought to reassure investors, saying the firm remains \u201cdeliberately well capitalized\u201d with US$11.3 billion in cash and equivalents.\nHe added that retail customers are largely holding rather than selling, even as volatility persists.\nBitcoin ETFs lose US$410 million\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs saw US$410 million in outflows on Thursday (February 12), extending a rocky stretch that has drained nearly US$1.5 billion over two weeks.\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) led the pullback, followed by Fidelity and Grayscale products, as institutional investors recalibrated positions amid macro uncertainty.\nTreasury chief pushes CLARITY Act as crypto selloff deepens\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent urged Congress to pass the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act this spring, arguing that it will provide stability to markets rattled by volatility.\nSpeaking on CNBC and later before the Senate Banking Committee, Bessent said the bill will give \u201cgreat comfort to the market,\u201d and warned that parts of the crypto industry are resisting what he called \u201cvery good regulation.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be a nihilist group in the industry who prefers no regulation over this very good regulation,\u201d he told lawmakers, drawing support from Senator Mark Warner.\nThe legislation has stalled amid disputes over stablecoin yield, DeFi oversight and token classifications, with critics \u2014 including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 raising objections.

Source: TradingView (Altcoin Sherpa)\nThe TradingView chart, created at 22:38 UTC on Feb. 12, showed $SOL breaking below a prior floor near $95. As a result, that zone now acts as resistance. Price also moved well below the 200-day exponential moving average, which sat near $121 on the chart. The loss of that moving average confirms that price remains in a broader downtrend on the higher timeframe. In addition, the latest candle printed a long downside wick, which signals sharp intraday selling pressure before a partial rebound.\nThe structure on the chart shows that the $95 area previously acted as support during multiple pullbacks in 2024 and early 2025. However, once price closed below that level, buyers failed to reclaim it on the rebound. Therefore, the market now treats the former floor as overhead resistance. Below the current price, the next marked support zone sits near the high-$70s, followed by a lower band around $51. That lower level aligns with Altcoin Sherpa\u2019s comment that Solana could move toward $50 if the current support fails to hold.\nThe analyst framed the level as a critical line for market structure rather than a short-term target. In earlier cycles, similar breaks of multi-month support zones led to extended downside phases before price found a stable base. Meanwhile, volume on the chart increased during the breakdown, which shows stronger participation on the sell side. As a result, the move reflects broader weakness rather than a brief volatility spike.\nSolana Sensei cites new high in $SOL locked across DeFi\nMeanwhile, A crypto commentator posting as Solana Sensei said on X that Solana has reached a new all time high in $SOL locked across decentralized finance, pointing to a DeFiLlama chart that tracks total value locked denominated in $SOL. The post argued that users are accumulating $SOL and using it onchain, linking the rise in locked tokens to higher activity across Solana based DeFi.\nSolana DeFi TVL in $SOL Chart. Source: DeFiLlama (Solana Sensei)\nThe chart shows $SOL denominated TVL climbing through 2024 and 2025, then pushing to a fresh peak in early 2026. On the y axis, the metric ranges up to 100 million $SOL, while the latest reading sits near the top of the scale, around the high 70 million to roughly 80 million $SOL area. That level exceeds the earlier cycle peaks visible in 2021 and 2022, when the metric rose sharply before dropping into 2023.\nBecause the chart measures TVL in $SOL rather than dollars, the increase can reflect more tokens deposited into DeFi protocols, not only price moves. As a result, the new high suggests that more $SOL units sit inside DeFi apps than at prior peaks. However, the chart alone does not separate deposits from shifts in how protocols count locked assets, so the figure still needs protocol level context to explain what drove the jump."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 48.95 points, or 0.10%, and settled at 49,500.93.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index \u2014 which measures the costs for goods and services in the U.S. economy \u2014 rose 0.2% in January, reflecting a gain of 2.4% on an annualized basis. The inflation gauge was expected to show a 0.3% increase on a month-over-month basis and a 2.5% advance from a year earlier, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.\nWhen excluding volatile food and energy prices, core CPI came in line with expectations at 0.3% on the month and 2.5% year over year.\n\"This should be welcome news for markets, and the presumptive incoming Fed Chair Kevin Warsh,\" said Phil Blancato, Osaic chief market strategist. \"This is only one month's worth of data, but if the trend continues it should pave a path for lower interest rates and reined in inflation.\"\nInflation is also \"not unrelated\" to existing fears among investors that artificial intelligence will disrupt revenue potential in various industries, according to Keith Buchanan of Globalt Investments. While Friday's CPI print \"has nothing to do with what we're anticipating\" as far as industry disruption goes, the market is still trying to figure out what AI and its implementation throughout the economy really means, he said, noting that it's creating \"upward pressure on unemployment\" as well as \"downward pressure on inflation.\"\n\"How do we think that everyone was going to win and there wouldn't be a loser?\" the senior portfolio manager told CNBC.\nAI disruption fears rattled the market this week, spreading beyond the sell-off seen in software and into real estate, trucking and financial services. Financial stocks Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley fell 10.8% and 4.9% this week, respectively, while software stock Workday dropped 11% in the period. Shares of commercial real estate firm CBRE lost 16% week to date.\nThose fears widened to the media industry as well, hitting Walt Disney and Netflix. Disney shares added about 3% on the week, while Netflix shares tumbled 6%.\n\"Investors show no mercy for anything seen as an AI loser. The list is growing by the day, driving divergence between new/old economy sectors and U.S./[Rest Of World] equities,\" said Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau. \"Amid erratic price action and fears of AI disruption turning into a broader macro/credit issue, growth, rates & earnings backdrop is okay.\"\nThe major averages all posted declines for the week, with the S&P 500 sliding 1.4% and posting its second consecutive losing week. The Dow dropped 1.2%, and the Nasdaq notched a 2.1% decline."

The recovery followed Thursday's punishing 669-point selloff that was driven by fears of AI-led disruption across software, trucking, and real estate sectors. The S&P 500 edged higher, while the Nasdaq Composite traded mixed as investors digested a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report alongside a flood of after-hours earnings. Despite Friday's bounce, all three major indexes remain on pace for weekly losses, with the S&P 500 tracking its worst week since November.\nJanuary inflation report undercuts hawkish rate expectations\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the CPI rose 0.2% MoM in January, below the 0.3% consensus estimate. On a year-over-year basis, headline CPI came in at 2.4%, undershooting the 2.5% forecast and marking a meaningful deceleration from December's 2.7% reading. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, printed in line at 0.3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. The softer-than-expected headline figures immediately reshuffled rate cut expectations. The CME FedWatch Tool showed the probability of a first Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in June surging to approximately 83%, up dramatically from below 50% just two days earlier, when the better-than-expected January Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report of 130K jobs had pushed traders toward a \"higher for longer\" stance. Money markets are now pricing in around 63 basis points of Fed rate reductions for 2026, equivalent to roughly a 50% chance of a third cut by December. The data carries extra weight as markets await the Fed's leadership transition, with incoming Chair Kevin Warsh expected to take the reins from Jerome Powell in May.\nAI infrastructure demand lifts Applied Materials, Rivian soars on delivery outlook\nApplied Materials (AMAT) surged roughly 12% after delivering a first-quarter earnings beat driven by accelerating semiconductor equipment demand tied to the AI buildout. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.38 on revenue of $7.01 billion, both well above the consensus estimates of $2.20 and $6.87 billion, respectively. The company guided its semiconductor equipment business to expand by over 20% this calendar year. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) rocketed more than 20% after posting narrower-than-expected losses and issuing 2026 delivery guidance of 62K to 67K vehicles, representing growth of 47% to 59% versus 2025. Roku (ROKU) gained around 10% on a fourth-quarter earnings beat and bullish 2026 guidance of $5.5 billion in revenue, well above the $5.34 billion consensus.\nPinterest and DraftKings tumble on soft guidance\nOn the losing side, Pinterest (PINS) plunged over 20% after posting disappointing fourth-quarter results and guiding first-quarter revenue of $951 million to $971 million, missing the $981 million consensus. Baird downgraded the stock to neutral, citing advertiser headwinds. DraftKings (DKNG) cratered roughly 17% after its 2026 revenue guidance of $6.5 billion to $6.9 billion came in far below the $7.31 billion Wall Street estimate, despite a fourth-quarter EPS beat. The earnings miss highlights the growing divergence between AI-linked hardware names, which continue to benefit from infrastructure spending, and consumer-facing platforms struggling with advertising softness and competitive pressures.\nDow Jones technicals\nThe DJIA opened "

This also marked a less significant increase than the 0.3% recorded in December.\nStuart Clark, portfolio manager at Quilter, said the data \u201cpoints to some difficult decisions looming for the Federal Reserve in its rate-setting policy\u201d.\nThe US central bank voted to hold rates at its most recent meeting last month, but the easing inflation figures could mount pressure to cut at its next meeting on 18 March.\nIsaac Stell, investment manager at Wealth Club, noted: \u201cEconomic conditions in the US are currently showing signs of improvement in the form of solid GDP growth and a stabilising labour market. These latest positive inflation figures mean that if the disinflation trend continues, policymakers are likely to ease rates as 2026 progresses.\u201d\nHowever, Premier Miton Investors\u2019 CIO, Neil Birrell, cautioned that, \u201coverall, this will not change Fed policy, but it will ease the path towards a cut in rates sooner rather than later\u201d.\nThe CPI drop follows a difficult day on Wall Street on Thursday (12 February), after all major US indices fell.\nAccording to data from MarketWatch, the Nasdaq closed 2% down on Thursday while the S&P 500 fell 1.6%.\nBoth indices are trading marginally lower at the time of reporting, down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, explained that market jitters about AI disruption have caused dips in major US tech stocks.\n\u201cSentiment is proving hostage to the release of new AI-powered enterprise applications, and fear for now looks to be a greater driving force than rationality,\u201d said Nathan.\nThe FTSE 100 reached an intraday record of 10,536 today despite the latest ONS figures showing sluggish growth in the UK as US investment manager Nuveen's bid for Schroders lifted shares in asset and wealth managers.\nAt the time of reporting, London's blue-chip index was trading at 10,496.2, up 24.7 points or 0.2%, according to data from MarketWatch.\nUK GDP grew by an underwhelming 0.1% in the last three months of 2025 while the economy expanded by just 1.3% during 2025, undershooting forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nMeanwhile Schroders \u2013 one of the largest UK-listed asset managers \u2013 agreed to a \u00a39.9bn purchase from Nuveen, which would create a combined group with almost $2.5trn of assets under management across institutional and wealth divisions.\nSchroders' share price soared 28.7% to 588 points while among its FTSE 100 peers, M&G is up 0.3% and Legal & General is up 1.5%. St. James's Place, which was down 10% on Wednesday (11 February) due to AI disruption fears is up 0.9% at 1,266.\nSusannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club, said: \"This will go down as a week of huge upheaval for the UK asset management landscape, with this mega deal arriving just as valuations had taken a hit over worries about AI disruption.\n\"This takeover demonstrates the allure UK assets hold and has helped boost shares in other wealth managers and banks. There has also been a fair amount of bargain hunting after yesterday's dramatic falls.\"\nThe Schroders bid is the second tender for a FTSE firm this year after Swiss insurer Zurich made a \u00a37.7bn offer for British insurance conglomerate Beazley on 22 January, suggesting a surge in interest for UK assets.\n\"The mega takeover of Schroders by US institutional investor Nuveen demonstrates how overseas player"

Markets have been jumpy since late January as rapid AI product releases force investors to rethink who can defend margins and who gets undercut. That showed up in choppy sector moves: some rate-sensitive areas like insurers and banks have lagged this week, even as pockets of tech rallied. The mixed tape is the point \u2013 earnings updates matter, but the bigger..\ndriver right now is how each company fits into the AI and rates narrative.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Themes are moving prices faster than fundamentals.\nUK tech rebounded, while miners dragged as copper softened and heavyweights like Rio Tinto and Antofagasta fell. Even \u201cgood\u201d results didn\u2019t guarantee a pop: NatWest lifted profit and targets, yet the stock slid as investors treated the news as priced in. Defense also caught a bid on talk of a new multinational initiative, showing how quickly sector leadership can rotate when headlines validate a story.\nThe bigger picture: Soft growth keeps rate cuts on the table.\nWith the UK economy barely growing late last year, traders have refocused on when the BoE might start easing. Rate expectations matter most for banks, insurers, and housing-linked firms, because their earnings are tightly tied to borrowing costs. Add uncertainty ahead of November\u2019s budget, and UK assets are being tugged between global AI-driven repricing and a domestic economy that may need cheaper money to stay afloat.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

Instead of a clean breakout, we are seeing a choppy, nervous uptrend with explosive green days followed by sharp profit taking. The index is hovering in a crucial region where every ECB comment and every macro data print can flip the script from bullish confidence to risk-off panic in a heartbeat.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh YouTube deep dives on the DAX 40 setup\n- Scroll Instagram vibes on German stock market trends\n- Swipe through viral TikTok clips on DAX trading strategies\nThe Story: The current DAX story is a three-layer cocktail: ECB policy, a fragile German real economy, and global risk appetite shifting back and forth between the U.S. mega caps and undervalued Europe.\n1. ECB & Christine Lagarde: Why every word matters for the DAX\nThe European Central Bank sits at the core of the DAX narrative. After an aggressive hiking cycle to crush inflation, the ECB has pivoted into a more cautious stance. However, it is not in full-on dovish mode. Instead, the message is: inflation is cooling, but the job is not totally done, and cuts will be carefully timed rather than rushed.\nFor DAX traders, this is critical:\n- If the ECB signals a faster path to rate cuts, German blue chips usually catch a strong bid. Lower rates mean cheaper financing for industrials, autos, and real estate, plus higher risk appetite for equities in general.\n- If Christine Lagarde sounds hawkish, warning about sticky inflation, you often see a quick risk-off move: financials wobble, cyclicals pull back, and defensive names start to outperform.\nEuro vs. USD: The silent driver\nThe EUR/USD pair is another hidden lever. When the euro weakens against the dollar, big DAX exporters (think autos, industrials, chemicals) suddenly look more competitive on the global stage. A softer euro can act like a tailwind for earnings translated back into euros.\nOn the flip side, a stronger euro can be a headwind for export-heavy DAX components, especially when global demand is already patchy. That is why traders are obsessively watching every ECB press conference: the tone not only shifts bond yields, it also shifts the currency, which then spills directly into DAX earnings expectations.\nThe current regime feels like a balancing act: the ECB is trying to avoid killing what is left of European growth while still looking serious on inflation. For the DAX, that means volatility clusters around every meeting, every Lagarde Q&A, and every surprise inflation print.\n2. Sector Check: Autos under pressure, SAP and Siemens carrying the flag\nThe DAX is not a tech index like the Nasdaq; it is a real-economy-heavy mix with industrials, autos, and legacy champions. And right now, there is a clear split: the digital and automation names are trying to drag the index higher while the classic German auto titans are fighting structural and cyclical headwinds.\nGerman Autos: VW, BMW, Mercedes \u2013 from dream to drag?\nThe German auto industry is facing a brutal reality check:\n- Electric vehicle pressure: Global EV competition is intense, especially from Chinese manufacturers offering aggressive pricing and rapidly improving quality. Margins are under attack, and legacy players are stuck juggling combustion, hybrid, and EV lineups all at once.\n- Regulation & climate policy: Stricter emission rules and shifting consumer preferences are forcing heavy R&D spend.

German blue chips are trading like they know something big is coming: some sectors are quietly flexing strength, others are screaming distress.\nWe are in SAFE MODE: current price data from public sources is not confirmed for the target date, so instead of quoting exact levels, we are talking about the shape of the move \u2013 a market oscillating between cautious optimism and lurking downside risk.\nWant to see what people are saying?

ECB Policy: The Invisible Hand Moving the DAX\nThe core driver behind every sharp DAX move lately is not VW, SAP, or Siemens \u2013 it\u2019s Christine Lagarde and the ECB\u2019s rate path. When the market smells a softer ECB, German equities get a relief rally; when the tone turns hawkish or uncertain, the DAX quickly fades and sellers regain control.\nHere is the logic traders are gaming out:\n- Inflation vs. Growth: Inflation in the eurozone has cooled from the peak, but it is still sticky enough that the ECB cannot slam rates straight back to zero. At the same time, Germany \u2013 the engine of Europe \u2013 is flirting with stagnation, flirting with recession, and battling structurally higher energy costs compared to the U.S.\n- Higher-for-longer fear: If the ECB keeps policy tight for too long, it hits German exporters, real estate, and cyclical industrials. That translates into pressure on the DAX \u2013 especially on heavy industrials and banks.\n- Rate-cut hope: Any hint that the ECB is ready to cut earlier or faster than expected ignites a green rally. Growth names like tech and software (think SAP), and rate-sensitive segments like construction and smaller industrials, often lead those jumps.\n2. EUR/USD: The FX Lever That Quietly Moves German Stocks\nDAX traders ignore EUR/USD at their own risk. The currency move is basically a hidden earnings revision for German exporters.\n- Weak Euro = Tailwind: When the euro drifts weaker against the dollar, German exporters become more competitive in global markets and U.S. revenues translate into more euros. That\u2019s normally bullish for autos, industrial machinery, and chemicals.\n- Strong Euro = Headwind: A stronger euro tightens the screws on margins just when demand is already shaky. That amplifies every bad headline about China, global growth, or supply chain stress.\nRight now, sentiment around EUR/USD is stuck between \u201cthe worst is behind us\u201d and \u201cthere is no strong growth story to fuel a sustainable euro bull run.\u201d For the DAX, that means the currency is not providing a massive tailwind \u2013 but also not a catastrophic drag. Instead, short-term FX swings function as accelerators or brakes for intraday and weekly DAX moves whenever macro data hits the tape.\n3. Sector Check: Germany\u2019s Old Engine vs. Its New Powerhouses\nThe DAX is no longer just a pure industrial and auto index \u2013 but the old economy is still loud, and right now, it is struggling.\nAutos under pressure: VW, BMW, Mercedes\nThe German auto trio is figh"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full drama mode: after a strong run in previous months, the index is now stuck in a tense zone, swinging between determined German bulls and stubborn global bears. Instead of a clean trend, we are seeing choppy action with sharp pullbacks and aggressive rebounds, as the market tries to price in ECB policy, weak German industry data, and a slowly shifting global risk appetite. Think of it as a heavyweight boxing match at a crucial round: no clear knockout yet, but every punch is getting heavier.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns from top YouTube chartists\n- Scroll Instagram for the latest German stock market moodboard\n- Binge viral TikTok clips on DAX trading strategies\nThe Story: What is actually driving this DAX 40 rollercoaster right now? It all starts with the European Central Bank and filters down through the euro, German industry, and finally into the charts you are trading.\n1. ECB Policy, Lagarde, and the EUR/USD Domino Effect\nThe DAX is not just a German story; it is a leveraged play on ECB policy. Every press conference from Christine Lagarde is basically a live event for European equity traders.\nRight now, the ECB is stuck in a classic central bank dilemma:\n- Inflation has cooled from the extreme spikes, but core price pressures are still uncomfortable.\n- Growth in Europe, and especially in Germany, is fragile, with the economy flirting with stagnation and recession headlines never far away.\n- Politics are noisy, and fiscal support is not exactly generous.\nThat means the ECB is walking a tightrope: signal too much easing, and they risk a weaker euro and imported inflation; stay too hawkish, and they crush already-fragile manufacturing and consumer demand. This tug-of-war is key for DAX traders because of how it hits the EUR/USD:\n- If the ECB sounds dovish and the euro softens against the U.S. dollar, big German exporters (autos, industrials, chemicals) love it. A weaker euro makes their products cheaper abroad and fattens euro-denominated earnings.\n- If Lagarde leans hawkish or pushes back on aggressive rate-cut expectations, the euro can strengthen, which tightens financial conditions and pressures export-heavy DAX giants.\nThe result: every ECB meeting and even every off-hand comment is triggering fast algo-driven moves in the DAX, with traders trying to front-run the next pivot. The market is no longer trading just earnings; it is trading central bank psychology.\n2. Sector Check: Autos vs. Tech/Industrial Champions\nThe DAX is a strange beast: it is not a pure tech index like the Nasdaq, and it is not a sleepy value index either. It is a mash-up of old-school industrial power and new-school digital winners. Right now, there is a clear split on the battlefield.\nGerman Autos: The Struggle is Real\nNames like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are still global brands, but the narrative has shifted from proud leadership to nervous adaptation:\n- Electric vehicle competition from the U.S. and China is brutal. Chinese EVs are storming European markets with aggressive pricing.\n- Massive capex is needed for EV platforms, batteries, and software ecosystems, which compresses margins and spooks conservative investors.\n- Regulatory pressure on emissions and combustion engines is relentless, forcing huge strategic pivots.\nOn the charts, this translates into repeated relief rallies in the auto sector that often fade into profit taking. Autos frequently act as a drag whenever macro data disappoints or when China headlines turn negative. They are the high-beta pain t"

                "body": "Trump immigration sweeps upended L.A.\u2019s economy, with some businesses losing big\n-\nClick here to listen to this article - Share via\nThe first month of President Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles put a dent in the area\u2019s economy, costing business owners millions in lost revenue and exponentially more in lost output from workers, according to a new county report.\nThe survey found that 82% of businesses reported negative impacts from the raids that began early last June and 44% reported losses of greater than half their normal revenue. More than two-thirds of respondents said they had changed operations, such as by reducing hours and delaying expansion plans. Some said they had to close temporarily or had difficulty obtaining supplies and services from usual vendors.\nThe report was prepared jointly with the L.A. County Department of Economic Opportunity; researchers from a nonprofit group called the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation conducted an online survey of hundreds of local businesses.\nThe survey is the latest evidence that the raids upended parts of the Los Angeles economy as some residents here illegally went underground and employers lost workers amid the arrests. It\u2019s clear the immigration action hit some areas and sectors of the economy harder than others. Some communities were largely unaffected. But in immigrant communities such as downtown L.A., Boyle Heights and Santa Ana, merchants have reported impacts.\nThe report said some sectors, such as restaurants, construction and retail, would be particularly hard hit. But the authors said both employers and employees found innovative ways to keep going.\n\u201cHow these businesses are adapting, it\u2019s really a testament to their resilience,\u201d said Justin L. Adams, a senior economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.\nAccording to the report, released this week, undocumented workers contribute an estimated $253.9 billion in total economic output, equivalent to 17% of L.A. County\u2019s gross domestic product. These undocumented workers support over 1.06 million jobs and generate $80.4 billion in labor income across a range of industries, including construction, manufacturing, retail, and services, the report said.\nBut when masked agents with the Department of Homeland Security started roaming the Southland, targeting immigrants for deportation and arresting the activists and American citizens who followed them on their missions, businesses suffered as workers in the county\u2019s underground economy went into hiding.\nIn the first week of June alone, when the raids began in earnest and the National Guard was deployed into the city with active-duty Marines, researchers estimated that the nightly curfew downtown resulted in an estimated $840 million in economic output losses, according to the report.\nA UC Merced study used U.S. census data to track changes in the number of Californians reporting private sector employment across several months in 2025.\nAn analysis of L.A. Metro data, according to the report, showed that bus ridership on high-vulnerability transit lines around that time declined about 17,000 monthly riders compared with baseline levels.\n\u201cThe out-of-control ICE raids are doing senseless and catastrophic harm to our country, and we are seeing the toll,\u201d L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who lobbied to commission the report alongside Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, said in a statement.\nAdams, one of the authors of the report, said researchers partnered with the USC Equity Research Institute to create an updated, current estimate of undocumented workers in L.A. County, finding it to be about 948,700.\nWith the county\u2019s overall population at roughly 10 million, undocumented residents represent nearly 1 in 10 people, Adams noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sizable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to have a large economic impact on the county.\u201d\nThat businesses in the area have been hurt by raid-related disruptions is not necessarily surprising, Adams said"
