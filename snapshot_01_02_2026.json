Still, the tone was constructive across parts of Asia and in US futures, while Europe was mixed. The next leg for equities depends on whether 2025\u2019s AI-fueled rally can broaden out, because several strategists warn policy and macro uncertainty could keep volatility high. Rate-cut expectations are also in flux: traders are waiting on delayed US data and, for now, are penciling in littl..\ne chance of an immediate Federal Reserve cut but better odds by midyear. That tilt has weighed on the greenback after a weak 2025, while strong demand for precious metals suggests investors still want portfolio insurance.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A three-way tug-of-war is back.\nStocks are still leaning on AI leadership, which can look sturdy until earnings disappoint or valuations get questioned. Bonds and the dollar are tied to how quickly the Fed can actually ease, so upcoming data could reprice yields fast. Meanwhile, commodities are split: oil is only slightly higher after a rough 2025, but gold\u2019s resilience points to ongoing demand for hedges.\nThe bigger picture: Central bank credibility is part of the trade.\nInvestors don\u2019t just price inflation and growth \u2013 they price trust. The expected announcement of Jerome Powell\u2019s successor is another variable, because markets care about the Fed\u2019s perceived independence and competence. If that confidence wobbles, it can spill into the dollar, long-term yields, and the appeal of hard assets like gold.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "$5,000 Gold Is Coming \u2014 Don\u2019t Miss These 2 Top Gold Stocks\nBank of America just made a bold forecast. It says gold will reach $5,000 per ounce by 2026, a striking prediction that is fueled by a global rush into gold.\nCentral banks, particularly in China and India, are aggressively accumulating gold to diversify reserves as confidence in the U.S. dollar wanes amid rising U.S. debt concerns. Geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and escalating U.S.-China trade disputes, are also pushing investors toward gold as a safe-haven asset. Persistent inflation, despite cooling in some regions, continues to erode purchasing power, making gold an attractive hedge.\nExpectations of looser monetary policies, with the Federal Reserve signaling potential rate cuts later this year and into 2026, further bolster gold\u2019s appeal. Robust demand from exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors and physical buyers in Asia adds to the momentum. Gold\u2019s historic breakthrough above $4,300 per ounce last week -- a record high for the precious metal -- underscores the urgency behind the move. Gold is up 60% in 2025, far outpacing even the stock market's rise.\nThe two stocks below, with their strong fundamentals and leveraged exposure to gold\u2019s rise, are must-buy opportunities to capitalize on this unprecedented rally.\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM)\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is a premier gold miner positioned to thrive as gold climbs to $5,000. Operating in stable jurisdictions like Canada, Finland, and Mexico, AEM produces 3.4 million ounces annually, with ambitious plans to boost output through expansions like Detour Lake and Odyssey.\nThe miner's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $1,289 per ounce -- among the industry\u2019s lowest -- ensure massive margin expansion at higher gold prices. At $4,300 gold, AEM\u2019s free cash flow per share is robust at $4.50, but at $5,000, margins could exceed 60%, potentially doubling cash flow.\nEarlier this year, analysts at BMO Capital Markets resumed coverage of AEM with an outperform rating and a $181 per share price target at a time AEM was trading at $122 per share, citing Agnico's ability to generate significant free cash flow from high-margin, secure operations. Last week, Bank of America raised its price target to $226 per share.\nAdvertisement\nTrading at a forward P/E of 18x, below the sector average of 22x, AEM offers compelling value. Its strong balance sheet supports reinvestment in high-return projects and a growing dividend appealing to income-focused investors.\nUnlike peers in riskier regions, AEM\u2019s Tier 1 assets minimize geopolitical and operational disruptions, a critical edge in today\u2019s volatile world. Recent production upgrades, such as a 10% increase at its Nunavut operations, and a stellar environmental record enhance its reputation.\nAEM\u2019s disciplined cost management and exploration success, with new finds in Quebec, position it for sustained growth. As gold prices escalate, AEM\u2019s ability to deliver consistent results while scaling output makes it a top pick for investors seeking leveraged exposure to the gold rally.\nRoyal Gold (RGLD)\nRoyal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) offers a low-risk way to profit from gold\u2019s surge to $5,000 without mining challenges. As a streaming and royalty company, it funds miners upfront for discounted future gold, capturing 70% of price upside with zero operational costs. Its diversified portfolio spans over 50 producing assets, including Mount Milligan and Pueblo Viejo, generating around $600 million in EBITDA at current prices. At $5,000, RGLD's EBITDA could hit $1 billion, with cash flow per share of $8 rising 80%.\nAnalysts from CIBC and Bank of America recently boosted price targets, highlighting RGLD\u2019s low price-to-cash flow multiple. With minimal debt and a 1% dividend yield with consistent increases, RGLD suits conservative investors. Its fixed-cost streams ensure profitability even if gold prices dip, but at $5,000, margins soar.\nUnlike miners facing labor or permitting risks, RGLD"

On Monday, December 29, gold experienced its sharpest single-day decline in months, plummeting more than 4% to below $4,350 per ounce.\nThe dramatic selloff\u2014which saw prices drop nearly $200 in a single session\u2014was triggered by aggressive year-end profit-taking, increased margin requirements from CME Group (a 14% hike), and tentative progress in US-Ukraine peace talks that temporarily reduced safe-haven demand.\nPresident Trump's announcement that negotiations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had made significant progress weighed on prices, even as major uncertainties persist regarding control of the Donbas region.\nThe thin trading environment during the holiday period amplified the volatility, with reduced market depth meaning individual trades had greater price impact.\nBy December 30, gold had stabilised and recovered some ground, trading around $4,360-$4,370 per ounce as markets digested the correction.\nDespite the sharp pullback, the metal remains up more than 70% for the year and is on track for its strongest annual gain since 1979, supported by sustained central bank buying, persistent ETF inflows, and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nThe Return of the Western Investor\nAfter years of relative indifference, Western institutional capital has re-entered the gold market with force.\nTrading Economics reports that gold has surged 66-72% in 2025, with different measures showing the gain ranging from 66% to as high as 74"

The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined.

It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings.

                "body": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) says that Nigeria produced a total of 443.25 million barrels of crude oil between January and October 2025.\nAccording to crude oil and condensate production data from the NUPRC report, this translates to an average of about 1.46 million barrels per day.\nThe report noted that despite intermittent improvements, the output level meant that Africa\u2019s largest oil producer remained below its 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil quota set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) achieving about 97 per cent of the quota during the 10-month period.\nThe breakdown of the figures shows that January recorded the highest crude oil production during the period at 47.70 million barrels, while February was the weakest month at 41.02 million barrels.\nThe output recovered in March and April and remained relatively strong through May, June, and July before easing in August and September. Crude oil production in October stood at 43.44 million barrels.\nIn addition to crude oil, Nigeria produced 60.55 million barrels of condensate between January and October. This comprised 17.38 million barrels of blended condensate and 43.17 million barrels of unblended condensate, reflecting the growing role of condensates in supporting overall oil output.\nCombined crude oil and condensate production during the period amounted to 503.79 million barrels, equivalent to an average total oil production of about 1.66 million barrels per day.\nHowever, this performance fell short of the Federal Government\u2019s 2025 budget of oil production benchmark of over 2 million barrels per day, which covers both crude oil and condensate.\nAt an average of 1.66 million barrels per day, Nigeria underperformed the budget target by about 340,000 barrels per day, representing a shortfall of roughly 17 per cent, despite condensate volumes boosting headline production.\nData from the commission show that average daily oil production in October stood at 1.60 million barrels per day, comprising 1.40 million barrels per day of crude oil and about 196,000 barrels per day of condensate. This placed Nigeria\u2019s crude oil output for the month at 93 per cent of its OPEC allocation.\nThe continued gap between actual production and both OPEC and budget benchmarks has implications for government revenue and foreign exchange earnings, as crude oil exports remain a major source of fiscal funding for Nigeria.\nMeanwhile, the newly appointed Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum, Mrs Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, has pledged to reposition Nigeria\u2019s upstream oil and gas sector, boost investments, and raise oil and gas production.\nEyesan, who formally assumed office on Tuesday, December 23, 2025, following a handover from the immediate past Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, has outlined her vision during her first town hall meeting with the management and staff of the commission.\nGIK/APA"

Supply disruptions in Venezuela, where oil wells are being shut due to a partial US blockade, also lent support. However, upside momentum remained capped as concerns over global oversupply and mixed US inventory data offset geopolitical risk premiums.\nUS crude inventories excluding the SPR declined by 1.93 million barrels in the week ending December 26, significantly exceeding expectations. Despite this draw, overall commercial stocks remain comfortably above historical averages at 423 million barrels, underscoring a broadly oversupplied market. Adding to bearish undertones, gasoline and distillate inventories posted sharp builds, highlighting continued weakness in refined product demand. OPEC+ is widely expected to reaffirm its pause on production increases at its upcoming meeting, reflecting mounting evidence of excess supply. While OPEC reported a modest rise in November output, both OPEC and the IEA continue to project relatively resilient demand growth into 2026, with the IEA marginally narrowing its surplus outlook due to lower expected supply growth.\nFrom a technical perspective, the market is witnessing fresh buying interest, with open interest rising 5% to 18,244 alongside a \u20b910 price gain.

Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil pric"

Brent fell about 19% in 2025 and WTI nearly 20%, extending a multi-year losing streak for benchmarks.\nBNP Paribas commodities analyst Jason Ying expects Brent to dip to $55 in the first quarter before recovering to $60 for the rest of 2026. \u201cWe think U.S. shale producers were able to hedge at high levels,\u201d Ying said, referring to using derivatives to lock in future selling prices and keep production steady even if spot prices fall. Reuters\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s global oil strategist Martijn Rats said OPEC+ would likely respond with cuts only if prices fall substantially further, pointing to the low $50s as the area that could force the group\u2019s hand, according to Reuters.\nMost analysts expect a 2026 surplus, with estimates ranging from the International Energy Agency\u2019s 3.84 million barrels per day to Goldman Sachs\u2019 2 million bpd. A surplus means the world is pumping more oil each day than it consumes, swelling inventories and weighing on prices.\nOPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, paused output hikes for the first quarter of 2026 after releasing about 2.9 million bpd into the market since April, Reuters reported.\nU.S. data have also reinforced the market\u2019s focus on demand. The Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell by 1.9 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 26, while gasoline rose by 5.8 million barrels and distillates, including diesel and heating oil, climbed by 5 million barrels on strong refining runs. ( Reuters)\nIn the same report, \u201ctotal product supplied\u201d \u2014 a widely watched proxy for demand \u2014 dropped by 934,000 bpd to 19.38 million bpd, a decline that can signal softer consumption as the holiday period fades.\nGeopolitics remains the wild card, analysts said, even with the market leaning bearish on fundamentals. The United States imposed new sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector and targeted associated tankers, a move Washington said was part of an intensified pressure campaign on President Nicolas Maduro. ( Reuters)\nThe U.S. action followed a broader push against what officials call a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2014 older ships with opaque ownership and limited insurance that transport sanctioned oil \u2014 and came after a U.S. blockade announced earlier in December that Reuters said helped cut Venezuela\u2019s exports to about half of November levels.\nFor now, the tug-of-war is clear: surging supply expectations and swelling inventories point lower, while OPEC+ policy and sanctions-driven disruptions could keep a floor under prices.\nThe next test comes quickly. Traders will watch the Jan. 4 OPEC+ meeting and early-2026 demand signals for clues on whether Brent stabilizes near $60 \u2014 or slips toward the mid-$50s that some banks have penciled in."

                "body": "Asia stocks rise; Hong Kong, S.Korea lead gains as chipmakers rally\nEUR/USD steps into January 2026 trading roughly in the 1.17\u20131.18 band, finishing December around 1.1738\u20131.1763 after several failed attempts to sustain a break over the 1.1800 psychological barrier. At the start of December, the pair was sitting near 1.1585, so the market has added around 180\u2013200 pips in a single month and roughly 13% over the past year, off a trough near 1.0400 set twelve months ago. The pair is still in a clear bullish trend, but price is now pressed directly into multi year resistance where upside becomes harder and corrective moves inside the uptrend are more likely.\nOn the Federal Reserve side, the framework for USD is simple: the easing cycle has started, but the committee is divided on how far to go. In December, the Fed delivered its third 25 basis point cut of 2025, bringing the federal funds range down to 3.50%\u20133.75%. That range is now described as roughly neutral rather than overtly restrictive, and the latest dot plot shows a wide distribution of views on the 2026 path, not a tight cluster.\nFutures markets currently price roughly two additional cuts in 2026, with around 60% probability attached to a move at the 26 March meeting and roughly 77% odds that the Fed reduces rates at least twice during the year. The chance of a cut as early as January is closer to 15%, which is why the USD has weakened on a structural basis but has not collapsed outright.\nThe division inside the committee is material. One group pushed for a larger, \u201cjumbo\u201d cut at the last decision, while another bloc preferred no change at all. That split matters for EUR/USD because every labour and inflation print now has the power to swing expectations. Weekly jobless claims most recently came in at 199K versus forecasts around 219K and a prior reading of 215K, signalling that the labour market is still tighter than what a deep cutting cycle would normally justify. At the same time, the Fed is openly willing to live with inflation above 2% for longer. The net result is a structural bias toward a weaker USD into 2026, interrupted by sharp counter trend rallies whenever US data surprises on the strong side.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) sits near 98.25, not far below a recent swing high around 100.40 yet still on track to finish the year with a decline of roughly 10%, its softest annual performance in about eight years. Technically, DXY is boxed between its 50 day exponential moving average near 98.10 and the 200 day exponential moving average in the 98.60 area. Immediate resistance sits at 98.36, with the next cap around 98.74. The RSI just under 60 points to moderate positive momentum, but not an overbought regime.\nA decisive push through 98.74 would confirm that the dollar has built a short term floor and could drive EUR/USD back towards the low 1.17s, with scope to test the 1.16 handle if the move extends. On the other side, a clean break under 98.00 on DXY would reopen a path for EUR/USD to attack and eventually surpass the 1.1800\u20131.1840 resistance zone. For now, the index structure argues for a choppy, two way market rather than a one directional collapse in the greenback.\nThe European Central Bank provides the second leg of the divergence that matters for EUR/USD. The ECB closed 2025 with policy rates unchanged and staff projections that keep inflation hovering near 2% through 2028. The forecast for 2026 inflation was nudged about 20 basis points higher, but still effectively sits on target, which signals that policymakers are broadly comfortable with the current stance. Growth projections for the euro area saw a modest upward tweak, and communication stressed that domestic demand \u2014 helped by higher infrastructure and defence spending \u2014 is expected to be the main growth engine in coming years.\nMoney markets assign less than a 10% probability to a 25 basis point cut by February 2026, meaning investors do not expect the ECB to shadow the Fed down the easing path in the "

Traders will likely observe Germany\u2019s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data later in the day.\nThe Euro (EUR) is finding support against the US Dollar (USD) as monetary policy paths diverge between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The ECB left interest rates unchanged in December and indicated they are likely to stay on hold for an extended period. ECB President Christine Lagarde highlighted that elevated uncertainty makes it challenging to provide clear forward guidance on future policy moves.\nThe EUR/USD pair gains ground as the US Dollar struggles amid expectations of two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, which would narrow interest-rate differentials with other major central banks. Markets are bracing for US President Donald Trump to nominate a new Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, a move that could tilt monetary policy toward lower interest rates.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows an 85.1% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 84.5% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 14.9% from 15.5% a week ago.\nThe Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the"

                "body": "EUR/USD has risen above 1.1750, trading around 1.1760 during Friday\u2019s Asian session. Market participants are watching Germany\u2019s Manufacturing PMI data closely.\nThe Euro is benefiting from policy differences between the ECB, which has maintained steady rates, and the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut rates by 2026. A new Fed chair could influence lower US interest rates.\nProbability Of Unchanged Rates\nThe FedWatch tool indicates an 85.1% probability of unchanged rates at the upcoming Fed meeting, with the likelihood of a rate cut dropping to 14.9%. The Fed lowered rates by 25 bps in December, setting the target range at 3.50%\u20133.75%.\nThe Euro is the official currency of 20 EU countries. In 2022, it represented 31% of global forex transactions with an average daily turnover exceeding $2.2 trillion. EUR/USD is the most traded currency pair, making up about 30% of all transactions.\nThe European Central Bank influences the Euro through interest rates, aiming primarily at price stability. Inflation exceeding the ECB\u2019s 2% target may prompt rate hikes. Economic indicators like GDP and PMIs, along with trade balance data, play a role in determining the Euro\u2019s value.\nGiven the widening policy gap between a steady European Central Bank and a dovish Federal Reserve, we see the path of least resistance for EUR/USD as upward in the near term. The primary trade is to position for further Euro strength against the US Dollar. Derivative traders should consider buying EUR/USD call options or implementing bull call spreads to capitalize on this expected move.\nMarket Anticipation\nThe market\u2019s anticipation of two more Fed rate cuts in 2026 is the key driver of dollar weakness. However, we must note that the December 2025 jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected gain of 216,000 non-farm payrolls, which could complicate the timing of the Fed\u2019s next move. This suggests that while the direction is down for US rates, the path may be volatile.\nOn the other side of the pair, the ECB\u2019s hesitation to cut rates is supported by recent inflation figures. Eurozone inflation, as measured by the HICP, unexpectedly accelerated to 2.9% in December 2025, reinforcing the central bank\u2019s cautious stance. This keeps Euro-denominated assets relatively attractive from a yield perspective.\nWhile the interest rate outlook favors the Euro, we are also monitoring signs of economic weakness in the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy. Germany\u2019s Manufacturing PMI has been in contraction territory, with a recent reading of 43.3 in late 2025. Another weak print could temper enthusiasm for the Euro and cap the rally in the EUR/USD pair.\nThis policy divergence is not new, and we can look to history as a guide for how such trends can play out. The period from 2014 to 2015 saw a similar, though inverse, divergence that led to a sustained trend in the currency pair. This precedent suggests the current environment could support a multi-month upward trajectory for EUR/USD."

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair reached around 1.3480 in early Friday\u2019s Asian session. Markets anticipate potential interest-rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, which could weaken the USD.\nThe US Dollar saw its steepest annual drop in eight years in 2025. A 15% likelihood of a rate cut by the Fed in January is noted, painting a contrasting US rate scenario from the UK\u2019s approach.\nFed Chair and Interest Rates\nUS President Trump suggests a preference for a dovish successor to Fed Chair Powell, intending to keep interest rates low. This adds to concerns about the Fed\u2019s independence in policy-making.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s gradual approach has lowered rates to 3.75%, their lowest in three years. Governor Andrew Bailey mentioned the likelihood of further reductions is uncertain for subsequent meetings.\nPound Sterling, the UK\u2019s currency, is traded globally and issued by the Bank of England. It ranks as the fourth most traded currency, with daily transactions averaging $630 billion in 2022.\nEconomic performance reports affecting GDP, PMIs, and employment can impact the Pound. Positive data strengthens GBP, while weak data might lead to a decline.\nTrade Balance and Currency Impact\nTrade Balance figures, measuring export-import discrepancies, influence the Pound\u2019s stability. A positive balance boosts currency demand, enhancing the Pound\u2019s value.\nWith GBP/USD firming above 1.3450, we see the primary driver as the anticipated weakness in the US Dollar. The recent non-farm payrolls report for December 2025, which added only 95,000 jobs against expectations of 150,000, reinforces the market\u2019s view that the Federal Reserve must cut rates soon. This puts downward pressure on the dollar, making the pound look more attractive in comparison.\nFor traders, this suggests positioning for further upside in GBP/USD in the near term. We believe buying February or March 2026 call options is a viable strategy to capitalize on this momentum while managing downside risk. Strike prices around the 1.3550 and 1.3600 levels appear attractive, given the current trend.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s more measured approach to rate cuts provides a solid floor for the pound. Unlike the US, where the latest Core PCE inflation reading for November 2025 fell to 2.8%, UK inflation remains stickier at 3.1%, giving the BoE less urgency to cut aggressively. This policy divergence is the key theme we are trading on.\nThe political uncertainty over the next Fed Chair is also a significant factor that could inject volatility into the market. This environment suggests that simply going long via futures might carry extra risk, making options-based strategies like bull call spreads potentially more suitable. These structures can help offset the rising cost of options due to higher implied volatility.\nLooking at the historical context, the dollar\u2019s sharp decline in 2025 was its worst since 2017, marking a significant shift in the trend. In past cycles where the Fed has pivoted this aggressively towards easing, the dollar has often remained weak for several quarters. We see the current setup as the beginning of a similar pattern for early 2026."

The comments are likely to heighten concerns among investors and policymakers about Fed independence.\nOn the other hand, the Bank of England (BoE) expects rates to continue on a gradual downward path, which provides some support to the Cable. The UK central bank reduced interest rates from 4.0% to 3.75% at its December policy meeting, the lowest level in nearly three years. Governor Andrew Bailey said during the press conference that rates are likely to continue on a gradual downward path, but \"how much further we go becomes a closer call\" with each cut.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces high"

Meanwhile, some Fed officials said it might be best to leave rates unchanged for a while after the committee made three rate reductions in 2025 to support the weakening labor market.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Aus"

                "body": "- The AUD/USD outlook remains strongly bullish amid the RBA\u2019s hawkish shift amid inflation pressure.\n- US dollar stays weak as Fed\u2019s new Chair appointment looms while expectations of two rate cuts in 2026 mount.\n- Technically, the pair is looking to move up beyond December highs of 0.6727.\nThe AUD/USD price begins 2026 with renewed bullish momentum as the RBA policy outlook shifts decisively back to inflation risk. A quarter ago, the consensus was built around further easing, but now the debate is whether the next move would be a hike. This has materially increased the appeal of the Australian dollar.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Australian dollar has responded positively to this shift in expectations, climbing toward 0.6700 and trading near 14-month highs, supported by growing confidence that Australia\u2019s policy path may soon diverge further from that of the United States. The Aussie finished 2025 up nearly 8%, the strongest annual performance since 2020.\nUpbeat GDP and CPI, combined with a resilient labor market despite a rise in unemployment, have prompted the RBA to hold a hawkish stance in December. Money markets consider this the end of the easing cycle, following three cuts, with the cash rate remaining at 3.6%. With the risk of reigniting inflationary pressures, market participants are eyeing Q4 CPI as a potential policy catalyst.\nQ4 inflation could surprise to the upside, as the trimmed mean inflation is already around the upper limit of the RBA\u2019s target band. A stronger figure would cement the odds of a 25 bps rate hike in the Feb 03 meeting. Although the RBA left no signal for imminent tightening, the December minutes revealed clear conditions that required higher rates.\nIt is important to note that the central bank may not initiate an aggressive hiking cycle as the unemployment trend is expected to remain slightly higher through 2026. Under such conditions, one hike could push the cash rate to 3.85% followed by an extended hold until inflationary pressure cools.\nAcross the Pacific, the US dollar remains weak amid uncertainty surrounding the new Fed Chair and concerns about the Fed\u2019s autonomy under the Trump administration. Moreover, markets anticipate two rate cuts in 2026, while recent FOMC minutes revealed a pause until inflation shows a clear downtrend.\nAUD/USD Technical Outlook: Bullish Momentum Above 20-MA\nThe AUD/USD price is wobbling near the 20-period MA around 0.6700 with eyes on the swing high area above 0.6720. The pair found solid support near the 100-period MA at 0.6660 on the last day of 2025.

Financial markets are pricing in nearly an 18.3% chance the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in January, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n(This story was corrected on January at 01:05 GMT to say, in the last paragraph, that the Fed cut rates three times in 2025, and traders anticipate two rate cuts this year, not next year)\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

This decline in the Yen comes as investors express frustration over the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) slow and measured approach to tightening monetary policy.\nDuring its December meeting, the Bank of Japan increased its policy rate to 0.75% from 0.50%, marking the highest level seen in three decades. Despite this move, the central bank refrained from outlining a clear timeline for additional rate hikes, leaving markets disappointed and putting further pressure on the Yen.\nMeanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement further interest rate reductions in 2026.

                "body": "Why Bank of Japan might wait until second half of 2026 to tighten again\nThe Bank of Japan aims to move its real rate closer to zero, but the timing and scale of future adjustments will depend on economic conditions. The market appears dissatisfied with the lack of clarity. With inflation expected to ease and USD/JPY strengthening toward 150, we view October as the most likely time for a rate hike. Recent data support our outlook\nTokyo inflation slowdown may prompt the BoJ to be cautious about raising rates\nHeadline Japanese inflation eased to 2.0% year on year in December, below expectations (vs 2.7% in November, 2.3% market consensus), mainly due to renewed energy subsidies, stable rice prices, and low petroleum costs. These factors are expected to keep inflation low into 2026, as the government increases winter energy subsidies, oil prices remain weak, and rice prices continue to fall. Thus, headline inflation is expected to drop below 2% in the coming months.\nMeanwhile, core inflation, excluding fresh food and energy prices, slowed to 2.6% (vs 2.8% in November, market consensus). Goods prices declined while private services and housing prices showed steady gains in December. Going forward, we expect core inflation to decelerate toward 2%, mainly due to base effects.\nWith headline inflation expected to drop below 2.0%, and core inflation easing toward 2.0%, the BoJ is likely to carefully assess the impact of previous rate hikes before considering any further hikes. Once the BoJ confirms that core inflation will remain above 2% and outpace headline inflation, it will likely take the next step sometime in the second half of 2026. We believe that strong wage growth and government aid will keep core inflation above 2%. Notably, major labour unions have detailed plans to pursue wage growth of over 5%. Strong corporate earnings are likely to allow for solid wage growth. Also, the government's shopping voucher and cash payout programmes are expected to stimulate private consumption.\nWe expect USD/JPY to appreciate modestly in the first half of 2026 as interest rate differentials between the US and Japan narrow. Yet if market concerns shift toward fiscal health -- unlike our base-case scenario -- and increased direct investment in the US further weakens the JPY, the timing of the BoJ hike could move forward to the second quarter.\nRice, energy, and public services will lower headline inflation in 2026\nManufacturing activity declined in November, but this is likely temporary\nProduction and shipments fell in November, likely pausing temporarily following previous solid gains. Industrial production declined a more than expected 2.6% month on month, seasonally adjusted, in November (vs 1.5% in October, -2.0% market consensus). This only partially offset the previous two-month gain. The most significant drop was in auto production, which fell 7.2%, the first decline in four months. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 0.6% MoM in December, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Major categories such as general merchandise, apparel, and food and beverages all gained ground. Auto sales were weak, down 2.6%, but we believe this is a temporary decline following a sharp 9.6% gain in October.\nWe expect GDP to rebound 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, annualised, in the fourth quarter, after a 2.3% contraction in the third quarter, led by private consumption and investment. We are concerned that the sharp decline in Chinese tourists may lead to a deterioration in retail sales in December. So far, the negative impact has been quite limited. Also, winter bonuses are expected to increase sharply, boosting overall consumption. Equipment investment is expected to recover mostly in transportation and semiconductors; construction investment should rebound as safety measures related to one-off factors dissipate.\nThe BoJ meeting minutes showed the board adopted a more hawkish stance\nAccording to the BoJ\u2019s summary of opinions from its December meeting, some board "

The pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) loses ground over expectations of two more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.\nMarkets are bracing for US President Donald Trump to nominate a new Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, a move that could tilt monetary policy toward lower interest rates. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes indicated that most participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to stand on further rate cuts if inflation declined over time. Meanwhile, some Fed officials said it might be best to leave rates unchanged for a while after the committee made three rate reductions in 2025 to support the weakening labor market.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support as the recent Bank of Canada (BoC) communications indicated noncommittal on further tightening, with a growing bias toward holding rates. Statistics Canada reported a 0.3% contraction in real GDP in October, confirming that growth momentum cooled into Q4. S&P Global Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for December will be eyed later in the day.\nThe commodity-linked Canadian Dollar receives support against the US Dollar amid higher Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).

Traders are awaiting Sunday\u2019s virtual meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+), with expectations that the group will uphold its November decision to pause further production increases.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar.

This trend has been consistent since 2014, with each subsequent year generating significant positive returns.\nBitcoin\u2019s halvings reduce mining rewards by approximately half every four years, historically triggering bull runs due to the reduced issuance of new supply.\nExamining historical data, 2025 is the weakest post-halving performance on record in percentage terms, with no prior red yearly candle in these periods.\nMany declare the cycle \u201cofficially dead.\u201d The failure to sustain post-halving gains, combined with the absence of a \u201csupply shock\u201d rally, suggests that halvings matter less in an institutionalized market.\nOthers see it as maturation, not death. The halving\u2019s scarcity effect persists in the long term, but price dynamics are \u201cnot as automatic.\u201d\nConsolidation in 2025 could be a healthy correction in a longer bull market, with potential rebounds in 2026 driven by regulatory clarity and easing monetary policy.\nThe negative return trend breaks nearly a decade-old cycle, but it wasn\u2019t out of the blue; several factors contributed to the reversal of the trend.\nThe break of Bitcoin\u2019s trend indicates the classic retail-driven, hype-fueled 4-year pattern has evolved.\nThis means that future cycles may be longer, less volatile, and more aligned with macroeconomic trends.\nThis negative post-halving year doesn\u2019t invalidate Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals. The network\u2019s hash rate grew, and adoption increased, signaling a shift toward maturity.\nFor long-term investors, it may present opportunities for accumulation, while short-term traders should closely monitor macroeconomic cues."

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF fatigue is real, ignoring noise, these are the 10 days that mattered in 2025\nETF scoreboard 2025: We boil down a year of ETF noise to ten sessions when money actually moved.\nIf you followed Bitcoin ETFs day to day in 2025, you probably developed the same habit everyone did: you checked the print at night, read one sentence about \u201crisk-on\u201d or \u201crisk-off,\u201d then tried to map a clean story onto a messy market.\nThe problem is that daily flows are noisy by design. They're the residue of dozens of different motives that just happen to share the same wrapper: financial advisers rebalancing model portfolios, hedge funds adjusting basis trades, wealth platforms handling subscriptions and redemptions, and long-only allocators adding or trimming exposure because their investment committee finally met.\nSometimes the ETF tape tracks price, sometimes it tracks calendar mechanics, but sometimes it tracks nothing you can see on a price chart.\nSo a year-end scoreboard is a better way to read it. We isolated the days that actually moved the cumulative numbers and ask a simpler question: why did capital move in size on those sessions, and not on the 200 other trading days?\nUsing Farside\u2019s ETF data, the largest 2025 flow days cluster into two windows. One is early January, when flows were enormous and largely one-directional. The other is late February, when redemptions hit a peak and the tape briefly looked ugly.\nWhat follows is the clean version: five biggest inflow days and five biggest outflow days of 2025, with the number attached to every entry, then the real-world context that best explains why those numbers printed.\nWhy these were the \u201cbig\u201d days\nA quick note on language: the figures below are net daily flows (in US$m) across the US spot Bitcoin ETF complex. That means creations and redemptions have already been netted out across issuers.\nBig inflow days usually show up when one of two things happens:\n- price action becomes hard to ignore (under-exposure starts to feel career-risky), or\n- macro conditions stop being hostile enough to justify staying sidelined.\nBig outflow days tend to be the mirror image:\n- risk gets reduced abruptly (sometimes for macro reasons, sometimes for portfolio rules), or\n- an existing position is being unwound in a hurry (often because the original reason for holding it changed).\nThe five largest inflow days\n1. Oct. 6, 2025: +$1.21 billion \u2014 performance chasing, openly\nThis was the single largest net inflow day of the year. Bitcoin was already moving higher, momentum had flipped decisively positive, and the market narrative had shifted from hesitation to acceptance that the post-summer range was over.\nThe important detail is that this flow followed price strength rather than anticipating it. Institutions that had stayed light through months of chop finally acted once the breakout felt durable. ETFs became the default vehicle for that decision: liquid, regulated, and operationally simple.\nThis was not speculative enthusiasm. It was the cost of being under-exposed becoming too visible to ignore.\n2. Nov. 12, 2025: +$873 million \u2014 macro relief day\nThe second-largest inflow day arrived without fireworks. Bitcoin was firm but not vertical. What changed was the macro backdrop. Interest-rate expectations softened, broader risk markets steadied, and uncertainty that had lingered through early autumn eased.\nETF inflows that day were broad-based across issuers, pointing to asset-allocation decisions rather than fast directional trades. For many portfolios, this looked like a risk budget being reopened after weeks of caution.\nIn other words, Bitcoin ETFs absorbed capital when conditions felt manageable, not when headlines were loudest.\n3. Jan. 10, 2025: +$640 million \u2014 anniversary positioning\nEarly January brought one of the year\u2019s largest inflow sessions, tied loosely to the anniversary period of spot ETF approvals and the symbolic \u201cone year in\u201d framing around institutional Bitcoin access.\nPrice action was stable,"

                "body": "Crypto\u2019s 2026 investment playbook: Bitcoin, stablecoin infrastructure, tokenized assets\n2025 didn\u2019t unfold the way many cryptocurrency investors expected.\nAlthough Bitcoin (BTC) peaked almost precisely in line with its historical four-year cycle, the long-anticipated blow-off top never materialized. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s gains failed to cascade into the broader market, leaving hopes for a full-fledged altcoin season largely unfulfilled.\nAs a result, 2026 opens under a cloud of uncertainty. Investor sentiment is extremely negative, marked by caution and skepticism, even as the industry finds itself in an unprecedented position. For the first time in crypto\u2019s 15-year history, institutions, corporations and regulators are largely moving in the same direction, laying the groundwork for broader adoption rather than actively resisting it.\nAfter a year defined by unexpected outcomes, identifying the most compelling investment opportunities for 2026 is no simple task. Still, a persuasive case can be made for focusing on assets and sectors with durable, long-term relevance, rather than relying solely on the predictability of four-year market cycles tied to the Bitcoin halving.\nThere is also growing evidence that Bitcoin\u2019s market structure has evolved. Institutional capital, with longer time horizons and stricter mandates, is increasingly influencing price action and liquidity dynamics.\nIn doing so, these participants may be reshaping crypto market behavior, gradually shifting the narrative away from traditional drivers such as miners, long-term holders and Bitcoin whales.\nAgainst this backdrop, the following are three cryptocurrency investment themes worth watching in 2026.\nBitcoin: Will history repeat, or is the cycle breaking down?\nBitcoin is now deep into its fourth halving epoch, and historically, the period following each halving has coincided with the most aggressive phase of the bull market. In prior cycles, Bitcoin typically reached its peak roughly 12 to 18 months after the halving, a pattern that has long shaped investor expectations.\nIf history were to follow a familiar script, Bitcoin may have already marked its cycle high in October 2025, after climbing more than 600% from the 2022 lows.\nWhile such a move would be consistent with previous post-bear-market recoveries, it would still represent a comparatively modest gain relative to Bitcoin\u2019s explosive early-cycle rallies, and would reinforce the notion of diminishing returns as the asset matures.\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that past cycles still apply.\nAccording to Bitwise analysts Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen, Bitcoin may be on the cusp of breaking free from its long-standing four-year rhythm altogether.\nIn 2026, \u201cBitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs,\u201d they argued, pointing to structural shifts that are reshaping the market. In their view, traditional cycle drivers, such as halving-induced supply shocks, interest-rate volatility and highly leveraged speculative excess, carry less influence than they once did.\nWhile leverage remains a feature of crypto markets, its impact has diminished following a sharp deleveraging phase in late 2025, when a cascade of liquidations wiped out billions in open interest in October. That reset, they suggest, has reduced the probability of a classic blow-off top driven by excess speculation.\nMore importantly, Hougan and Rasmussen see institutional capital as the defining variable of the next phase. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked the opening salvo, but broader adoption may still lie ahead.\n\u201cThe wave of institutional capital that began entering the space in 2024 is likely to accelerate in 2026,\u201d they said, as major wealth platforms such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch expand access and begin allocating on behalf of clients.\nA more accommodative monetary backdrop could reinforce that trend.

The token is down 13% this year\u2014sliding from $2.09 at the start of the year to $1.88\u2014even after Ripple beat the SEC and XRP ETF inflows topped $1 billion. While XRP's (CRYPTO: XRP) 2025 performance outperformed Bitcoin (-18%) and Ethereum (-27%), the decline confused investors who expected gains from regulatory clarity and institutional validation.\nWhy did XRP fall despite major breakthroughs? Three factors explain the disconnect: macro headwinds overwhelming crypto markets, aggressive profit-taking after the $125 million SEC settlement, and stiff competition from faster blockchains. XRP's 2025 proved regulatory wins don't guarantee price gains in bear markets\u2014but 2026 could tell a different story.\nXRP 2025 Price Performance: From $2.09 to $3.40 Down to $1.88\nXRP's 2025 performance trajectory started with sky-high expectations. After ending 2024 around $0.50, pent-up demand and hopes for a U.S. spot XRP ETF approval fueled a massive rally. The token opened at roughly $2.09 in January 2025 and surged more than 60% to a 2025 peak above $3.40 in July\u2014with some intraday prints touching $3.65. By late July, XRP had gained over 580% from its bear-market lows.\nBut the rally didn't last. As macroeconomic headwinds grew and traders took profits, the XRP price decline accelerated steadily through autumn. Prices held around $2.15 in September, but the market broke lower when President Donald Trump's October tariff announcements triggered a broader flight from risk. By late November, the XRP price decline from its July highs reached roughly 40% and the token traded around $2.05. XRP now trades around $1.88, down about 13% in 2025.\nWhile negative returns disappointed investors expecting gains from Ripple\u2019s regulatory clarity and ETF launches, the XRP 2025 performance held up relatively well compared to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum suffered deeper losses as macro conditions deteriorated. XRP's 13% decline beat both major cryptocurrencies, showing resilience even as fundamental wins failed to produce the expected price appreciation.\nWhy XRP's SEC Settlement Failed to Boost Price in 2025\nA central narrative in XRP's 2025 performance was Ripple's lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In August 2025, the case ended when a federal judge approved a $125 million SEC settlement after both parties dismissed their appeals. The court affirmed that selling XRP on public exchanges does not constitute a securities sale, providing long-sought Ripple regulatory clarity. Many exchanges relisted the token, and bulls expected the price to surge.\nThe SEC settlement became a classic case of \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\" Investors who accumulated XRP expecting a favorable ruling took profits once it arrived. New buyers stayed away because macro conditions remained shaky. The SEC settlement resolved regulatory risk while leaving fundamental issues untouched\u2014competition from faster blockchains and slowing network usage remained.\nThe XRP price decline continued steadily after the court de"

                "body": "Sentora\u2019s tweet landed like a cold splash of water across DeFi feeds on Thursday: \u201cEthereum DeFi TVL remains dominant, and has become increasingly dominant last year. Do you expect this trend to hold, or could other chains start catching up?\u201d The chart he attached, a stacked share graphic from DeFiLlama, makes the point in one blunt visual: the blue representing Ethereum occupies far more of the picture than any other protocol family, and after the turbulence of 2021\u20132022, it has settled into a commanding share through 2023\u20132025.\nThat rise didn\u2019t happen by accident. Ethereum\u2019s advantage stems from deep liquidity, an entrenched developer ecosystem, and the network effects of composability: things built on Ethereum can easily interoperate with a vast array of smart contracts, wallets, oracles and tooling. When large pools of assets sit in a chain\u2019s protocols, market makers, yield aggregators and traders follow. Those flows, in turn, attract more builders and users, a virtuous circle that has been hard for rivals to break.\nThe chart suggests two important phases. Early on, many chains carved out slices of the total-value-locked pie as cheaper, faster alternatives to Ethereum appeared. But in the most recent year shown, the blue band expands again, implying capital reconsolidation on Ethereum and on Ethereum-native Layer 2s. That consolidation reflects a broader industry recalibration: where once many actors chased low fees, they increasingly prioritized liquidity and security, and those qualities still tend to live where the bulk of assets and developer attention are.\nStill, dominance on a chart is not inevitability in practice. Competing chains and Layer 2 networks are not standing still. A number of rollups and alternative smart-contract platforms have spent the last two years improving developer tools, growing ecosystems, and carving out niche use-cases. Some have succeeded in attracting liquidity through aggressive incentives or by offering differentiated UX for specific verticals like gaming, NFTs, or fast payments. The churn of innovators means market share can shift if users and builders decide the trade-offs are worth it.\nEthereum\u2019s Blue Wave\nWhich factors will determine whether other chains can catch up? Cost and speed matter, but so do composability and capital depth. A new chain can offer near-zero fees and fast finality, but without deep liquidity, its lending markets and AMMs will remain shallow. Bridges and cross-chain liquidity protocols can mitigate that, but bridges introduce their own security risks and fragmentation. Developers, too, weigh the familiarity of Ethereum tooling against the promise of emerging platforms; migration costs aren\u2019t only technical, they\u2019re social and economic.\nRegulatory clarity will also play a role. Institutional capital and risk-averse liquidity providers tend to favor environments that feel safer from a compliance perspective. If regulators make lines clearer, or if a rival network builds an easier onramp for fiat and institutions, that could accelerate change. Conversely, regulatory pressure on alternative chains could reinforce Ethereum\u2019s advantage if market participants see it as the safer default.\nLayer 2s complicate the narrative in an important way. Many of the gains depicted in the Ethereum band are as much about rollups and scaling solutions that sit on top of Ethereum as they are about the base chain itself. If Layer 2 adoption continues to accelerate, Ethereum\u2019s share of global DeFi TVL could persist even while users benefit from lower costs and faster transactions. In that sense, \u201cEthereum\u201d in the chart increasingly means the wider Ethereum stack, not only the base-layer transactions that gas fees reflect.\nSo will the trend hold? For the short-to-medium term, the safest bet is that Ethereum and its Layer 2 ecosystem will remain the gravitational center of DeFi. But the industry is dynamic: a chain that offers a superior user experience, solves for liquidity without undue c"

This isn\u2019t just about numbers\u2014it\u2019s about a seismic shift in the blockchain space, where Ethereum aims to become the ultimate \"world computer\" under the visionary guidance of co-founder Vitalik Buterin. But with fierce competition and critical challenges like scalability and sustainability looming large, can Ethereum cement its dominance? This deep dive unpacks the strategies, data, and expert insights shaping Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, revealing what this could mean for investors and why it matters to you right now.\nWhether you're a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just dipping your toes into decentralized finance, Ethereum's journey impacts your financial future more than you might think. From skyrocketing gas fees to groundbreaking upgrades, the stakes are high. Curious about where this could lead? Let\u2019s explore the roadmap that might just redefine the entire crypto landscape. For a deeper look into the numbers, check the AI analysis on Ethereum\u2019s current market position.\nEthereum\u2019s current standing in the crypto market is a tale of both triumph and tension. Priced at $2,991.5, it commands a market capitalization of $3.08 trillion and holds an 11.73% dominance, per CoinGecko figures. Yet, while Bitcoin towers over the market with a staggering 57.31% dominance and a price of $88,313, Ethereum\u2019s modest daily gain of 0.40% pales compared to altcoins like Cardano, which surged by nearly 7% in the same period. This disparity raises eyebrows about whether Ethereum can keep pace in a hyper-competitive space.\nRecent developments, however, signal that Ethereum isn\u2019t standing still. The full transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge has slashed its energy consumption by over 99%, according to Bloomberg reports, addressing long-standing sustainability critiques. Meanwhile, Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are gaining traction, promising to tackle the infamous gas fee problem. But with competitors like Solana offering lightning-fast transactions at a fraction of the cost, the pressure is on. Is Ethereum\u2019s market leadership at risk, or are these upgrades the game-changer investors have been waiting for?\nFor investors, Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory is a double-edged sword. On one hand, its position as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) makes it a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem\u2014over 60% of DeFi\u2019s total value locked resides on Ethereum, as per DeFiLlama stats. This entrenched dominance suggests a safe bet for long-term growth, especially as institutional interest in blockchain tech surges.\nOn the flip side, high gas fees and slower transaction speeds compared to rivals could deter smaller investors or push developers to alternatives like Solana or Cardano. If you\u2019re considering a position in ETH, now might be the time to weigh these risks against the potential of upcoming scalability fixes like sharding, expected to roll out in phases over the next few years. Staying ahead of the curve means keeping an eye on these milestones. Want a data-driven perspective? Get AI-powered insights on Ethereum\u2019s investment potential today.\nTo grasp Ethereum\u2019s current crossroads, we need to rewind to its inception. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a team of innovators, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling a universe of decentralized applications (dApps) that Bitcoin couldn\u2019t touch. This innovation sparked a revolution, birthing DeFi protocols and NFT market"

                "body": "The Solana ETF inflows have emerged as a notable phenomenon amidst a challenging crypto market landscape, where Bitcoin and Ethereum experience substantial outflows. On December 31, 2025, Solana spot ETFs registered a modest $2.29 million inflow, predominantly from the Bitwise BSOL product. While this influx may seem small, it symbolizes critical institutional interest in Solana, particularly as other cryptocurrencies struggle.\nThese inflows are significant because they promise to bolster liquidity within the Solana ecosystem, a necessary precondition for attracting more institutional players. As Solana cements its reputation as a high-performance blockchain, this burgeoning interest in its ETFs hints at an acknowledgment of its potential in tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. This recognition may also pave the way for innovative operational strategies among crypto companies, especially in locales like the UAE, where regulations are evolving.\nWhy do Solana's ETF inflows matter for crypto companies in the UAE?\nThe implications of Solana's ETF inflows could profoundly affect how crypto companies in the UAE strategize. With an uptick in institutional interest, these businesses may look to capitalize on increased liquidity and demand. The UAE's regulatory framework is becoming more accommodating towards cryptocurrencies, encouraging local firms to explore Solana's capabilities for tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure.\nGiven Solana's rapid transaction speeds and affordability, UAE firms might consider adopting Solana-based solutions for various applications, such as crypto payroll systems or payment platforms. This strategy could confer a competitive edge in the global market, especially for companies geared towards efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nMoreover, the uptick in Solana adoption could bolster a more robust ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within the UAE, positioning it as a leader in the crypto sector. Companies will need to adjust to these changes, navigating a shifting regulatory landscape while seeking new opportunities.\nWhat does Solana's performance reveal about institutional investment trends?\nThe performance of Solana, particularly regarding its ETF inflows, indicates a material shift in institutional investment inclinations. Historically dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the crypto market is now seeing growing interest in Solana as a high-performance blockchain. This trend suggests that institutions are diversifying their portfolios, venturing beyond mainstream players to investigate emerging technologies.\nThe recent inflows into Solana ETFs, coupled with a rising interest in tokenized RWAs and stablecoin infrastructure, underscore broader trends in institutional adoption. Predictions suggest that Solana might achieve notable price milestones in the coming years, fueled by network enhancements and growing technology acceptance. This diversification reflects a budding recognition of Solana's potential as a foundational layer for various financial applications.\nAdditionally, interest in Solana ETFs may imply a growing acceptance of crypto assets within traditional finance, potentially leading to more regulated investment vehicles. As institutions increasingly explore blockchain advantages, Solana's position in the market is likely to strengthen, further solidifying its status as a key player.\nIn what ways are stablecoin payroll solutions evolving within crypto?\nThe surge in Solana's ETF inflows aligns with a burgeoning interest in stablecoin payroll solutions, especially among fintech firms. Companies are striving to streamline payments and minimize transaction costs, with stablecoins like USDC and USDT gaining traction for payroll and invoicing purposes. This trend is particularly pertinent for SMBs eager to leverage cryptocurrency benefits without the volatility typically associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.\nStablecoin payroll solutions provide seve"

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL finds support at $120\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis confirmed a bullish sentiment as price rises to $125\n- The altcoin gained 2.44% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $120.\nAs of January 1, the Solana price analysis reveals a bullish market sentiment as the price rises to the $125 mark. SOL is now headed to the $130 mark where it faces resistance.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL holds above $120\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark before the bulls found support, enabling recovery. However, after failing to climb past $140 the price was headed down below $125 but finds support at $120 that has enabled recovery back to the $125 level where it faces resistance.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $131.32. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $119.03.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but leans close to the oversold level. The indicator\u2019s value has increased to index 45.05, and its upwards curve suggests a support forming at the level. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bullish activity as the bulls rise back above the $125 mark. The altcoin\u2019s price has declined to $125 after a short retracement from $127.\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $126.59, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $124.74, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 52.57 the RSI curve is pointing down, suggesting neutral market sentiment at the level. The curve on the indicator\u2019s graph indicates resistance from the selling side of the market at the current price level.

Behavioral heuristic scores hovered near 70%, reflecting moderate confidence levels among investors actively building positions in the ecosystem.\nSantiment shared five trending topics, with whale accumulation across Solana tokens ranking as the top trend on New Year's Day. The cryptocurrency-related social buzz focused on large wallet activity in the Solana ecosystem as 2026 began.\nThe second trending topic was New York City entering 2026 against a backdrop of political change, as newly elected mayor Zohran Mamdani made history by taking his oath of office on the Quran. Another widely discussed topic was the ongoing debate surrounding Strategy's Bitcoin accumulation, which continues to divide investors between those viewing it as long-term conviction and those concerned about balance-sheet risk after a volatile 2025.\nTraditional finance has also entered the conversation. Bitcoin skeptic Warren Buffett's official exit from Berkshire Hathaway after six decades has renewed discussions around legacy investment philosophies and their intersection with digital assets, particularly amid reports that the company's new leadership may hold a more favorable view of Bitcoin.\nDiscussions about tokenization and crypto's convergence with traditional finance are gaining steam elsewhere in the industry. Momentum from clearer regulation is expected to build further in 2026 and accelerate adoption, according to Coinbase head of investment research David Duong.\nDuong said 2025 laid the groundwork by expanding regulated access to crypto and pushing digital assets deeper into the financial infrastructure. Spot ETFs, corporate crypto treasuries, the rise of stablecoins, and tokenized assets are increasingly part of mainstream financial workflows.\nHe added that these trends are likely to compound next year as ETF approval timelines shorten, stablecoins gain a larger role in delivery-versus-payment systems, and tokenized collateral becomes more widely accepted in traditional transactions. The regulatory clarity emerging in 2025 pushed digital assets further into financial infrastructure, creating conditions for broader institutional participation."

With just $1.7 billion in assets, it's small enough to fly under the radar, yet its 24-year track record and roughly 4% dividend yield have kept it quietly relevant. The ETF recently trades around $99, up 3% year-to-date through mid-December, significantly trailing the broader market's double-digit gains. For income-focused investors, 2026 could mark a turning point if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle.\nThis infographic provides a concise overview of the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR), detailing its operational mechanics, most suitable use cases, and a balanced perspective of its pros and cons for potential investors.\nThe Rate Catalyst That Could Reshape REIT Valuations\nInterest rates are the single most important macro variable for RWR heading into 2026. Goldman Sachs Research (NYSE:GS) forecasts the Fed will deliver two more rate cuts next year, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3% to 3.25% from the current 3.75% to 4% range. Lower rates create a double benefit for REITs: they reduce borrowing costs for property acquisitions and development, directly improving cash flows, and make REIT dividend yields more attractive relative to Treasury bonds, potentially driving capital into the sector.\nMonitor the Fed's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections and post-meeting statements, typically released eight times per year following FOMC meetings. Pay particular attention to the dot plot, which shows individual policymakers' rate expectations. Any acceleration in cuts beyond Goldman's forecast could provide meaningful upside for RWR, while a pause or reversal would likely pressure share prices.\nAdvertisement\nWhat's Inside: Quality Holdings With Valuation Questions\nRWR's top two holdings reveal the micro-level dynamics at play. Welltower Inc (NYSE:WELL), the healthcare REIT comprising 11.5% of the portfolio, trades at 131x trailing earnings despite a 44% year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings. That premium valuation reflects investor optimism about aging demographics driving demand for senior housing, but leaves little room for disappointment. Meanwhile, Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD), the industrial logistics giant at 11% of assets, trades at a more reasonable 37x earnings with superior profit margins of 35%.\nThe dividend mechanics matter here. RWR's quarterly distributions fluctuate significantly, ranging from $0.61 to $0.99 per share in 2025 alone. This variability stems from the underlying REITs' own distribution schedules and amounts. Review RWR's quarterly fact sheet on State Street's website, typically updated within days of quarter-end, to track distribution trends and any shifts in sector allocations among the fund's diversified mix of healthcare, industrial, data center, and residential properties.\nA Larger Alternative With Lower Costs\nThe iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:USRT) offers a compelling comparison. With $3.3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of just 0.08% compared to RWR's 0.25%, USRT provides similar broad REIT exposure at one-third the cost. It holds nearly identical top positions, including Welltower and Prologis, but with slightly different weightings. The larger asset base also means tighter bid-ask spreads and better liquidity for investors trading larger positions.\nIf the Fed delivers on rate cuts and REIT fu"

US-China trade relations have improved since President Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October.\nNotably, Chinese rare earth exports to the US have rebounded since the meeting, suggesting the trade war truce may hold.\nThe Kobeissi Letter reported the latest trends in rare earth mineral exports to the US, stating:\n\u201cChina\u2019s total export volumes of rare-earth magnets fell 11% MoM in November, to 582 tonnes, bringing total 2025 shipments to 5,378 tonnes. Shipments over the last 2 months have been in line with the monthly average recorded in 2024. By comparison, in April and May, magnet supplies to the US were below 300 tonnes COMBINED after China imposed export restrictions in April. [\u2026] Overall, China\u2019s exports of rare-earth elements and related products, including magnets, jumped 13% MoM in November.\u201d\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions fueled speculation about multiple rate hikes, signaling a narrowing in US-Japan rate differentials. However, 10-year JGB yields eased back from the December 22 high of 2.1%, the highest since 1999. USD/JPY climbed 0.33% to 156.852 in morning trading, boosting demand for risk assets.\nSurging JGB yields and a sharp drop in USD/JPY could make yen carry trades unprofitable, leading to the sell-off of risk assets to repay yen-denominated debt.\nCrucially, hopes for Fed rate cuts in 2026 have bolstered demand for risk assets. US President Trump is expected to announce a new Fed Chair in January, who may be willing to stomach above-target inflation and favor lower interest rates.\nLower interest rates would reduce borrowing costs, boost corporate earnings, and raise equity valuations. Typically, Fed rate cuts would counter the effects of yen carry trade unwinds, watering down the longer-term impact of BoJ rate hikes.\nUS futures posted solid gains during the Asian morning session on Friday, January 2. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 148 points and 27 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini advanced 101 points.\nLater on Friday, traders should closely monitor the speeches of FOMC members, given the influence of the Fed\u2019s rate path on sentiment. Growing support for further monetary policy easing would counter yen carry trade unwind jitters, supporting bullish short- and medium-term outlooks for US stock futures.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut slipped from 48.7% on December 31 to 46.7% on January 2. Meanwhile, the chances of a cut in April or June stood at 57.8% and 81.9%, respectively.\nFriday\u2019s gains sent the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini further above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled a bullish short- to medium-term outlook, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on US data, Fed chatter, and BoJ commentary. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish on expectations of a Fed rate cut, alongside technicals.

Institute for Supply Management\nU.S. stock markets were closed on Thursday for New Year\u2019s Day, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average on hold after a late-year pullback. The Dow last closed down 303.77 points, or 0.63%, at 48,063.29 on Dec. 31, while the S&P 500 fell 0.74% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.76%.

Reuters\nWhy this matters now is simple: the holiday break hands investors a clean reset into January, when fresh economic data and company guidance can quickly reprice expectations for growth and interest rates. A strong 2026 for U.S. stocks will likely hinge on corporate profits holding up, the Federal Reserve staying on a rate-cut path, and sustained spending tied to artificial intelligence, Reuters analysis said. Reuters\nThe immediate question for traders is whether late-December weakness was routine profit-taking or the start of a broader rotation away from crowded positions. In the prior session, losses in financial stocks weighed on the Dow, while Meta Platforms rose after it said it would acquire Chinese-founded AI startup Manus, Reuters reported. Investors also digested Fed minutes that showed officials debated risks before agreeing to cut rates, with markets expecting the central bank to stand pat at its Jan. 27-28 meeting. Reuters\nThe Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced shares carry more influence on the index than lower-priced ones. That structure can concentrate day-to-day index moves in a handful of components, even when broader market performance looks steadier.\nBefore the next session, traders will be watching whether new-year buying shows up as liquidity returns on Friday, or whether the late-December slide extends. Round-number levels near 48,000 are often watched as a quick sentiment check after a holiday pause.\nEarly January\u2019s first major macro tests arrive next week. The Institute for Supply Management is due to release its December Manufacturing PMI at 10:00 a.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 5, followed by the Services PMI on Wednesday, Jan. 7. PMI, short for Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, is a survey-based gauge of business conditions; readings above 50 indicate expansion. Institute for Supply Management\nLabor and inflation data follow soon after. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 schedule shows the December U.S. employment report is due on Friday, Jan. 9, and the Consumer Price Index report is slated for Tuesday, Jan. 13, both at 8:30 a.m. ET. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nEarnings will quickly take over as the main driver for index-level moves. JPMorgan Chase said it will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results on Jan. 13, Goldman Sachs has set its fourth-quarter release for Jan. 15, and UnitedHealth Group plans to report on Jan. 27 and provide 2026 financial guidance. JPMorgan Chase\nThose early reports matter for the Dow because banks are a read on credit demand and trading conditions, while large health insurers often set the tone for managed-care pricing and medical-cost trends. Investors will be looking for guidance that either backs up or challenges expectations for profit growth into 2026.\nThe other watchpoint is whether market leadership broadens beyond mega-cap growth themes that dominated much of the prior rally. More balanced participation tends to make index gains more durable, while narrow leadership can leave markets vulnerable if a single theme stumbles.\nFor now, the Dow starts 2026 with a strong prior-year"

                "body": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Tactile Systems Technology (NASDAQ:TCMD). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\nHow Fast Is Tactile Systems Technology Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\nIn the last three years Tactile Systems Technology's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Tactile Systems Technology's EPS skyrocketed from US$0.65 to US$0.81, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a commendable gain of 25%.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Tactile Systems Technology achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.3% to US$312m. That's encouraging news for the company!\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Tactile Systems Technology's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\nAre Tactile Systems Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nIt's a necessity that company leaders act in the best interest of shareholders and so insider investment always comes as a reassurance to the market. So it is good to see that Tactile Systems Technology insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they hold US$13m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 2.1%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Tactile Systems Technology with market caps between US$400m and US$1.6b is about US$3.5m.\nTactile Systems Technology's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$1.3m in the year prior to December 2024. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\nIs Tactile Systems Technology Worth Keeping An Eye On?\nYou can't deny that Tactile Systems Technology has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. The overarching message here is that Tactile Systems Technology has underly"

Growth stocks tend to benefit when borrowing costs fall, but they can drop fast if rates rise or earnings expectations slip.\nStrategists say 2026 will test whether earnings growth can keep up with the optimism priced into mega-cap tech, even as futures markets point to at least two more quarter-point rate cuts this year. LSEG earnings research projects S&P 500 profit growth of more than 15% in 2026 after about a 13% rise in 2025, a backdrop that investors are using to justify still-high valuations. Reuters\nIn the final session of 2025, the Nasdaq fell 0.76% to 23,241.99, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.74% and the Dow slid 0.63%. Tech and energy were among the biggest S&P 500 sector decliners, and Microsoft fell 0.8%, as turnover sank to 11.17 billion shares versus a 15.8 billion-share daily average; a \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d \u2014 the typical late-December lift \u2014 failed to show up. \u201cThis is basically profit-taking and low liquidity,\u201d said Giuseppe Sette, co-founder and president of investment research firm Reflexivity. Reuters\nSector trackers told the same story. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) fell about 1% and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) slid about 1.2%, while the Invesco QQQ ETF \u2014 a basket that tracks the Nasdaq-100 \u2014 lost about 0.8%; ETFs are funds that trade like stocks and can serve as quick readouts on sectors.\nRate expectations stayed central. Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Dec. 9-10 meeting noted that market participants expected a 25-basis-point cut (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point) at that meeting, and options implied two additional cuts next year; the minutes also said Treasury yields rose slightly. Federal Reserve\nChip names also faced fresh supply-chain and policy cross-currents, a recurring driver for AI-related stocks. Nvidia has approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co about ramping up production of its H200 chips to meet demand from Chinese tech firms, Reuters reported, underscoring how export rules and regional demand are shaping the AI hardware cycle. Investing\nSeparate Reuters reporting said the United States granted TSMC an annual license to import U.S. chipmaking tools into China, replacing authorizations that expired at year-end, while a separate Reuters exclusive said Beijing has required chipmakers seeking approvals for new capacity to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for expansion. For investors, the mix of U.S. licenses and China\u2019s self-sufficiency push keeps the outlook for chip supply chains \u2014 and for equipment makers that sell into Asia \u2014 on the front burner. Reuters\nBefore the next U.S. session on Friday, traders will watch whether thin post-holiday flows extend the late-year pullback, or whether dip-buyers step back into mega-cap tech that led much of 2025\u2019s gains.\nThe first big macro test comes early next week. The ISM manufacturing PMI \u2014 a closely watched survey of factory activity \u2014 is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 5, according to Investing.com\u2019s economic calendar, and can move yields and rate expectations that feed directly into tech valuations. Investing\nThe following week brings higher-stakes reads. The U.S. employment report for December 2025 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, Jan. 9, and the CPI inflation report for December is due at 8:30"

                "body": "Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the City Holding Company (NASDAQ:CHCO) share price is 64% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. The 0.6% share price rise over the last year is decent, but not great.\nWhile the stock has fallen 4.0% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, City Holding achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.7% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 10% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on City Holding's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, City Holding's TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nCity Holding shareholders are up 3.4% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 14% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand City Holding better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for City Holding (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if City Holding might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

The organization points to language in its lease that states that timelines are \u201csubject to change due to compliance timeframes.\u201d National Links Trust is exploring the possibility of taking legal action.\nIn the notice of termination, the administration writes that National Links Trust has \u201cfailed to provide National Park Services with reasonable assurances that NLT has the necessary funding, ability, or plan to fulfill its capital-investment obligations.\u201d\nThe notice also states that National Links Trust may owe as much as $8.8 million in unpaid rent on the course properties. National Links Trust officials dispute the claim. The nonprofit\u2019s publicly available lease states that rent can be offset by capital improvements to the courses after a certain amount of rent has been paid. The National Park Service has approved those rent offsets, according to National Links Trust officials. The DOI and the National Park Service did not comment on National Links Trust\u2019s rent offsets.\nAdvertisement\nThe DOI said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe Trump administration prides itself on getting the job done for the American people and partnering with others who share that same goal.\u201d\nNational Links Trust has managed East Potomac Golf Links, Langston Golf Course and Rock Creek Park Golf since it was awarded the lease in 2020. Rock Creek Park Golf closed for renovations on Nov. 17. Founded by golf industry professionals Mike McCartin and Will Smith, the organization seeks to provide affordable, accessible public golf to the city and improve community resources that have long needed attention.\nAccording to National Links Trust\u2019s statement, it has invested $8.5 million in \u201ccapital improvement projects\u201d and more than doubled rounds played and course revenue since being awarded the long-term lease. Work to date has involved fundraising, tree removal and reviving East Potomac\u2019s putting course. Top golf course architects Gil Hanse, Tom Doak and Beau Welling have committed pro bono hours to direct restoration efforts.\nBut the wide-ranging project has now ceased, the Rock Creek Park renovations are suspended, and the future of public golf in the D.C. area is uncertain, with a pathway cleared for the president to take charge.\nRather than walk away from the courses immediately, National Links Trust plans to agree to a transition period with the administration. The organization will continue to operate East Potomac Golf Links and Langston Golf Course, honoring its miss"

(WKYT) - A Kentucky woman has been charged with fetal homicide after police say she told a clinic she aborted her pregnancy at home and buried the infant on her property.\nKentucky State Police arrested 35-year-old Melinda S. Spencer, of Campton, on charges of fetal homicide in the first degree, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence.\nThe investigation began Wednesday around 2:30 p.m. when Kentucky State Police Post 8 was contacted by a clinic in Campton. Clinic staff reported a woman had disclosed that she aborted her pregnancy at her residence on Flat Mary Road, according to police.\nTroopers and detectives interviewed Spencer at the clinic. Police said Spencer told detectives she had ordered medication online to complete an abortion. Spencer took the medication, which resulted in the death of a developed male infant, police said.\nSpencer then buried the infant on the back of her property in a shallow grave, according to police.\nTroopers and detectives responded to the 3700 block of Flat Mary Road, where they located the infant in a shallow grave as Spencer had described, police said.\nThe case remains under investigation. An autopsy is being performed in Frankfort to determine gestational age.\nWKYT reached out to Spencer for an interview, she said she was advised by her attorneys not to speak to media.\nKentucky has a near total ban on abortion.\nA doctor can only perform an abortion to prevent death or serious injury to the mother. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\nSome nearby states do have abortion access. In Ohio and Virginia there are some restrictions, including a ban after 20 weeks.\nAbortion is legal and protected in Illinois, with access guaranteed up to fetal viability.\nKentucky does not currently have a law that restricts traveling to another state for abortion care.\nCopyright 2026 WKYT.

This positive outlook is fueled by expectations that the government's ongoing stimulus initiatives will enhance company profits.\nAlthough the yield on the 10-year government bond may rise above 2.0 percent, experts believe this will have only a minor effect on stock prices. However, a significant risk remains: if the yen weakens too much against the U.S. dollar due to concerns about Japan's fiscal situation, it could negatively impact the market.\nThe Nikkei Stock Average is projected to approach 55,000, which would break the previous record closing high of 52,411.34 set in October, as continued economic growth supports further gains."
