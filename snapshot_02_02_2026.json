Markets were reassured by Warsh's experience in the central bank \u2014 he served between 2006 and 2011, a period marked by the Global Financial Crisis \u2014 and the perception that he won't always bend to Trump's will.\n\"Kevin Warsh's nomination for Fed Chair is exactly what markets were hoping for, as he's a steady hand, well known in market circles and is expected to maintain the independence of the central bank, which is critical for markets,\" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners.\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened following Trump's announcement, signaling the market's approval of Warsh's credibility and perceived autonomy.\nRisk assets, however, fell. On Friday, major U.S. indexes closed lower on the back of flagging tech stocks. Spot gold lost around 9% and spot silver \u2014 seen as safe-haven assets to hedge against U.S. volatility \u2014 plunged 31.4% for its worst day since March 1980 \u2014 with both precious metals continuing to fall across the weekend.\nCryptocurrency also plummeted, with bitcoin trading around $77,250, its lowest level since April, as of 7:45 a.m. Singapore time (6:45 p.m. ET).\nElsewhere, policy and politics are moving fast.\nIndia on Sunday unveiled its Union Budget for fiscal year 2026.

The decline in US futures prices and uptick in the dollar reflect the thinking that Warsh won\u2019t be a marionette for the Trump administration. It implies the chances of aggressive rate cuts in 2026 regardless of the backdrop, something which Trump has not been shy in calling for, are slimmer.\u201d\nDollar Gets a Boost\nAlthough lower interest rates tend to be positive for the gold price, the Warsh news seemed to be more positive for the U.S. dollar. It has weakened in recent weeks, but the U.S. dollar index which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, climbed 0.2% to 96.44 in early trading today.\nA stronger greenback tends to weigh on gold prices as this makes the precious metal, which is typically priced in dollars, more expensive for overseas buyers.\nIt could even mean the first crack in the remarkable rise of gold and related ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which has been driven by investors seeking a safe haven in uncertain economic and geopolitical times.\n\u201cTraders will be watching closely to see if this is a short-term correction or a more pronounced reversal of the big rally in these metals over recent times,\u201d Coatsworth said.\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, added: \u201cIn the short term, the correlation between gold and the dollar is strong, so as the dollar strengthens and the dollar \u2018debasement\u2019 trade gets scaled back, this could weigh on gold and silver prices.\u201d\nWhat are the Best Gold ETFs to Buy Now?\nWe have rounded up the best gold ETFs to buy now using our TipRanks comparison tool."

                "body": "Silver plummets after Trump taps Kevin Warsh to chair Federal Reserve\nThe price of silver plummeted Friday, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate economist Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve.\nSpot silver prices had dropped by more than 37% just before 5 p.m. ET, to around $84.63 a troy ounce. Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

                "body": "Gold, silver ETFs recover up to 10% after crash: Analysts say long-term outlook remains bullish\nGold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) made a partial recovery on February 2, after crashing sharply earlier during the day. Analysts have expressed belief in the long-term bullish outlook for the precious metals, despite current volatility.\nEdelweiss Silver ETF, which had hit the 20 percent lower circuit earlier during the day, recovered nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 232.17 apiece, as seen at 10.30 am. Axis Silver ETF, which also crashed 20 percent earlier during the day, also recovered around 10 percent to trade at Rs 231.85 apiece.\nGold ETFs, which were down up to 9 percent in the early trading hours, were down up to 5 percent, as seen at 10.40 am. It is important to note that despite the partial recovery, most of the ETFs are still in the deep red.\nGold, silver prices recover:\nGold futures with March expiry on MCX, which fell to Rs 1,40,001 per 10 grams earlier during the day, recovered nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,43,800 per 10 grams.\nSilver futures however are yet to show notable rebound from day\u2019s lows.\nWhy are gold, silver prices falling today?\nGold and silver ETFs, which earlier saw a significant surge along with the precious metals, have seen a significant decline recently, with the trend continuing today as well. The sharp fall in gold and silver prices came amid rampant profit-booking, along with stronger dollar. US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to head the American central bank.\nAdditionally, CME Group announced hikes in margins on its metal futures on Saturday and the changes are set to take effect after market close on Monday. This will also likely weigh on precious metals. COMEX gold futures margins have been raised from 6 percent to 8 percent, while COMEX 5000 silver futures are set to increase to 15 percent from 11 percent.\nHere's what analysts say:\nThe recent \"flash crash\" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of \"overbought\" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza.\nHe however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. \u201cRecord central bank buying, silver\u2019s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,\u201d said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The March contract expired on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude finished at $65.21 a barrel, down 21 cents or 0.32%.\nThe drop in prices came despite speculation that a supply glut in 2026 would push prices lower.\nThe eight producers \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria and Oman \u2014 raised production quotas by about 2.9 million barrels per day from April through December 2025, roughly 3% of global demand.\nIn November, they froze planned increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonally weaker consumption.\nSunday's brief meeting reaffirmed that decision for March, after earlier gatherings did the same for January and February.\nNo forward guidance\nSunday's statement made no mention of what OPEC+ could decide for specific months beyond March, and the lack of forward guidance is significant, said Jorge Leon, a former OPEC official who now works as head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\"With rising uncertainty around Iran and U.S. tensions, the group is keeping all options firmly on the table,\" he said.\n\"OPEC's own numbers point to a lower call on OPEC+ crude in the second quarter, which could limit the scope for production increases,\" Leon added.\nOPEC+ includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Russia and other allies. The full OPEC+ group accounts for about half of the world's oil.\nA separate OPEC+ panel, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, also met on Sunday. The JMMC does not have decision-making authority on production policy.\nThe JMMC stressed the importance of achieving full compliance with OPEC+ output agreements, according to a statement on OPEC's website.\nBoth sides signal willingness to talk\nU.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options on Iran that include targeted strikes against security forces and leaders, aiming to inspire protesters, multiple sources said on Thursday.\nWashington has imposed extensive sanctions on Tehran to choke off its oil revenue, a crucial source of state funding. Both the U.S. and Iran have since signalled willingness to engage in dialogue, but Tehran on Friday said its defense capabilities should not be included in any talks.\nOil prices have also been supported by supply losses in Kazakhstan, where the oil sector has suffered a series of disruptions in recent months. Kazakhstan said on Wednesday it was restarting the huge Tengiz oilfield in stages.\nThe eight countries plan to hold their next meeting on March 1 and the JMMC on April 5, the statements showed."

                "body": "OPEC+ agreed to keep its oil output unchanged for March at a meeting, the producer group said on Sunday, even after crude prices hit six-month highs on concern the U.S. could launch a military strike on OPEC member Iran.\nThe meeting of eight OPEC+ members comes as Brent crude futures settled at $70.69 a barrel, down 2 cents or 0.03%, on Friday, close to the six-month high of $71.89 it hit on Thursday. The March contract expired on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude finished at $65.21 a barrel, down 21 cents or 0.32%.\nThe drop in prices came despite speculation that a supply glut in 2026 would push prices lower.\nThe eight producers \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria and Oman \u2014 raised production quotas by about 2.9 million barrels per day from April through December 2025, roughly 3% of global demand.\nIn November, they froze planned increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonally weaker consumption.\nSunday's brief meeting reaffirmed that decision for March, after earlier gatherings did the same for January and February.\nNo forward guidance\nSunday's statement made no mention of what OPEC+ could decide for specific months beyond March, and the lack of forward guidance is significant, said Jorge Leon, a former OPEC official who now works as head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\"With rising uncertainty around Iran and U.S. tensions, the group is keeping all options firmly on the table,\" he said.\n\"OPEC's own numbers point to a lower call on OPEC+ crude in the second quarter, which could limit the scope for production increases,\" Leon added.\nOPEC+ includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Russia and other allies. The full OPEC+ group accounts for about half of the world's oil.\nA separate OPEC+ panel, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, also met on Sunday. The JMMC does not have decision-making authority on production policy.\nThe JMMC stressed the importance of achieving full compliance with OPEC+ output agreements, according to a statement on OPEC's website.\nBoth sides signal willingness to talk\nU.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options on Iran that include targeted strikes against security forces and leaders, aiming to inspire protesters, multiple sources said on Thursday.\nWashington has imposed extensive sanctions on Tehran to choke off its oil revenue, a crucial source of state funding. Both the U.S. and Iran have since signalled willingness to engage in dialogue, but Tehran on Friday said its defense capabilities should not be included in any talks.\nOil prices have also been supported by supply losses in Kazakhstan, where the oil sector has suffered a series of disruptions in recent months. Kazakhstan said on Wednesday it was restarting the huge Tengiz oilfield in stages.\nThe eight countries plan to hold their next meeting on March 1 and the JMMC on April 5, the statements showed."

They began easing the reductions in October 2025 through monthly 137,000-bpd increases, with December marking the third step in that process.\nBy the end of 2025, OPEC+ suspended planned hikes for February and March 2026 due to seasonal demand patterns, leaving the group with flexibility to pause, continue, or reverse the unwinding depending on market conditions.\nOPEC+, which supplies about 40% of the world\u2019s crude, continues to hold combined cuts of roughly 3.66 million bpd, according to its Secretariat.\nRead more: OPEC at 65: From Baghdad hall to global oil powerhouse"

However, the pair remains vulnerable to further downside as the US Dollar (USD) finds support following President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair. Markets interpreted the appointment as signaling a more disciplined and cautious approach to monetary easing, lifting long-end Treasury yields and weighing on rate-sensitive assets after January\u2019s strong rally.\nUS producer-side inflation firmed, moving further away from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and reinforcing the central bank\u2019s policy stance. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed PPI inflation holding steady at 3.0% year-over-year (YoY) in December, unchanged from November and above expectations for a moderation to 2.7%. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, accelerated to 3.3% YoY from 3.0%, defying forecasts for a decline to 2.9% and highlighting persistent upstream price pressures.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem noted that additional rate cuts are unnecessary at this stage, describing the current 3.50%\u20133.75% policy rate range as broadly neutral. Echoing this sentiment, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic called for patience, emphasizing that policy should remain somewhat restrictive.\nThe Greenback also gained traction as risk sentiment improved after the US Senate reached an agreement to advance a government funding package, thereby averting a shutdown, according to Politico.\nIn the Eurozone, the economy expanded by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to December 2025, matching the previous quarter\u2019s pace, according to Eurostat\u2019s preliminary estimate released Friday. GDP rose 1.4% YoY in Q4, unchanged from Q3 and exceeding expectations of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate edged lower to 6.2% in December from 6.3%.\nGermany\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% QoQ in Q4 2025, rebounding from flat growth in the third quarter, preliminary data from Destatis showed. This outperformed market expectations of 0.2%. On an annual basis, GDP increased by 0.4% YoY, up from 0.3% in Q3 and also above the 0.3% consensus forecast.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

The major currency pair faces selling pressure as the US Dollar (USD) trades firmly, following the nomination of former Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Kevin Warsh as the successor of current Chairman Jerome Powell.\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, clings to gains near the weekly high of 97.33.\nThere has been a significant positive impact of Warsh\u2019s appointment as the Fed\u2019s new Chairman on the US Dollar, given his historical preference for a strong US Dollar.\nThis week, the US Dollar is expected to trade highly volatile as a string of employment-related and ISM Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data are due for release, notably the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, which is scheduled for Friday.\nMeanwhile, the major trigger for the Euro (EUR) will be the preliminary Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for January, which will be published on Wednesday. The headline HICP is expected to come in lower at 1.7% on an annualized basis from the prior release of 1.9%. Signs of price pressures cooling down would boost expectations of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the near term.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing in new purchases. It is usually positive for the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days. Along with pursuing post-graduation "

Markets anticipate that Warsh may lean toward a smaller Fed balance sheet and hold the interest rate higher for longer, which provides some support to the USD and creates a headwind for the major pair.\nHotter-than-expected US producer price inflation might contribute to the US Dollar\u2019s upside, as it could further strengthen the case for the Fed to hold rates steady. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed on Friday that the US Producer Price Index (PPI) climbed 3.0% YoY in December, beating the forecast of 2.7%. On a monthly basis, the PPI rose 0.5% MoM in December, above the market consensus and the previous reading of 0.2%.\nOn the Cable front, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to cut the bank rate in December, the fourth quarter-point reduction of 2025. But most of its policymakers suggested the pace of rate cuts could slow. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to keep its benchmark rate at 3.75% on Thursday, with Governor Andrew Bailey and colleagues keeping their options open.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from"

                "body": "On Monday of last week the GBP/USD started out near the 1.36600 ratio, a jump higher after its close the prior weekend. The GBP/USD languished until Tuesday having trading within a typical range, with not much to write about except to say there were murmurs of nervousness in the broad markets.\nOn Tuesday the GBP/USD suddenly began bolting higher and by late in the day the 1.38700 vicinity was being challenged on a spike higher. People were looking for reasons to explain what happened.\nThe broad Forex market experienced similar lurches as USD centric weakness hit and financial institutions reacted like humans do with panic. Making news and supposedly the chief culprit of impetus was a reaction to President Trump\u2019s comment that he was not overly concerned by a weaker USD. However, after the highs attained in the GBP/USD and by other major currencies versus the USD in the middle of the week, some calm prevailed, and slightly lower ratios started to be traversed.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nU.S Federal Reserve and New Developments\nThe GBP/USD went into the U.S Fed FOMC meeting testing the 1.37700 to 1.37900 realms depending on what minute of the day it was. Volatility was certainly looming in Forex and traders were reacting fast. The Fed surprised no one when it remained cautious. The biggest question about the Fed\u2019s leadership however, did get an answer when President Trump put forward Kevin Marsh\u2019s name as the next Fed Chairman on late Thursday and Friday. This news confused the marketplace as analysts competed to be the first to be heard, while largely not saying anything insightful.\nOn Friday the GBP/USD traded around a high of 1.38700, this as Forex again showed volatility, but also signals that the USD was strengthening were developing. People who knew Kevin Marsh\u2019s history started to point out that he was an associate of Scott Bessent and could be seen as an independent thinker when it comes to interest rate policy. Clearly Kevin Marsh still has to be officially approved in order to run the Fed, so financial institutions that now have outlook may feel more comfortable as this coming week begins, but after the past couple of week this is saying a lot and there are no guarantees.\nEconomy and Influence in a USD Centric World\nThe downturn of the GBP/USD going into this weekend still left the currency pair within the higher elements of its one month, three and six months and longer price range.\n- In fact the GBP/USD is within values as of this weekend that it last traversed in the last week of June and into the first week of July 2025.\n- The GBP/USD must be treated carefully, along with the broad Forex market that is showing signs of volatile trading that have been missing for a long time.\n- Day traders need to make sure they are using solid risk taking tactics as they make decisions on short-term trends.\n- While many analysts tried to correlate the sudden weakness of the USD to economic data, trade agreements and fiscal policies, speculators should remember behavioral sentiment still moves largely on instinct and fear.\nGBP/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.35770 to 1.38110\nPicking a direction in the GBP/USD as the week begins for speculators without deep pockets is not going to suddenly become safe. Volatility is likely to remain part of the marketplace. Over the long-term some people believe the Federal Reserve will try to lower interest rates, President Trump would certainly like to see a lower Federal Funds Rate. The ability of the GBP/USD to gain since touching the 1.34000 vicinity on the 21st of January has been solid.\nThe upwards energy seen last week, including velocity, was dynamic. The results and new highs created by spikes however quickly evaporated, many traders who had big gains in their accounts \u2013 including experienced speculators \u2013 saw profits vanish as the GBP/USD reversed lower. Last week was a solid reminder to use price targets and be satisfied with gains and to cash out of the market whe"

                "body": "- The AUD/USD forecast edges to the downside despite a hotter inflation print as the yields fell sharply, suggesting only a single RBA hike in the near term.\n- Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair lifts the US dollar, as markets view the decision as less dovish.\n- COT positioning suggests reduced AUD longs, increasing odds for significant pullbacks.\nThe AUD/USD pair had a good start to the year, but it is clearly losing steam, trading well below recent highs around 0.7100. Strong domestic data has helped the Australian dollar, but positioning and external risks suggest it may not rise much in the near future.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Bitcoin price prediction? Check our detailed guide-\nAustralian labor market data surprised to the upside, while inflation remains sticky. Trimmed mean CPI is running at 3.3% year-on-year, still above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band and well above its November forecast of 2.7% by Q4. Markets currently price a 70-75% probability of a 25-bps rate hike at this week\u2019s RBA meeting, which would lift the cash rate to 3.85%.\nAll major banks now expect tightening, although views differ on whether this marks a one-off move or the start of a short extension to the cycle.\nHowever, market reaction to recent inflation data was telling. Australian three-year yields fell sharply after the CPI release, suggesting investors were positioned for an even hotter print. That raises the risk that a hike, if delivered, is treated as \u201cone and done.\u201d A surprise hold, even with hawkish guidance, would likely pressure AUD/USD in the short run.\nOn the other hand, the US dollar has rebounded following Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, a move markets interpret as less dovish than expected. This lowers expectations for short-term US rate cuts, in line with solid US PPI data and the Fed\u2019s cautious rhetoric. Asymmetric risk persists ahead of the ISM and NFP data. Any positive surprise could strengthen the dollar.\nMeanwhile, large speculators have flipped net long AUD for the first time since late 2024, according to CFTC data, with gross longs close to multi-year highs. This crowding increases pullback susceptibility.\nAUD/USD Technical Forecast: Wobbling Between 20 & 100 MAs\nThe AUD/USD 4-hour chart shows mild support near the order block at 0.6920, which aligns with the 50-period MA. However, the price is well below the 20-period MA near 0.7000, while the RSI has slipped below 50.0, suggesting a bearish bias.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nIn case of a bearish continuation, the pair needs a break below the 0.6920 area to find the next support at the 100-period MA near 0.6810. Conversely, the upside could face interim resistance around 0.6950 before 0.7000.\nLooking to trade forex now?

The upside of the pair could be limited as the Japanese Yen (JPY) remains calm following the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) January Summary of Opinions.\nBoJ Summary of Opinions suggested the risk of falling behind the curve has not risen materially, though timely policy execution is becoming more important. With real rates still deeply negative, members agreed that further rate hikes would be appropriate if the outlook for growth and inflation holds, while maintaining a gradual tightening path.\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated over the weekend that a weak Japanese Yen (JPY) could present significant opportunities for export-oriented industries and help cushion the automobile sector against the impact of US tariffs.\nThe pair could further gain ground as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground after President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair. Markets interpreted the Warsh\u2019s appointment as signaling a more disciplined and cautious approach to monetary easing.\nUS producer-side inflation firmed, moving further away from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and reinforcing the central bank\u2019s policy stance. US PPI inflation holds steady at 3.0% year-over-year (YoY) in December, unchanged from November and above expectations for a moderation to 2.7%. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, accelerated to 3.3% YoY from 3.0%, defying forecasts for a decline to 2.9% and highlighting persistent upstream price pressures.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said additional rate cuts are not warranted at this stage, characterizing the current 3.50%\u20133.75% policy rate range as broadly neutral. Similarly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic urged patience, arguing that monetary policy should remain modestly restrictive.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar Faruqui is a Forex Analyst based in New Delhi, I"

                "body": "USD/JPY took the spotlight in early trading on Monday, February 2. The Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions fueled speculation about a near-term rate hike, influencing yen demand.\nLast week, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upward revisions to quarterly GDP and inflation forecasts, and a hawkish Governor Kazuo Ueda, sent the USD/JPY pair to 152.092. It was the pair\u2019s lowest level since October.\nThe BoJ\u2019s policy stance and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026 continue to support a bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn February 2, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions from the January 2026 meeting indicated a more hawkish stance among policymakers, aligning with expectations of an H1 2026 rate hike.\nThere was a growing sense that the need for another interest hike was approaching. Policymakers cited concerns about inflationary pressures and yen depreciation. However, there were some calls to continue assessing the effects of current inflation levels on the economy and prices.\nUSD/JPY reacted to the Summary of Opinions, initially climbing to a high of 155.240 before falling to a low of 154.821. The pullback reflected rising bets on a rate hike before the summer.\nWhile the opinions were skewed toward the hawks, not all policymakers were aligned.\nIncoming Japanese economic indicators will be crucial to the short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY, given the BoJ\u2019s quarterly outlook report. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reaffirmed the Bank\u2019s commitment to continue raising interest rates if the economy and prices aligned with its projections.\nLast week, softer Tokyo inflation and weak retail sales figures cooled bets on an April BoJ rate hike, sending USD/JPY toward 155. The price action underscored the USD/JPY pair\u2019s sensitivity to incoming economic data and shifts in central banks\u2019 policy stances.\nLater on Monday, US economic indicators will fuel speculation about an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and demand for the US dollar.\nEconomists expect the ISM Manufacturing PMI to increase from 47.9 in December to 48.3 in January. A less marked contraction across the manufacturing sector would ease concerns about a sharp slowdown in US GDP growth, bolstering the US Dollar. However, traders should consider price and employment trends, considering the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\nSofter prices and falling employment would likely overshadow a pickup in sector activity, and raise expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed policy stance would weaken the US dollar and send USD/JPY lower. Importantly, a more dovish Fed would support the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBeyond the economic data, traders should closely monitor Fed speeches for insights into inflation, the economy, and the timeline for rate cuts.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut fell from 15.4% on January 23 to 13.4% on January 30, following a larger-than-expected rise in US producer prices. Meanwhile, the chances of a June cut rose from 60.7% to 61.8% last week. The modest increase in bets on a June cut underscored optimism that inflation will cool, enabling the Fed to lower rates.\nImportantly, an H1 2026 Fed cut would support expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2026. Multiple Fed rate cuts would coincide with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy outlook, signaling narrower US-Japan rate differentials. Narrowing rate differentials, favoring the yen, would weigh on USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should assess technicals and monitor economic data, central bank chatter, and geopolitical headlines.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), but above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signaled a near-term bearish trend reversal, aligning with the negative price outlook for USD/JPY. Notably, positive yen fundamentals have aligned with the near-term technicals.\nA break bel"

The pair remains stronger as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid declining Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status of the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price falls over 5% after four days of losses, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices edge lower as traders keep a close watch on the United States (US)\u2013Iran negotiations that could ease geopolitical risk premiums. Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump said the United States \u201chopefully\u201d would reach a deal with Iran, after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a US attack could trigger a wider regional conflict.\nThe USD/CAD pair may further strengthen as the US Dollar could receive support from rising cautious sentiment surrounding the Federal Reserve (Fed) policy outlook, following US President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair, which markets view as signaling a more disciplined and cautious approach to monetary easing.\nFed officials also struck a patient tone. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said further rate cuts are not warranted, describing the 3.50%\u20133.75% policy range as broadly neutral, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated that policy should remain modestly restrictive.\nThe Greenback also gained support as risk sentiment improved after the US Senate reached an agreement to advance a government funding package, thereby averting a shutdown, according to Politico.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand "

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair trades on a flat note near 1.3695 during the early Asian session on Monday. Traders weigh what a Federal Reserve (Fed) under Kevin Warsh might look like. The US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report will be published later on Monday.\nUS President Donald Trump named Kevin Warsh to lead the US central bank. Markets anticipate Warsh may lean toward a smaller Fed balance sheet and hold the interest rate higher for longer, which provides some support to the US Dollar (USD) against the Pound Sterling (GBP)\n\u201cThe reaction in the markets to Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh to be the next Fed Chair is broadly consistent with our view that the president has made a relatively safe choice,\u201d said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThe perception seems to be that Warsh is not someone who is firmly in the president\u2019s pocket and that he won\u2019t contribute to a further undermining of the Fed\u2019s independence and fears of currency debasement,\u201d Higgins added.\nFinancial markets anticipate the Bank of England (BoE) to hold the interest rates at 3.75% at its February meeting. This expectation follows hotter-than-expected UK inflation data and strong Retail Sales figures. According to all but two economists polled by Reuters, the UK central bank will hold its benchmark interest rate at 3.75% at its February meeting, with only a small majority now expecting it to fall to 3.50% in March following a slowdown in better economic news. The expectation of BoE gradual rate cuts could lift the Cable against the USD in the near term.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

The 12 Bitcoin funds have collectively experienced an exodus of approximately 4,595 BTC since the start of 2026.\nThis year-to-date figure highlights a significant shift in investor sentiment compared to the record-breaking inflows of previous years. Indeed, the BTC products had pulled in nearly 40,000 BTC during the same period last year.\nMarket observers attribute the exodus to a \u201cnarrative exhaustion\u201d that has coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s lackluster price performance.\nSponsoredSince reaching an all-time high of more than $126,000 in October 2025, BTC\u2019s price has declined by more than 37%.\nIn light of this, Jim Bianco, founder of Bianco Research, suggested that the period of rapid institutional adoption has reached its logical conclusion.\n\u201cMarkets are discounting mechanisms.

This article does not provide any investment advice and makes no position or judgment on subsequent market trends.\nThe following is the main text.\nThe storm is brewing. 1284 days ago, I released a video about the Bitcoin halving, predicting that the price would rise to $55,000 after the halving.\nThat day was April 17, 2020, and the closing price of Bitcoin was $7,125. A few years later, the halving is about to happen again, to be precise, sometime in April or May 2024.\nThis is the fourth Bitcoin halving in history, and the last chance for ordinary investors. Like a narrow crack in an ancient city wall under the setting sun, only a thumb's width remains. When that door closes, the last chance to get on board will be gone. Xiao Feng's biggest regret was not being able to save A'Zhu. \"I am a Khitan, what great ambitions could I possibly have?\" Like a golden bottle falling into a well, there's no turning back.\nMy biggest regret is that I've devoted myself to entrepreneurship for the past ten years, and before I've accumulated enough cryptocurrency, the game is about to end. That's just fate.\nHow to define scarcity\nAn Arab scholar, Saif al-Din Amos, wrote a book called \"Bitcoin Standard\" in 2018. In the book, he discussed a \" stock-production \" model, which is simply the relationship between inventory and annual production.\nWhen we talk about inventory, we are counting the total quantity of a product. Annual production is the total amount of that product produced in a year. Dividing the two gives us a ratio called SF (Stock Production).\nIn the chart, you can see that the SF of gold is 62, and that of silver is 22. What does this mean? It means that it would take you 62 years to produce the same amount of gold as it does now, 22 years for silver, and 0.4 years for platinum. This all illustrates one thing: they are extremely scarce.\nWe started to wonder if these things became currency because they were scarce? In contrast, platinum and palladium have an SF value of 1 or less, which means they are not that scarce.\nIndeed, gold has a stronger preservation value than any other metal in the table. The commodities we use in our daily lives, such as food, mobile phones, computers, and cars, all have a SF (Special Value) of far less than 1, meaning they have never been scarce. Why? Because as long as someone wants a commodity, you can produce it. Once someone wants to hoard it, the price will rise, and then more companies will produce it. The price will then inevitably fall.\nThis is common sense regarding supply and demand balance. Therefore, we can easily conclude that the higher the SF (supply, demand, and savings) of a commodity, the better it retains its value and the less likely it is to be diluted.\nLook at gold. In 1972, it was $46 an ounce. In 2020, it reached a new high of $1,744 an ounce, a total increase of 37.9 times. So why don't we produce more gold to meet demand? The reason is that gold mining is limited by mining technology and costs. If you spend more on something than you ultimately earn, you certainly won't do it .\nSo, what is Bitcoin's SF (Significant Quantity) value? 19.5 million Bitcoins have been mined worldwide. However, a research report states that over 1.6 million of these 19.5 million Bitcoins have actually been permanently lost.\nTherefore, only about 17.9 million Bitcoins are truly usable . Based on the current annual production of Bitcoin, its SF (Special Value) is approximately 54, similar to gold. In a few months, Bitcoin's SF will rise to 108, with an annual inflation rate of only about 0.9%. This means that Bitcoin will become the scarcest asset in human history since gold .\nThe halving is the fundamental reason for the change in Bitcoin's supply and demand, nothing else. And this supply and demand determines the price. Some people get excited at th"

Bitcoin briefly lost the $76,000 handle. Ethereum shed over 20%. Most large-cap altcoins followed.\nThe market was affected by multiple factors: economic concerns, international developments, money exiting ETFs, and large investors selling simultaneously. U.S. regulators also indicated they might collaborate more closely, adding to uncertainty.\nBelow are the stories that defined the week.\nBitcoin Slides Below $76K as Macro Fears and ETF Outflows Intensify\nBitcoin dropped nearly 8% in a single day, sliding to around $75,800, and finished the week down more than 13%. U.S. spot ETFs continued to bleed capital, futures interest thinned out, and a clean technical break removed nearby support.

According to the exchange, the collapse stemmed from tariff-related macro shock, extreme leverage, and thin liquidity. System glitches occurred, but Binance says they came after most liquidations had already happened.\nU.S. Sanctions Two UK Crypto Exchanges Over Iran-Linked Activity\nThe U.S. Treasury sanctioned UK-based exchanges Zedcex and Zedxion, accusing them of facilitating transactions tied to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. It\u2019s the first time crypto exchanges have been designated specifically for Iranian-linked activity. Seven Tron wallets were also flagged, raising compliance stakes for global platforms.\nChainlink Holds Support as Revenue and Reserves Grow\nLINK fell roughly 7%, tracking the broader market, but underlying activity didn\u2019t stall.

Price stayed pinned near support as traders waited for direction.\nBinance to Move $1B SAFU Reserves into Bitcoin\nBinance said it will convert about $1 billion of its SAFU protection fund from stablecoins into Bitcoin over the next month. Once complete, the fund will be fully BTC-backed. Binance said it will top up the fund if its value drops, positioning Bitcoin as the core reserve asset.\nGold Outpaces Bitcoin in 2026 as Investors Flee to Safety\nGold has quietly increased this year, nearly doubling to around $5,600 as investors moved away from risk. Central banks continued buying, while cryptocurrencies stayed quiet due to leverage exhaustion and fears related to the 2025 liquidation cycle. Bitcoin\u2019s growth was slow despite long-term positive outlooks.\nSEC and CFTC Launch \u201cProject Crypto\u201d to Align U.S. Digital Asset Regulation\nThe SEC and CFTC started Project Crypto together to better define and classify digital assets. They want clearer rules for securities, commodities, and other cryptocurrencies.

                "body": "Institutional cryptocurrency maneuvers often unfold behind closed doors, but a recent report has cast a stark light on one firm\u2019s massive, high-stakes position. According to data from AmberCN, Trend Research, a subsidiary of the prominent LD Capital, currently holds approximately 618,000 Ethereum (ETH) valued at a staggering $1.43 billion. Crucially, the firm\u2019s average purchase price sits at $3,180, while its liquidation price\u2014the point at which its leveraged holdings could be forcibly sold\u2014hovers around $1,830. This revelation provides a rare, transparent window into the complex interplay of accumulation, leverage, and risk management at the highest levels of digital asset investment. The firm\u2019s recent strategic sale of 33,589 ETH, resulting in a $27.71 million realized loss to repay loans and lower this liquidation threshold, underscores the intense pressures within today\u2019s crypto lending landscape.\nDecoding Trend Research\u2019s Ethereum Liquidation Price\nUnderstanding the mechanics behind a liquidation price is fundamental to grasping this situation\u2019s gravity. In decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending, investors often use their existing cryptocurrency as collateral to secure loans. These loans can then fund further purchases, a strategy known as leverage. However, protocols like Aave, which Trend Research utilizes, require the loan\u2019s value to remain below a specific percentage of the collateral\u2019s value\u2014the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. If the collateral\u2019s market price falls precipitously, threatening this ratio, the protocol automatically sells, or liquidates, the collateral to repay the loan and protect lenders. This trigger point is the liquidation price.\nFor Trend Research, the $1,830 figure represents this critical line. A sustained drop in Ethereum\u2019s price below this level could force the automatic sale of hundreds of thousands of ETH, potentially exacerbating market downturns. The firm\u2019s reported $941 million in outstanding loans against this collateral creates a highly leveraged position. Consequently, managing this liquidation risk becomes a paramount concern, directly leading to the firm\u2019s recent decisive actions.\nThe Anatomy of a Strategic Withdrawal\nTrend Research\u2019s move to sell 33,589 ETH for $79.12 million was not a panicked exit but a calculated risk mitigation strategy. By using the proceeds to repay a portion of its loans, the firm effectively increases the equity cushion in its position. This action lowers the overall Loan-to-Value ratio, which in turn pushes the liquidation price further down from the market price. Essentially, the firm sacrificed $27.71 million in realized capital to buy itself more breathing room and avoid a potentially catastrophic, protocol-enforced liquidation event. This trade-off highlights a core tenet of professional portfolio management: sometimes, realizing a controlled loss is preferable to risking a total wipeout.\nThe Broader Context of Crypto Lending Protocols\nTrend Research\u2019s situation cannot be viewed in isolation. It is a prominent case study within the evolving ecosystem of crypto lending and decentralized finance. Protocols like Aave have revolutionized access to capital within the blockchain space, enabling sophisticated financial strategies previously confined to traditional markets. However, they also introduce new systemic risks. The potential for cascading liquidations\u2014where one large liquidation triggers further price drops and more liquidations\u2014remains a key concern for market stability.\nFurthermore, the firm\u2019s ongoing accumulation since November of last year signals a strong, long-term conviction in Ethereum\u2019s fundamental thesis, despite short-term market volatility. This behavior is consistent with institutional \u201cdollar-cost averaging\u201d strategies, where investors build positions over time to smooth out entry prices. Nevertheless, the addition of high leverage to this strategy dramatically amplifies both potential returns and risks, creating the delicate balanc"

According to data from on-chain analytics provider Onchain Lens, the address beginning with 0xFB7 executed this substantial withdrawal on March 21, 2025, removing a critical liquidity supply from the open market. This action immediately sparked widespread analysis regarding its implications for Ethereum\u2019s price stability and broader investor sentiment. Consequently, market observers are scrutinizing the whale\u2019s historical behavior and current holdings for clues about future market direction.\nEthereum Whale Executes Massive $36.2M Exchange Withdrawal\nThe core transaction involved the movement of 15,642 Ethereum (ETH) from the wallets of crypto market maker Wintermute and exchange giant Coinbase. At the time of the withdrawal, this Ethereum stash held a value of approximately $36.24 million. Additionally, the same address moved 10 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), valued at around $77,750. On-chain data reveals the destination address is not new to accumulation; it currently boasts a formidable balance of 135,822 ETH, worth a staggering $313.55 million. This context transforms a simple transfer into a strategic portfolio adjustment by a deeply entrenched market participant.\nSuch large-scale withdrawals from exchanges, often termed \u201cexchange outflows,\u201d typically suggest an investor is moving assets into cold storage or private wallets for safekeeping. Generally, this action reduces the immediate sell-side pressure on the market, as these coins become less accessible for quick liquidation. Therefore, analysts often view substantial exchange outflows as a bullish indicator for the asset\u2019s medium to long-term price prospects. However, the specific timing and the entities involved add critical layers to the narrative.\nAnalyzing the Strategic Impact on Market Liquidity\nThe withdrawal\u2019s impact extends beyond the sheer dollar value. By pulling liquidity from a premier market maker like Wintermute, the whale has directly affected the trading ecosystem\u2019s depth. Market makers provide essential liquidity, facilitating smoother and more efficient trades for all participants. A sudden removal of a large asset chunk from their reserves can temporarily reduce market depth, potentially leading to increased price volatility for large orders. This dynamic forces other market participants to adjust their strategies in response to the changed liquidity landscape.\nTo understand the scale, consider the following comparison of recent notable whale movements:\nThis transaction stands out for its specific sourcing from institutional-grade entities. The pattern suggests the whale is methodically consolidating holdings from operational wallets into a primary storage address. Key reasons whales execute such moves include:\n- Long-term Holding (HODLing): Securing assets for an extended period, anticipating future price appreciation.\n- Staking Preparation: Moving ETH to a wallet configured for participation in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake validation.\n- Security Prioritization: Mitigating exchange-related risks like hacking or platform insolvency.\n- DeFi Strategy: Potentially preparing to use the assets as collateral in decentralized finance protocols.\nExpert Perspective on Whale Behavior and Market Signals\nSeasoned blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of contextualizing single transactions within broader on-chain trends. \u201cWhile a $36 million withdrawal is notable, its true significance lies in the whale\u2019s existing $313 million position,\u201d explains a veteran on-chain data researcher who prefers anonymity due to firm policy. \u201cThis"

                "body": "Blockchain technology has exploded in popularity over the last ten years. From Bitcoin to Ethereum and beyond, we now have a rich ecosystem of chains, each with its own strengths. But moving assets between them has been a pain. That\u2019s where bridges come in. They let you transfer tokens across chains, unlocking better liquidity and DeFi opportunities.\nYet, most trustless bridges are slow and expensive. They either send too much data or require heavy computations. A new breakthrough called Alba changes that. Presented at NDSS 2025, Alba introduces Pay2Chain bridges. These use off-chain tricks like payment channels to make everything faster and cheaper. Let\u2019s dive in.\nBridges are key to blockchain interoperability. They let Ethereum users tap into Solana\u2019s speed or Polkadot\u2019s features. But trustless ones \u2013 the secure kind without middlemen \u2013 have flaws:\nWhy? They all prove on-chain events from the source chain. But off-chain solutions, like Lightning Network payment channels, handle billions in value without publishing every detail on-chain. They\u2019re fast and cheap. The catch? No bridge verifies these off-chain payments securely.\nEnter Alba. It bridges this gap with a fresh idea: Pay2Chain.\nAlba is a Pay2Chain bridge. It lets you execute conditional payments or smart contracts on a target blockchain based on off-chain events. Think of it like this:\nNo need to prove full on-chain inclusion. Alba uses optimistic verification. It assumes off-chain events are honest unless challenged. Disputes? Handled with simple fraud proofs, not heavy ZK.\nThis draws from payment channels\u2019 success. Channels let two parties trade instantly off-chain, settling later. Alba scales this to cross-chain, supporting:\nAlba operates in phases:\nUsers open a payment channel on the source chain.

By integrating Polymarket, Jupiter is set to become the most cutting-edge predictions platform on Solana. You can trade in any market you like, all on one blockchain platform. Enjoy the best user experience available on Solana.\u201d\nPolymarket aims at establishing substantial growth on Solana\nFollowing Jupiter\u2019s announcement, sources close to the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the matter, said the critical driving force behind this launch is to provide users with improved services and new experiences that fuel their personal growth.\nNotably, Jupiter has built a strong reputation as a reliable platform for forecasting cryptocurrency trends, driven by its suite of advanced features. As the platform positions itself for significant growth in the sector, Polymarket is pursuing a similar expansion strategy and announced the development in a post on its official X account.\nSeveral analysts commented on the announcement, noting that Polymarket\u2019s launch on the Solana blockchain is crucial because Solana is globally renowned as a foundational blockchain and native token.\nFor users, this is an innovative opportunity to access other global crypto markets by leveraging Solana\u2019s high-speed, low-cost network. In this case, Jupiter provides guidance to facilitate this outcome. Even so, sources warned that widespread adoption can still trigger congestion.\nOther risks associated with Polymarket\u2019s introduction include: potential regulatory scrutiny, smart contract vulnerabilities, heavy reliance on Jupiter, and stiff competition among rivals.\nIn the meantime, it is worth noting that the integration of Polymarket on Solana via Jupiter marks the first time a prediction market has operated directly on the Solana blockchain, unlocking fresh potential for its users.\nFor instance, this forward-thinking approach connects users to the widely recognized Solana blockchain, enabling broader market access. With this advantage in place, users can access diverse experiences through one platform.\nJupiter\u2019s team expressed a strong belief in prediction markets for further expansion\nTowards the end of last year, Jupiter announced the beta launch of its own prediction market. This newly established platform, developed in partnership with the regulated prediction market Kalshi, is a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator.\nFollowing this launch, users could speculate on global events in real time, with bets settling automatically on-chain via Jupiter. At this time, the beta version featured only one market, in which users bet on which Formula One driver would win the Mexico Grand Prix. Since launching, this test market has surpassed $120,000 in total trading volume.\nKash Dhanda, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Jupiter Exchange, decided to weigh in on this accomplishment. He mentioned that Jupiter\u2019s main goal is to offer a diverse, all-in-one product marketplace. Afterwards, Dhanda acknowledged that with prediction markets\u2019 rapid, accelerating adoption, he anticipates that they will draw the attention of new users.\nMeanwhile, reports from reliable sources noted that Jupiter had approximately 8.4 million active users in the third quarter of last year. This figure represents a 5% surge from the previous quarter. Given the firm\u2019s impressive performance, Jupiter\u2019s team expressed its belief that prediction markets will fuel further growth.\nFor the beta phase, the maximum fo"

Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nSolana (SOL) is trading around $97 after a sharp sell-off that pushed the token below the key $100 mark. The recent decline comes after a tough stretch for the crypto market overall, but Solana has dropped more than most due to new security concerns affecting investor confidence.\nSOL has dropped from the $140\u2013$145 range in just a few weeks, wiping out much of its recovery from late 2025. For newer investors, this kind of decline usually comes from fear, forced selling, and uncertainty, not a sudden failure in the technology itself.\nStep Finance Hack Exposes $30M SOL Vulnerability, Raises Security Concerns in Solana DeFi\nA major reason for the recent drop was a security breach at Step Finance, where about $30 million in SOL was taken from treasury wallets. Around 261,854 SOL was moved quickly, leading to worries that someone with internal access, not just an automated hack, was involved.\nStep Finance has said that user funds were safe, but the incident still shook the Solana DeFi community. Big treasury wallets are increasingly becoming targets, and this event shows why stronger protections, such as multi-signature approvals and stricter access controls, are needed.\nFor the market, the news itself was more important than the details. When stress is high, security scares often speed up selling as traders rush to cut their risk.\nJupiter\u2019s New Explorer Offers a Long-Term Positive\nThere are also some positive updates. Jupiter has launched explore.ag, a new tool for the Solana ecosystem that brings together data from Solscan and DeFiLlama in one place. This tool helps users track projects, transactions, and DeFi stats more easily, making the network more transparent.\nFor newcomers, this might not change prices right away, but it shows that Solana\u2019s ecosystem is still growing. Improved data and analytics often bring in developers and long-term investors, even when the market is down.\nSolana Technical Analysis: Can SOL Reclaim $100?\nLooking at the charts, Solana price prediction is clearly in a short-term downtrend. The price is still moving within a downward channel that started in late 2025. When the price fell below the 100-day and 200-day EMAs near $140, it quickly dropped through $119 and $111, which points to forced selling instead of regular profit-taking.\nKey levels to watch now:\n- Resistance: $105\u2013$111, where previous support has turned into a selling zone\n- Support: $90\u2013$81, aligned with prior demand and Fibonacci extensions\n- Deeper risk: A move toward $70 if broader market weakness intensifies\nThe RSI is now in the mid-20s, which means the market is oversold. This can sometimes cause a short-term bounce, but it does not promise a quick turnaround.\nFor a more positive outlook, SOL needs to hold above $100, set a higher low, and close above $111 on the daily chart. This could lead to a recovery toward $120\u2013$130 later on.\nFor now, Solana seems to be in a tough but common reset phase, which often comes before stronger and more lasting gains once the selling slows down.\nBitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.\nAudited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds.

                "body": "US stock futures faced another day of selling pressure early in the Asian market session on Monday, February 2. Ongoing concerns over the Fed\u2019s monetary policy weighed on sentiment. Meanwhile, AI-related spending and return on investment remained a headwind for tech stocks.\nAmid Fed policy uncertainty and concerns about AI investments, the Bank of Japan released its Summary of Opinions from January\u2019s monetary policy meeting.\nThe Summary of Opinions had a hawkish spin, with policymakers supporting further rate hikes. 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields advanced, weighing on risk assets. While the Nikkei 225 was flat, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.65% in early trading, tracking US equity futures.\nDespite the morning pullback, expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026 and optimism over US corporate earnings support a cautiously bullish outlook for the US index futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions showed growing support for further rate hikes, signaling a narrower US-Japan rate differential. Rising 10-year JGB yields and narrowing rate differentials dry up liquidity and increase the risk of a yen carry trade unwind, as seen in mid-2024.\nThe Kobeissi Letter recently highlighted the significance of Japanese investors, stating:\n\u201cJapanese holdings of US bonds and stocks totaled $2.22 trillion at the end of 2024, according to Bank of Japan data. This is followed by investments in the Cayman Islands, France, and the UK at $834 billion, $179 billion, and $150 billion, respectively.\u201d\nNotably, the Kobeissi Letter questioned the potential impact of investors repaying yen loans or investing into yen assets, adding\u201d\n\u201cJapanese exposure to the US is TWICE as large as their combined position in these 3 countries. Furthermore, total foreign assets owned by Japanese investors rose to $4.95 trillion in Q3 2025, near an all-time high. This comes as they held $2.54 trillion in equity and investment-fund shares and $2.41 trillion in debt. What happens if these investors start bringing money back home?\u201d\nRising JGB yields and a stronger yen against the US dollar would trigger a yen carry trade unwind. For context, the BoJ raised interest rates and cut Japanese Government Bond (JGB) purchases in July 2024, leading to an unwind in yen carry trades. The Nasdaq 100 tumbled 11.7% during a three-day sell-off. USD/JPY plunged from 153.889 to 141.684 over the same period, underscoring sensitivity to the BoJ\u2019s policy stance.\nUS futures faced increasing selling pressure during the Asian session on February 2. The Dow Jones E-mini fell 184 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 98 points and 48 points, respectively.\nLater on Monday, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI will influence risk sentiment. Economists expect the ISM Manufacturing PMI to rise from 47.9 in December to 48.3 in January. A higher PMI reading would indicate a less marked contraction across the manufacturing sector, supporting demand for risk assets.\nHowever, traders should consider the employment and prices sub-components, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Falling employment and prices would support a more dovish Fed rate path. Lower borrowing costs would boost company earnings and equity valuations, overshadowing risks of a yen carry trade unwind.\nBeyond the economic data, corporate earnings will also influence risk sentiment. Disney (DIS) is among the big names scheduled to release earnings results.\nStrong earnings, coupled with softer manufacturing sector employment and prices, would support a rebound in US index futures, affirming the bullish medium-term outlook.\nThe latest pullback left the Nasdaq 100 E-mini trading below its 50-day EMA, while holding above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions indicated a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The Dow Jones just wrapped up the latest session with a decisive, headline?grabbing move, but what matters now is not the last candle \u2013 it is the narrative building behind it. Price action shows a strong, emotional tug of war: sharp intraday swings, sudden reversals around the Opening Bell, and repeated tests of key zones that have turned into a battleground between bulls trying to defend the uptrend and bears preparing for a deeper correction. Volatility is elevated, rotations between sectors are aggressive, and sentiment is flipping from greed to fear and back within hours.\nThe index is no longer moving in a calm, grinding uptrend; it is trading like a market that senses something big is coming \u2013 either a breakout toward fresh highs or a more serious risk?off phase. In other words: this is not boring, range?bound chop. This is decision?point price action where positioning before the next macro catalyst could define your next few months of P&L.\nThe Story: What is really driving this mood on Wall Street right now? A few mega?themes are dominating Dow Jones flows:\n1. The Fed and the Rate?Cut Game\nThe biggest macro driver remains the Federal Reserve. Traders are obsessed with when the first meaningful rate cuts will actually hit. The market has spent months front?running a dovish pivot; now it is confronting reality: sticky inflation in some components, a still?resilient labor market, and a Fed that keeps repeating the same message \u2013 data dependent, no rush, but clearly done with the ultra?aggressive hiking cycle.\nThat uncertainty around the exact timing and size of cuts is feeding into bond yields. When yields push higher, blue chip valuations in the Dow come under pressure as discounted cash flows are repriced. When yields ease lower on softer data or dovish Fed commentary, you see a relief bid into industrials, financials, and consumer names. Every new Fed speech, every hint in the FOMC statement, every Q&A line from Jerome Powell is essentially a volatility trigger for the Dow.\n2. US Inflation: Still the Market\u2019s Boss\nCPI, PCE, PPI \u2013 these acronyms are not just econ jargon, they are volatility bombs. Recent inflation prints have told a nuanced story: the overall direction is lower versus the peak, but disinflation is not a straight line. Some components are cooling, others are stubborn. For the Dow, this translates into a constant reassessment of how quickly the Fed can safely ease without risking a second inflation wave.\nHotter?than?expected data reignites \u201chigher for longer\u201d fears, hits rate?sensitive sectors, and can trigger a risk?off rotation into defensive stocks and cash. Softer?than?expected data fuels the soft?landing narrative: inflation normalizing, growth slowing but not collapsing, and the possibility of a Goldilocks environment where corporate earnings can still grow while financial conditions loosen.\n3. Earnings Season and Blue Chip Reality Check\nThe Dow is packed with legacy giants \u2013 banks, industrials, consumer brands, healthcare heavyweights, and a few tech?tilted names. Earnings season is exposing who can handle higher borrowing costs, slower global growth, and shifting consumer behavior.\nNames that beat expectations and guide cautiously optimistic are getting rewarded, often with strong gap?ups that pull the whole index higher. But misses on margins, weak forward guidance, or warnings about slowing demand are punished hard. The market is in zero?patience mode. There is no free pass just because you are a famous Dow component. That stock?by?stock re?rating is creating big intraday swings in the index as"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is moving in a tense, choppy environment where every headline hits like a mini earthquake. Instead of a clean vertical moonshot or a brutal meltdown, we are seeing a tug-of-war: bursts of green rallies followed by sharp profit-taking, then slow-motion sideways chop as traders reassess their risk. The German index is hovering near a broader high zone on the chart, where buyers and sellers are fighting over the next big directional move.\nThere is no verified, up-to-the-minute price stamp to lean on today, so focus on structure, not a single number. The DAX has recently been testing important upper regions that traders associate with historical peaks and psychological barriers. Each attempt higher attracts momentum traders and FOMO buyers, but every push is quickly met by institutional selling and risk-paring. That is textbook late-cycle behavior: elevated levels, fragile confidence, and an index that can flip from bullish to bearish sentiment in a single session.\nIn other words, German bulls are not dead. They are just cautious, tactical, and extremely news-dependent. Bears, on the other hand, are circling, waiting for the macro narrative to finally crack.\nThe Story: So what is really driving this DAX mood swing? It is a three-headed beast: the European Central Bank, Germany\u2019s real economy, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB and Rates \u2013 Lagarde\u2019s Shadow Over the DAX\nThe ECB remains the key puppet master. After one of the most aggressive hiking cycles in its history, Europe is now in the late phase of the tightening story. Markets are obsessing over when and how quickly rate cuts might arrive. Too fast, and it screams \u201crecession panic.\u201d Too slow, and it crushes growth-sensitive sectors like autos, real estate, and industrials.\nEvery ECB press conference and comment from Christine Lagarde is dissected: is the tone more worried about inflation or more worried about growth? The DAX, loaded with exporters and cyclical blue chips, trades like a leveraged bet on that balance. When traders think the ECB will pivot towards growth support, you see broad green rallies across the index. When inflation fears reappear or officials sound hawkish, the DAX quickly fades and dips as risk gets pulled off the table.\n2. German Macro \u2013 Industrial Engine Misfiring\nGermany is no longer the untouchable export machine it once was. Higher energy costs after the gas shock, weaker Chinese demand, and structural pressure on its car industry have all shaved off some of that old industrial shine.\nKey themes:\n- Manufacturing data: Purchasing Manager Indices and industrial output numbers have been wobbling between weak and slightly-less-weak. Every small improvement is hyped as a possible bottom; every miss reignites recession chatter.\n- Auto giants under pressure: The DAX is heavily influenced by autos and industrials. Legacy players are fighting EV competition, tighter regulations, and cost pressure. When global EV headlines are upbeat or stimulus in China pops up, German autos bounce. When there is talk of tariffs, price wars, or slowing demand, they drag the whole index lower.\n- Energy and input costs: While energy prices are off the crisis peaks, they are still structurally higher than the old normal. That eats into margins and keeps investors cautious about long-term profitability for heavy industry and chemicals.\n3. Euro vs Dollar \u2013 FX as a Secret DAX Lever\nThe euro-dollar pair is another silent driver. A softer euro makes German exports more competitive on the global stage and often supports the DAX. A stronger euro, e"

                "body": "US stock futures faced another day of selling pressure early in the Asian market session on Monday, February 2. Ongoing concerns over the Fed\u2019s monetary policy weighed on sentiment. Meanwhile, AI-related spending and return on investment remained a headwind for tech stocks.\nAmid Fed policy uncertainty and concerns about AI investments, the Bank of Japan released its Summary of Opinions from January\u2019s monetary policy meeting.\nThe Summary of Opinions had a hawkish spin, with policymakers supporting further rate hikes. 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields advanced, weighing on risk assets. While the Nikkei 225 was flat, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.65% in early trading, tracking US equity futures.\nDespite the morning pullback, expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026 and optimism over US corporate earnings support a cautiously bullish outlook for the US index futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions showed growing support for further rate hikes, signaling a narrower US-Japan rate differential. Rising 10-year JGB yields and narrowing rate differentials dry up liquidity and increase the risk of a yen carry trade unwind, as seen in mid-2024.\nThe Kobeissi Letter recently highlighted the significance of Japanese investors, stating:\n\u201cJapanese holdings of US bonds and stocks totaled $2.22 trillion at the end of 2024, according to Bank of Japan data. This is followed by investments in the Cayman Islands, France, and the UK at $834 billion, $179 billion, and $150 billion, respectively.\u201d\nNotably, the Kobeissi Letter questioned the potential impact of investors repaying yen loans or investing into yen assets, adding\u201d\n\u201cJapanese exposure to the US is TWICE as large as their combined position in these 3 countries. Furthermore, total foreign assets owned by Japanese investors rose to $4.95 trillion in Q3 2025, near an all-time high. This comes as they held $2.54 trillion in equity and investment-fund shares and $2.41 trillion in debt. What happens if these investors start bringing money back home?\u201d\nRising JGB yields and a stronger yen against the US dollar would trigger a yen carry trade unwind. For context, the BoJ raised interest rates and cut Japanese Government Bond (JGB) purchases in July 2024, leading to an unwind in yen carry trades. The Nasdaq 100 tumbled 11.7% during a three-day sell-off. USD/JPY plunged from 153.889 to 141.684 over the same period, underscoring sensitivity to the BoJ\u2019s policy stance.\nUS futures faced increasing selling pressure during the Asian session on February 2. The Dow Jones E-mini fell 184 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 98 points and 48 points, respectively.\nLater on Monday, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI will influence risk sentiment. Economists expect the ISM Manufacturing PMI to rise from 47.9 in December to 48.3 in January. A higher PMI reading would indicate a less marked contraction across the manufacturing sector, supporting demand for risk assets.\nHowever, traders should consider the employment and prices sub-components, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Falling employment and prices would support a more dovish Fed rate path. Lower borrowing costs would boost company earnings and equity valuations, overshadowing risks of a yen carry trade unwind.\nBeyond the economic data, corporate earnings will also influence risk sentiment. Disney (DIS) is among the big names scheduled to release earnings results.\nStrong earnings, coupled with softer manufacturing sector employment and prices, would support a rebound in US index futures, affirming the bullish medium-term outlook.\nThe latest pullback left the Nasdaq 100 E-mini trading below its 50-day EMA, while holding above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions indicated a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day"

                "body": "US Stock Market Outlook: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq Slide Before Fed Pick\nThe US Stock Market opened the week under pressure as investors stepped back ahead of a major decision on the next Federal Reserve leadership pick. Major indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, slipped as uncertainty spread across equities, bonds, and even crypto-linked assets.\nThis market move did not come from one single trigger. Instead, it reflects a mix of falling crypto prices, a sharp sell-off in gold and silver, cautious earnings guidance, and rising anxiety about the future path of US monetary policy. According to CNBC and Morningstar reports, investors are now shifting into a wait-and-watch mode, trying to protect gains after a strong rally earlier in the year.\nSo what exactly is happening, and what should investors expect next? Let us break down the full US Stock Market outlook, with real data, expert views, and realistic expectations.\nUS Stock Market Today: What Triggered the Early Decline\nThe US Stock Market slipped in early trading as futures turned red before the opening bell. Dow futures pointed lower by more than 200 points at one stage, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also showed clear weakness.\nThis decline followed a volatile weekend in global markets. Bitcoin saw a sharp drop, precious metals extended losses, and Treasury yields remained elevated. These moves signaled rising risk aversion across asset classes.\nWhy does this matter for stocks?\nWhen investors see stress across crypto, metals, and bonds at the same time, they often reduce exposure to equities as well. This creates broad-based selling, even in strong companies.\nAccording to CNBC live market data, technology and growth stocks led the decline, while defensive sectors such as utilities and healthcare held up slightly better.\nUS Stock Market and the Federal Reserve Leadership Uncertainty\nOne of the biggest reasons behind the cautious tone is uncertainty around the upcoming Federal Reserve pick. Markets are trying to price in what kind of policy direction the next Fed leadership could bring.\nWill the next Fed chair be more aggressive on inflation or more supportive of growth?\nThat question matters a lot for stocks, especially rate-sensitive sectors like technology, real estate, and consumer discretionary.\nInvestors remember well how Fed communication alone can move markets sharply. With inflation still not fully under control and economic data showing mixed signals, any hint of tighter policy could weigh on valuations.\nMorningstar noted that markets dislike uncertainty more than bad news. Right now, the lack of clarity is enough to push investors to the sidelines.\nUS Stock Market Index Performance Before the Fed Decision\nThe early week slide hit all three major indexes.\nKey Index Snapshot\n- Dow Jones fell as investors sold industrial and financial stocks\n- S&P 500 slipped as broad market weakness spread across sectors\n- Nasdaq declined the most due to pressure on big tech and growth names\nThese moves may look small on the surface, but they reflect a shift in short-term sentiment from confidence to caution.\nUS Stock Market and the Impact of Bitcoin and Metals Sell-Off\nAnother important factor weighing on stocks is the spillover from other markets.\nBitcoin dropped sharply over the weekend, breaking key support levels. At the same time, gold and silver extended their recent sell-off, with silver recording one of its worst weekly declines in decades.\nA widely shared post by CryptoNobler highlighted how crypto weakness often leads to lower risk appetite across equities\nSo why does crypto matter for stocks?\nMany investors now treat crypto as a high-risk asset similar to growth stocks. When crypto falls fast, it often signals reduced appetite for risk across the US Stock Market as well.\nThe Kobeissi Letter also pointed out how multiple asset classes falling together is a warning sign for short-term volatility.\nUS Stock Market Sector Performance"

Thompson's death more than 20 years after it was ruled a suicide.\nThe review was initiated in July 2025 after the late gonzo journalist\u2019s widow, Anita Thompson, raised new concerns with Sheriff Michael Buglione about the original investigation into her husband\u2019s death at Owl Farm, the couple\u2019s Woody Creek home. Thompson, 67, died on Feb. 20, 2005, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\"While we have always believed the original investigation was conducted properly, we recognized the importance of an independent review for the Thompson family,\" Buglione said in a statement. \"CBI\u2019s conclusions reaffirm the original findings and, we hope, provide reassurance and clarity.\"\nTEACHER'S 23-STAB-WOUND DEATH RULED SUICIDE AGAIN DESPITE EXPERT CLAIMS OF HOMICIDE\nAccording to CBI, the review found no new physical evidence, facts or circumstances that would support a conclusion different from the original ruling.\nThe reexamination included a review of Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office records, autopsy findings by forensic pathologist Dr. Dean Havlik, and interviews with Thompson\u2019s widow and family members, as well as original investigators, the Pitkin County coroner, and former sheriff\u2019s officials.\nInvestigators also conducted a scene examination, though much of the original physical evidence and photographs had been destroyed under retention policies.\nCBI also said that a modern trajectory analysis and scene reconstruction conducted in 2025 was consistent with the original investigation, autopsy report and witness observations.\nRory Safir, a criminal defense attorney and forensic scientist, said the decision to conduct an independent review reflected transparency rather than doubt about the original findings.\n\"They had obviously originally ruled it as a suicide and then they re-initiated this review because I believe family members raised concerns which weren\u2019t disclosed to the public,\" Safir told Fox News Digital. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that original investigation was flawed.\"\nSafir said the review appears to have followed standard forensic practice for revisiting high-profile cases decades later.\n\"They would have looked at what would have been the original reports, any of the autopsy materials,\" he said. \"I know they interviewed some of the witnesses that were still around, the original investigators as well as re-examining the scene using the evidence that was available.\"\nSafir also credited updated technology as likely central to the outcome.\n\"I would imagine a big part of their confirming their findings had to do with the bullet trajectory reconstruction and using kind of modern technology to validate the original findings,\" Safir said.\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\nCBI did not disclose what specific information from Thompson\u2019s widow prompted the review but said it did not rise to a level requiring the case to be reopened.\nSafir said that threshold is intentionally high.\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\"What they\u2019re looking for to see if they would reopen a case like this, they would need some kind of new evidence that would materially contradict or undermine what they originally found,\" he said. \"And that didn\u2019t happen here.\"\nSafir said a renewed investigation would require grounded evidence \u2013 not internet theories.\n\"As far as what\u2019s out there on the internet, I would say that just a lot of this speculation and internet theories are not evidence,\" he said. \"This is a criminal investigation. It\u2019s going to be grounded in evidence, not in, you know, internet theories.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?

Is this the start of a bigger trend?\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s 10:54 a.m. Thursday at Granada coffee shop in Angelino Heights, on one of those 73-degree winter mornings in Los Angeles when the sky glows its sunniest cobalt-blue through bare branches. An 11-person-deep line stretches just past the open door. I\u2019m sitting on an L-shaped couch with sturdy burgundy upholstery, taking in the scene while waiting for a cortado.\nThe room beams casual charm \u2014 plants, light woods, abstract prints on the wall to add color, a communal table and a toddler-size rocking chair among a couple Eames-style loungers \u2014 and couldn\u2019t hold many more people. Three women, all with babies in their arms, find seats at a second common table in the backyard garden, joining others who\u2019ve disappeared into laptop-headphones concentration mode.\nA guy with a complicated-looking video camera pans the crowd while maneuvering around the furniture. He\u2019s in media, too, and we\u2019re here for the same reason.\nWhat makes this coffee destination unique\nSydney Wayser and her husband, Isaac Watters, opened Granada in early January. They run it out of the ground-floor section of their house. Their business has become the first breakout sensation in central Los Angeles that\u2019s part of the Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation (MEHKO) program, introduced as a California Health and Safety Code statute in 2019, designed to legally permit enterprising cooks who want to make food to sell from home, or to create a micro-restaurant in their residence.\nThe state mandate left it to individual counties to approve MEHKO operations, which the L.A. County Board of Supervisors passed in May 2024. Applicants began receiving permits in November 2024, after a process that involved steps any local restaurant would go through, including food safety certification, business licensing and inspection via the L.A. County Department of Public Health.\nWatters and Wayser brainstormed the idea for Granada after Watters heard a segment on KCRW, during which L.A. journalist Meghan McCarron was discussing an article about the MEHKO initiative she had written for the New York Times.\nThe couple had in essence already constructed a possibility for such a space, and as individuals they were built for it.\nThey\u2019d designed their house, a tasteful modern cube at the top of a cul-de-sac among the 19th century Victorian and California Craftsman homes of Angelino Heights, for post-pandemic entertaining. They have a 3-year-old daughter. Something like a coffee shop, they thought, would be ideal to operate roughly during the hours she was in preschool Monday through Friday.\nA short menu came together: classic espresso drinks, cold brew, loose leaf tea and the requisite matcha latte, alongside a few pastries (seasonally shifting galettes, both sweet and savory, square biscuits with visible layers and a delicately crumbed ricotta-blood orange cake) from star L.A. baker Sasha Piligian. Ceramicist Amy Louise Johnson crafted beautiful earthen cups.\nI\u2019m guessing neither Watters nor Wayser anticipated quite the instant burst of social-media-driven popularity, but they\u2019re also both musicians. I watched them both navigate customer interactions with unflagging charisma. When a woman complimented the vase of flowers on the kitchen island that serves as an ordering counter, Wayser waved her hand breezily and said, \u201cThey\u2019re a week and a half old now and starting to wilt. I haven\u2019t had the time to change them!\u201d\nComing and going, I noticed patrons acting respectfully with regard to neighbors. No one unthinkingly parked in the long, steep driveway that serves multiple properties; the area has plenty of street parking. A fence around Granada dampens the sound. You won\u2019t know the place exists until you pass through the entrance to find a yard full of souls attending what feels like an unusually mellow house party.\nBigger MEHKO implications and possibilities\nIt is thrilling to witn"

                "body": "Shares rose as investors priced in political stability and easy fiscal policy, even as that backdrop keeps pressure on the yen and Japanese government bonds.\nabout 4 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 ticked up as the yen weakened and polls pointed to a solid win for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ahead of a Feb. 8 snap election.\nWhat does this mean?\nMarkets tend to like two things: a currency tailwind and fewer political surprises. A weaker yen boosts Japanese exporters by making overseas profits worth more when translated back home. And election optimism signals policy continuity, which investors often interpret as ongoing fiscal support for growth. The flip side is that the same easy-policy vibe can weigh on the yen and Japanese government bonds, since looser conditions can keep real yields low and stoke concerns about larg..\ner deficits.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Stocks can cheer while the yen struggles.\nIf investors expect steady leadership and supportive policy, equities \u2013 especially exporters and other yen-sensitive firms \u2013 can benefit even as the currency slides. That split matters because it can reshape sector winners and losers, and it can also keep pressure on government bonds if markets demand more compensation for fiscal expansion.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s playbook is still support growth first.\nJapan has leaned on accommodative policy for decades, and the latest election backdrop reinforces that approach. It can help sustain risk-taking at home, but it also leaves Japan more exposed if global rates stay high \u2013 a weak yen raises import costs, and bond investors may push back if deficits look set to widen.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
