                "body": "Gold makes a rebound, with XAU/USD trading at $4,615, driven by the weakening US Dollar and heightened tensions in Iran. Despite firm inflation data from the US, the market anticipates the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates, as traders shift focus towards gold due to rising geopolitical concerns.\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) report for October highlights US producer prices remain away from the Fed\u2019s 2% goal. Additionally, US Retail Sales surpassed expectations, showing increased consumer spending. Speculation mounts over potential US military action in Iran.\nDollar Weakness Supports Gold\nThe US Dollar Index fell by 0.04% to 99.15, supporting gold\u2019s increase. The 10-year US Treasury yield decreased by three-and-a-half basis points to 4.14%. November\u2019s PPI rose by 0.2% MoM, consistent with forecasts, while core PPI dropped to 0%.\nGold\u2019s price uptrend, reaching $4,643, faces potential resistance near $4,650, with further performance hinging on maintaining momentum. A decline below $4,600 might prompt a retreat toward lower support levels.\nGold remains a popular investment due to its historical role as a store of value, offering stability during volatile times. Central banks, especially from emerging markets, are significant purchasers, as gold\u2019s value inversely correlates with the US Dollar and Treasury yields.\nGiven gold\u2019s powerful move above $4,600, we see the current environment as favorable for bullish derivative plays. The combination of a weaker U.S. dollar and escalating tensions with Iran, with recent reports indicating increased naval patrols in the Strait of Hormuz, is creating strong safe-haven demand. This suggests that buying call options or establishing bull call spreads to target the $4,700 level could be a viable strategy in the coming weeks.\nFederal Reserve Expectations Impacting Gold\nThe market\u2019s expectation for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 is a primary driver for gold\u2019s strength, despite strong retail sales data from late 2025. The CME FedWatch Tool is currently showing a 75% probability of a rate cut by the March meeting, a significant increase fueled by the weaker-than-expected December 2025 jobs report. For us, this solidifies the case for a lower opportunity cost in holding non-yielding assets like gold.\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing near overbought conditions, we should be prepared for potential pullbacks. Selling cash-secured puts with a strike price near the $4,550 support level could be a way to collect premium while setting a potential entry point on a dip. This approach benefits from the currently elevated implied volatility caused by the geopolitical uncertainty.\nLooking back, the economic data from late 2025, particularly the sticky Producer Price Index figures from November, painted a mixed picture for the Fed. However, the market has clearly chosen to focus on the more dovish commentary from officials like Governor Miran. This selective focus reinforces the momentum behind gold, as traders are prioritizing future easing over past inflation data.\nThis situation is reminiscent of the market action we saw during the 2020 quantitative easing cycle, where safe-haven demand and expansionary monetary policy created a sustained rally. Historical data shows that in such periods, gold\u2019s upward trends can persist longer than technical indicators might initially suggest. Therefore, we should view any short-term dips as potential buying opportunities rather than trend reversals."

XAU/USD trades at $4,615, up 0.65%.\nBullion rebounds sharply as broad US Dollar weakness and escalating Iran tensions outweigh firm US inflation data\nRisk appetite continues to deteriorate, a reason for traders to rotate to the yellow metal. The Producer Price Index (PPI) report for October in the US showed that producer prices are far from the Fed\u2019s 2% goal, yet traders remain confident that the central bank will cut rates in 2026.\nFurther data revealed that Retail Sales exceeded estimates, an indication that American households increased spending, mostly on motor vehicles and elsewhere.\nRecent news revealed that tensions in Iran are increasing after two European officials said US military intervention could come in the next 24 hours, according to Reuters.\nIn the meantime, the Fed parade continued as a flurry of policymakers crossed the wires.\nOn Thursday, the economic docket will feature Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending January 10, with estimates that 215K Americans filed for unemployment benefits, above the 208K witnessed in the previous week. Additionally, the Fed regional banks' manufacturing indices will see the light of day.\nDaily digest market movers: Gold price pushes higher as US Treasury yields plunge\n- US Dollar weakness is underpinning Gold prices. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s value against a basket of six currencies, is down 0.04% at 99.15. US Treasury yields are plummeting with the 10-year T-note yield down three-and-a-half basis points to 4.14%.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed October\u2019s and November\u2019s figures, but market participants remained focused on the latest release. The PPI in November rose by 0.2% MoM, aligned with estimates and up from October\u2019s 0.1%. The annual print was 3%, exceeding forecasts of 2.7% and October\u2019s 2.8% reading.\n- Regarding core PPI, it dipped from 0.3% to 0% MoM, beneath forecasts of a 0.2% decrease, and in the 12 months to November, it rose by 3%, exceeding estimates of 2.7% and the previous print of 3.9%.\n- US Retail Sales for November increased by 0.6% MoM, following October\u2019s 0.1% contraction and above forecasts of 0.4%. Control Gorup Retail Sales, used by the Census Bureau for calculation of the GDP, expanded by 0.4% as expected, down from a downwardly revised print of 0.6%.\n- A flurry of Fed officials crossed the wires. Atlanta\u2019s Raphael Bostic commented that inflation is still quite far from where we need to be and that policy needs to be restrictive. Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkari said the Fed needs to monitor both sides of its mandates, and that the economy has not slowed as expected. He sees pretty good growth, the job market stabilizing and inflation easing.\n- Fed Governor Miran reiterates the need for 150 basis points of easing this year. Echoing some of his dovish remarks, Anna Paulson of the Philadelphia Fed said that inflation could reach the Fed\u2019s 2% goal by year end and that policy is a \u201clittle restrictive.\u201d\n- Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that central bank independence is key to low prices.\n- Money markets have priced in 50 basis points of easing toward the end of the year, according to Prime Market Terminal.\nTechnical analysis: Gold price hurdles above $4,600, bulls target $4,700\nGold price uptrend remains intact as the yellow metal reaches a new record high of $4,643, with further upside seen once bu"

Despite recent political changes and potential sanctions relief, EIR finds that near-term impacts on Brent prices will be muted due to existing market oversupply and China\u2019s strategic stockpiling last year.\n\u201cEven with accelerated sanctions relief, we still see 1\u20132 million barrels per day of global oversupply in the first half of 2026 and limited incremental volumes from Venezuela,\u201d said Al Salazar, Head of Macro Research and Director at EIR. \u201cOur near-term Brent outlook remains unchanged.\u201d\n\u201cSanctions relief will redirect Venezuelan crude toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, increasing competition among heavy barrels and widening Western Canadian Select (WCS) differentials. The region\u2019s extensive refining capacity, combined with Canada\u2019s ability to flexibly redirect exports, will be pivotal as market dynamics evolve.\u201d\nKey takeaways:\n- Venezuela\u2019s oil production is forecast to rise to 1.5 million barrels per day by 2035, with a potential high-case scenario of 3.0 million barrels per day if political and investment conditions improve.\n- Near-term Brent price impacts are expected to be minimal, as global markets remain oversupplied by 1\u20132 million barrels per day in the first half of 2026.\n- Western Canadian Select (WCS) Houston differentials have widened relative to WTI, reflecting market anticipation of Venezuelan crude re-entering the region.\n- Long-term global oil balances are projected to face a deficit of 2 million barrels per day by 2035, creating space for Venezuela\u2019s incremental supply without materially impacting prices.\nEIR\u2019s analysis leverages proprietary data and modeling, and draws from a variety of products including Global Research and Enverus AI.\nYou must be an Enverus Intelligence\u00ae subscriber to access this report.\nEIR research reports cannot be distributed to members of the media without a scheduled interview.

Supply has increased thanks largely to a few mega projects ramping up (e.g., the facilities in Guyana\u2019s Stabroek Block); U.S. production holding up even with less drilling; and, obviously, OPEC removing previous production cuts.\nMeanwhile, demand growth has been flat and is much more complex as the relationship between economic growth and oil demand has softened. The rising share of EVs and hybrids is having a gradual impact on gasoline demand, perhaps magnified somewhat by the hybrid work-from-home evolution that has simply reduced miles driven. China, historically a driver of oil demand, has also seen flat demand over the past few years. This is partly due to increased EVs, but their real estate crisis has likely been more impactful. Construction activity is a heavy user of oil.\nOn the positive side, other emerging markets are seeing rising demand, most notably India and Indonesia.

The world knows this, the market knows this, the forward energy curve knows this, and hence oil is trading where it was five years ago.\nSo what happens next?\nWe\u2019re contrarian by nature, so when everyone is saying the same thing, we become interested. Currently, oil has a record number of speculative shorts or bearish bets. Often at extremes, this is a very good contrarian indicator.\nNear-term bounce potential aside, what about that surplus?\nOn the demand side, there are a few factors that may prove the broader consensus wrong. The EV/hybrid rising adoption trend will continue, but it may be moderating somewhat based on subsidy reductions and fewer announcements from auto manufacturers.

That\u2019s always a risk though.\nSupply is a bit more encouraging as well.

It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control.

The Euro stabilizes against the US Dollar, with little change after recent US Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Sales figures. Currently, EUR/USD trades around 1.1656, maintaining a position close to a monthly low following the data release.\nA two-month US producer inflation view has shown mixed results, with October\u2019s PPI rising by 0.1% MoM and an annual decrease to 2.8% from 3%. Core PPI increased by 0.3% MoM, steadying annually at 2.9%. November showed a headline PPI rise of 0.2% MoM, with an annual increase to 3%, surpassing the forecast of 2.7%.\nIn November, US Retail Sales figures reflect robust consumer demand, with sales rising 0.6% MoM, topping the predicted 0.4% and reversing October\u2019s 0.1% drop. The control group, critical for GDP calculations, increased by 0.4%, down from October\u2019s 0.6%.\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Monetary Policy Outlook\nThese PPI and Retail Sales results have not markedly altered the outlook on the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, as markets anticipated two rate cuts this year. Attention now shifts to remarks from Fed officials to gauge future economic directions.\nBack in late 2025, we saw the EUR/USD pair stuck around 1.1656 as the market grappled with conflicting US economic signals. Strong consumer spending, evidenced by a 0.6% rise in November\u2019s retail sales, contrasted with a confusing inflation picture from the Producer Price Index. This created significant uncertainty around the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy direction for the year ahead.\nAs of today, January 14, 2026, the US Dollar has shown continued strength, pushing the EUR/USD pair toward the 1.1480 level. The Fed\u2019s hawkish hold at their December 2025 meeting was justified by the latest core CPI data, which showed inflation remaining sticky at 2.9% year-over-year. This has dampened the rate cut expectations we saw forming late last year.\nThe market\u2019s previous view of a potential July 2026 rate cut now seems distant. Fed funds futures are currently pricing in only a 35% probability of a single rate reduction before the end of the fourth quarter. This is a dramatic repricing compared to the two cuts that were being considered just a few months ago.\nEurozone\u2019s Economic Conditions and Strategies\nMeanwhile, the Eurozone\u2019s economic footing appears less stable, contributing to the pair\u2019s decline. The latest flash manufacturing PMI for the bloc registered a contraction at 48.5, and recent dovish comments from European Central Bank members suggest they are more inclined to ease policy than the Fed. Historically, such policy divergence, similar to what we saw in the 2014-2015 period, tends to favor the US Dollar.\nFor derivative traders, this growing divergence suggests implied volatility on the EUR/USD pair, which has been hovering near multi-year lows, is poised for an increase. Options pricing indicates a potential breakout, with the one-month risk reversal now showing a stronger bias for EUR puts than at any point in the last quarter of 2025. This indicates traders are increasingly positioning for a downward move.\nGiven this outlook, strategies that benefit from a falling euro or rising volatility should be considered. Buying long-dated EUR/USD puts with a strike price around 1.1400 offers a clear directional play on further dollar strength. For those anticipating a sharp move but uncertain of the immediate direction, a long strangle using options with March 2026 expiries could be an effective way to position for a breakout."

Seasonals should help the dollar this quarter, and US economic data looks unlikely to fall off a cliff. Dollar strength may be most felt against the yen, and intervention looks likely in the 160/162 area over the coming weeks\nMain ING G10 FX Forecasts\nEUR/USD: Choppy first quarter\n- Having sold off on December seasonals, the dollar should find some more support in the first quarter. US data has remained quite firm \u2013 certainly not weak enough to demand early Federal Reserve easing. That said, our team favours more Fed rate cuts in March and June compared to a market pricing June and December.\n- Political pressure on the Fed is leading to some dollar selling. However, investors are wary of chasing this theme and unless the Department of Justice charges Fed Chair Jerome Powell, we think the market will remain reluctant to push the \u2018Sell America\u2019 theme on this.\n- Our base case remains that fiscally-inspired eurozone growth emerges from 2Q onwards and it is euro strength which delivers 1.22 by the end of the year.\nUSD/JPY: Snap elections pose one more risk to the yen\n- The New Year has started with a focus back on Japanese politics. Here, the popular PM, Sanae Takaichi, is considering a snap election in February to secure an LDP majority in the Lower House. The view here would be that, if successful, she could pivot more towards super-loose fiscal and monetary policy \u2013 weakening the yen. Given Japanese CPI should be subdued in the first quarter, this looks the most likely window for 160/162 in USD/JPY.\n- That said, we suspect Tokyo would still intervene at 160. You never know, but the US could join them in bilateral intervention since it would be in Washington\u2019s interests as well.\n- The case for the yen to recover on undervaluation is weakening.\nGBP/USD: Positioning and BoE provide temporary relief\n- Sterling is enjoying a brief renaissance, helped by the Bank of England which was less than dovish in December, and a buyside which had found themselves heavily short sterling in late November. On the BoE story, we favour two further 25bp cuts in March and June in the 3.75% policy rate. Headline inflation should be falling below 2% in April and the BoE should have less to fear over sticky wage inflation \u2013 a key worry for them in December.\n- Also helping sterling has been a UK government trying to get a little closer to Europe, with the focus now on \u2018dynamic alignment\u2019.\n- There is still a risk that PM Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves could be forced out after local elections in May \u2013 a big \u00a3 negative.\nEUR/JPY: Hard to fight this powerful trend\n- Looking at the potential forces driving the euro and yen this year it is hard to stand in the way of this powerful bull trend. On the yen side, PM Sakaichi\u2019s policies are yen-negative and the next Bank of Japan rate hike may not emerge until December. On the euro side, we are looking for a better year here, where fiscal stimulus powers eurozone growth higher sequentially. 200 seems an impossible number for EUR/JPY \u2013 but we traded close in 1990.\n- The Japanese have a bigger problem with a weak yen than the European Central Bank has with a strong euro.

                "body": "GBP/USD forecast: Attention shifts to US data again\nThe GBP/USD bounced back modestly on Wednesday morning session as the dollar index eased back a little, ahead of the release of some important US data in the afternoon. The US dollar has had a positive last few days, which has added a bit of pressure on the GBP/USD and other major pairs. As well as mixed US data, the dollar recovery has also coincided with the rebound in oil prices, owing to the situation in Iran and other geopolitical risk factors concerning Venezuela and Greenland. Though CPI was a touch weaker, this didn\u2019t have any major influence on the US dollar yesterday. Neither did news that the Department of Justice had launched a probe into Jerome Powell. But the pushback from several Republican lawmakers have eased concerns about risks to the independence of the Federal Reserve. All eyes will now turn to the PPI and retail sales data, due shortly, which could further influence the GBP/USD forecast.\nUS PPI and Jobless Claims up next\nFollowing news of a slightly weaker US core CPI print, there will be more inflation data to come today with the release of PPI. Both headline and core PPI are expected to print +0.2% month-over-month. Meanwhile, retail sales are also landing later on today, followed by jobless claims on Thursday along with several Fed speakers. Between September to November, retail sales grew only 0.2%, underscoring recent concerns about consumption. But shopping for Christmas may have given sales a boost in December, although it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to lift concerns about a struggling US consumer. Retail sales for December are expected to print +0.5% on the headline front and +0.4% on the core front.\nOne other potentially market moving event that investors will need to be watching is the Supreme Court ruling on Trump\u2019s tariffs. A potentially unfavourable ruling could emerge at some point this week and that may lend further support to the dollar.\nGBP/USD forecast also weighed down by BoE rate cut expectations\nLooking at the pound side of things for the GBP/USD pair, the focus remains firmly on the Bank of England and interest rate cuts. Recent UK data suggests a cooling economy and easing inflationary pressures, keeping the door open to further rate cuts. While February still looks a step too far, the balance of evidence suggests March is increasingly plausible, potentially followed by another move in early summer.\nThe labour market remains a key concern for the more cautious members of the MPC. Vacancies have fallen sharply and now sit below pre-pandemic levels, while redundancies appear to be picking up. Wage growth has slowed noticeably, with private sector pay increases dropping from around 6% earlier last year to just under 4% by the autumn. If this trend continues, services inflation should ease further as food prices, rents and energy costs all cool. Base effects from last year\u2019s tax changes are also likely to push headline inflation lower from April onwards, potentially keeping CPI close to 2% for much of the year.\nWe will have some UK data to look forward to on Thursday. UK monthly GDP estimate will be released alongside several other domestic data, including construction output and industrial production.\nGBP/USD technical analysis\nThe GBP/USD forecast has started look a bit shaky in recent days, though it has managed to hold for the time being above the key 1.3400 handle. The prior bullish momentum has clearly faded following the rejection from the 1.35 area, which coincides with a broader long-term resistance zone. The lack of upside follow-through suggests bullish conviction is waning. If we now see rates hold below the 1.34 handle, where the 200-day moving average comes into play, then this would shift the balance towards a deeper corrective phase with the location of the next support not very obvious. The 1.3220 level could be where dip-buyers might step in next. On the topside, initial resistance is seen around 1."

The GBP/USD trades at 1.3461 up by 0.30%.\nSterling extends gains as political pressure on the Federal Reserve outweighs strong US data releases\nThe US Dollar reversed course on Wednesday amid Fed\u2019s independence threats by the Trump administration. On Sunday, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the accusations are \u201cpretexts\u201d by the White House who\u2019s not happy that the central bank is setting interest rates \u201cbased on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\u201d\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the buck\u2019s value versus six currencies, is down 0.20% at 98.97.\nInflation on the producer\u2019s side revealed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the November\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) print came at 3% up from October\u2019s 2.8%, exceeding forecasts of 2.7%. At the same time core PPI for the same period also hit 3% up from 2.9% in the previous month, above forecasts of 2.7%.\nAt the same time, Retail Sales in November exceeded forecasts of 0.4%, rose by 0.6% MoM, improving from a 0.1% contraction in October, boosted by a rebound of motor vehicle sales and household spending.\nAccording to the data, expectations that the Federal Reserve would hold rates unchanged at the January meeting are at 95%, according to Prime Market Terminal. However, money markets are still seeing the Fed funds rate ending at 3.23%, implying that they are projecting 52 basis points of ease, towards the end of the year.\nFederal Reserve policymakers cross the wires\nThe Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said that Trump\u2019s Fed actions are related to monetary policy. He still sees a rate cut but says that it is too soon. Chicago\u2019s Fed Austan Goolsbee said that central bank independence is key to low prices, while Philadelphia\u2019s Ana Paulson says that modest cuts \u201care likely appropriate later this year\u201d if forecasts are met.\nOn breaking news, the US Supreme Court announced that it would not rule on tariffs today.\nAcross the pond, the UK docket was light with traders waiting for the release of GDP figures on Thursday. Bank of England\u2019s Taylor said that he expects policy to normalize \u201cat neutral sooner rather than later, as I said on the December minutes.\u201d He added that further rate cuts are in his outlook.\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nThe GBP/USD daily chart suggests that the pair is neutral biased. Momentum is also neutralizing as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near its neutral level, slightly above it.\nFor a bullish continuation, the pair must clear January 13 high of 1.3494 to extend its gains past 1.3500 with traders targeting January 6 cycle high at 1.3567. A breach of it and the 1.3600 is up next. Conversely, the GBP/USD tumbles below 1.3400 and it would improve sellers\u2019 chances as the 200-day SMA lies at 1.3392. If broken, this could exacerbate a drop towards the 50-day SMA at 1.3305.\nPound Sterling Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies this week.

The pair loses ground after Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations were released. The January reading edged down to 4.6% from 4.7% in the previous month, indicating that households continue to anticipate elevated price pressures.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept the cash rate unchanged at 3.6% for a third consecutive meeting in December. Policymakers acknowledged that inflation has eased markedly from its 2022 peak, although recent data point to renewed momentum. Headline inflation slowed to 3.4% YoY in November, the lowest since August, but it remains above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range.\nThe US Census Bureau reported on Wednesday that Retail Sales rose more than expected to $735.9 billion in November, up 0.6%, following a 0.1% contraction in October and beating market expectations of a 0.4% increase. Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in hot in November, with both headline and core measures reaching 3% year-over-year (YoY). Traders will monitor the weekly US Initial Jobless Claims report later on Thursday, alongside remarks from Federal Reserve officials.\nData released last week showed the US Unemployment Rate edged lower to 4.4% in December. Together, these releases strengthen the case for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep interest rates on hold for the next several months, potentially lending support to the US Dollar (USD). Morgan Stanley analysts subsequently pushed back their expectations for rate cuts to June and September from January and April, following Friday\u2019s jobs report.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian"

Headline CPI rose 3.4% year-on-year (YoY), below forecasts of around 3.7%, easing from 3.8% in the prior month, while the trimmed mean, the RBA's preferred gauge, eased to 3.2% YoY from 3.3%.\nAlthough both measures remain above the RBA's 2% \u2013 3% target band, the moderation in November after several hotter prints provided relief, prompting markets to temper expectations for an aggressive RBA tightening cycle in 2026.\nAlso contributing to the Australian dollar's retreat was the US dollar finding support late last week after the December US non-farm payrolls report was not as disappointing as feared. Non-farm payrolls rose by 50,000, softer than expected but not disastrous, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5%, better than the 4.6% forecast.\nThis virtually eliminated all expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut at the late-January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, lending support to the US dollar.\nOutlook for AUD/USD\nLooking ahead, whether AUD/USD extends its correction from the 0.6766 peak this week will depend on risk sentiment over the coming days. Key catalysts include major US bank earnings from Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, along with US producer price index (PPI) and retail sales data, which could influence Fed expectations and broader risk appetite.\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nThe retreat from the overnight 0.6727 high has left a potential head and shoulders topping pattern in AUD/USD.\nWhile head and shoulders topping patterns aren\u2019t typically significant, this one is notable because it is forming against multi-month trend channel resistance in the 0.6750 \u2013 0.6770 area.\nIf AUD/USD now sees a sustained break of the neckline of the head and shoulders at approximately 0.6665 \u2013 0.6660, it would indicate that AUD/USD has formed a medium-term top at last week\u2019s 0.6766 high. Such a breakdown would project an initial move lower towards support in the 0.6550 \u2013 0.6590 range.\nAUD/USD daily candlestick chart\n- Source: TradingView.

                "body": "AUD/USD holds steady as US data, Chinese support balance outlook\n|- US Retail Sales surprise to the upside in November, reinforcing the view of a still resilient economy.\n- US inflation figures strengthen expectations of a steady policy stance from the Federal Reserve.\n- The Australian Dollar finds support from Chinese data and firmer expectations toward the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nAUD/USD trades around 0.6680 on Wednesday at the time of writing, virtually unchanged on the day, as investors digest a series of key macroeconomic releases from the United States (US) and Asia.\nOn the US side, Retail Sales rose by 0.6% in November, well above market expectations of 0.4%, following a 0.1% contraction in October. These figures, published by the US Census Bureau, point to resilient household demand. At the same time, the Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 3% YoY in November, exceeding expectations, while core PPI also rose by 3% annually. On the consumer side, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 2.7% YoY in December, in line with forecasts, while core inflation came in at 2.6%, slightly below expectations.\nThis set of data reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting. Market pricing continues to suggest that the first rate cut is unlikely before mid-year, providing fundamental support to the US Dollar (USD).\nIn Australia, the Australian Dollar (AUD) draws additional support from developments in China. China\u2019s Trade Balance posted a surplus of $114.1 billion in December, exceeding expectations and supporting currencies sensitive to Chinese growth dynamics, such us the Aussie. Domestically, Australian housing data also underpin the currency. Building Permits surged 15.2% MoM in November to 18,406 units, a near four-year high, marking a sharp rebound after the previous month\u2019s decline.\nPersistent strength in housing demand could keep the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cautious on inflation dynamics, despite a recent moderation in consumer price pressures. This backdrop fuels expectations that monetary policy could remain restrictive for longer than previously anticipated, offering structural support to the Australian Dollar.\nOverall, the AUD/USD pair remains in a wait-and-see mode, caught between still-solid US fundamentals and region-specific factors favoring the Australian Dollar, as investors look for fresh macroeconomic catalysts to drive a clearer directional move.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

It certainly seems like doing both would be a challenge and with a weak Yen continuing to push the potential for higher levels of inflation, bond holders have been demanding higher yields to hold Japanese government debt. This likely stand-off has already produced a number of headlines and articles and theories as to why one or the other should begin to come down, but the reality is we\u2019re breaking fresh ground here and there\u2019s not a historical template that can be applied. And perhaps more importantly, this isn\u2019t something where we can speculate on the end game as there\u2019s several steps along the way.\nBut, like I talked about back in December before the BoJ hiked rates and USD/JPY extended its run, this is something that policymakers can take a creative approach towards addressing.\nIn Japanese yields, we can see 10 year JGB\u2019s in a parabolic fashion ever since the election of Sanae Takaichi, rushing from around 1.6-1.7% up to the current level approaching 2.2%.\nJapanese 10-Year Government Bond Yields\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nA Rock and a Hard Place\nTakaichi has previously called rate hikes out of the BoJ \u2018stupid,\u2019 and for an economy that\u2019s worked through almost four decades of deflation and disinflation it\u2019s a difficult argument to support, purposefully tightening policy in order to stem possible inflationary pressure. This is one reason that Yen-weakness themes have been so pronounced in the Abenomics run of 2012 and more recently in the 2021-2022 carry trade fueled USD/JPY rally from 102 up to the 160.00 handle.\nBut the Ministry of Finance is less concerned about the big picture growth concern and more concerned with Japanese Yen spot rates and the potential for runaway inflation should the currency continue falling in such an aggressive fashion. Over the past three-and-a-half years, those intervention efforts have produced a number of pullbacks, such as the initial defense of 150 back in 2022, or the 160 defense in 2024.\nNotably, these intervention efforts are more like band aids, as the fundamental bias that built the trend in the first place remains in order; and the intervention simply drove a pullback that allowed bulls to get long at better prices. This is what explains the rally re-starting in January of 2023, or again around early-2024 until, eventually, bulls were able to break well-above 150 and run up to 160, at which point the MoF ordered another intervention but this time to defend 160. That brought about a week of weakness, with bulls simply loading up again on a re-test of the 151.95 level that had set the high in 2022 and 2023. It didn\u2019t take long before buyers were up to another fresh high in July of 2024 and that\u2019s when another major factor came to light.\nUSD/JPY Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nThe July 2024 Episode Produces a Cautionary Tale\nIt was after the failed intervention in early-2024 that the Ministry of Finance wanted to leave their mark. On the morning of July 11th that year, with a US CPI print set to be released, the Bank of Japan stood at the ready to once again intervene in markets by selling USD and buying JPY, essentially doing the exact opposite of what their very own monetary policy was encouraging at the time.\nThat CPI print came out below expectations and finally, it seemed as though there was an open door for the Fed to cut rates later in the year, and that combined with intervention efforts to pose a startling sell-off in the USD/JPY pair.\nThe problem is that it wasn\u2019t only USD/JPY that was going down on the news, as US equities started to sell-off as well. It started with the high-flying AI trade and the Nasdaq index, but a week later, the S&P 500 topped "

                "body": "USD/JPY Today, January 15: Yen Rebounds From 18-Mo Low on Intervention Threats\nUSD/JPY today bounced after Japan warned FX speculators, lifting the yen from an 18\u2011month low. For Hong Kong, this move matters because HKD is pegged to USD, so HKD/JPY shifts with the pair. Travel budgets, import costs, and regional risk assets can move quickly when yen intervention risk rises. With key U.S. data and Federal Reserve commentary ahead, we expect choppy sessions. We break down drivers, HK implications, trading setups, and a practical Japanese yen forecast for the near term.\nWhy the yen bounced on January 15\nJapan\u2019s Ministry of Finance signaled readiness to act if moves turn one-sided, which raised yen intervention risk and squeezed bearish positions. Verbal warnings alone can spark short covering when positioning is crowded. Coverage highlighted that the yen rebounded from an 18\u2011month low after these remarks, reminding traders of prior action in 2024 and 2025. See reporting here: Japanese yen rebounds from 18-month low against dollar.\nRate gaps still favor the dollar as U.S. yields stay above Japan\u2019s. The Bank of Japan has moved carefully, and talk around domestic politics and possible elections adds uncertainty. Without a clear policy shift, rallies can fade once warnings pass. USD/JPY today remains sensitive to risk sentiment and U.S. data. Another official comment, or silence, could swing the pair in either direction.\nWhat USD/JPY means for Hong Kong investors\nBecause HKD is pegged to USD, HKD/JPY usually tracks USD/JPY today. A stronger dollar makes yen cheaper for Hong Kong residents, supporting travel and purchases from Japan in HKD terms. A sudden yen rebound can reverse those savings. Importers and retailers should review pricing windows and payment schedules. Households planning trips can consider booking sooner if they expect further official pushback that could lift the yen.\nUSD/JPY today is a proxy for global risk appetite through the carry trade. Sharp yen moves can jolt Asian equities, including Hong Kong listings with Japan exposure in retail, autos, and consumer electronics. Higher volatility can widen bid-ask spreads and weigh on brokers and structured products. Investors should track sector moves and liquidity. If swings intensify, we may see short-term de-risking across the region before clarity from U.S. speakers and data.\nTrading setup and risk management\nTraders in Hong Kong often monitor the JPY=X live rate alongside Treasury yields. Into upcoming U.S. data and Federal Reserve remarks, option expiries and headlines can spark fast moves. USD/JPY today tends to react first to official language out of Tokyo, then to U.S. rates. Keep alerts on, trade smaller sizes, and avoid entering during thin liquidity, where slippage can turn a good idea into a poor exit.\nFor portfolios with yen receipts or payments, consider rolling forwards or simple options to cap downside. Equity investors can use index futures to manage beta during USD/JPY today spikes. Diversifying entry points helps reduce timing risk. Set clear stop losses and review margin usage twice a day when volatility rises. If uncertainty increases, shorten holding periods and keep cash buffers for potential margin calls.\nJapanese yen forecast and scenarios\nA stronger yen could follow softer U.S. growth, easing inflation, and clearer signals of Fed rate cuts. A firmer Bank of Japan stance or actual currency buying would add fuel. In that setup, USD/JPY today could retreat, pressuring carry trades and lifting hedged Japanese assets in HK portfolios. Bloomberg reported that Japan warned speculators after the new low, underscoring the near-term risk: Japan Warns Speculators on FX.\nIf U.S. inflation proves sticky and yields stay firm, while the Bank of Japan remains cautious, the dollar can regain upside. Lack of follow-through after warnings may invite fresh selling of the yen. In that case, USD/JPY today could grind higher, favoring carry trades and cheaper Japan pu"

The yen\u2019s slide looks home grown, raising two big questions: does Tokyo really want a stronger currency\u2014and would BOJ intervention even work?\n- Yen weakness largely reflects domestic politics and fiscal stimulus expectations\n- Steeper JGB curves highlight market bets on Abenomics-style reflation\n- Past interventions followed rapid moves, not particular levels\n- Intervention would counter Tokyo\u2019s inflation and growth goals,\nSummary\nSpeculation over yen intervention is heating up again as USD/JPY creeps back toward the same danger zone that triggered action in 2024. But this time feels different. Back then, ballooning rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan were the villain. Now, the yen\u2019s slide looks home grown, tied to domestic politics and policy expectations rather than global carry dynamics.\nTalk of a snap lower house election in Japan later this month has added fuel, with traders gaming out a landslide win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaishi and the prospect of aggressive fiscal stimulus. That has reignited chatter about an Abenomics 2.0 reboot, sending both the yen and JGBs, especially the long end, lower in tandem. The correlation between USD/JPY and the Japanese 2s10s curve has spiked, reflecting bets that reflationary policies could be back in vogue.\nAgainst that backdrop, the question is not just whether intervention would work beyond a short-term jolt. It is whether Tokyo even wants a stronger yen if the goal is to turbocharge growth and inflation.\nPrior Intervention Episodes: A Quick Primer\nSource: TradingView\nThe first chart provides context as to what happened prior to recent intervention episodes. It plots USD/JPY with markers showing how far the pair ran beforehand. The contrast is stark. Ahead of the 2024 action above 160, USD/JPY surged almost 10% in a matter of weeks, with later episode following a move of nearly 5%. Compare that to now: barely 3% so far. It is a tiddler, which raises the question of whether the move is big enough to force the Ministry of Finance\u2019s hand.\nHistory from 2022 reinforces the point. Those interventions came after rapid run-ups of 12% and 8%, respectively, measured in weeks not months. If speed matters more than absolute levels, as recent MoF behaviour suggests, it may require a quick extension into the low 160s to trigger action.\nWe have heard plenty of jawboning from Japanese government officials lately, but most of it repeats the same lines: rapid one-sided moves are undesirable, and price should reflect fundamentals. Nothing yet screams imminent intervention if history is any guide. Expect one more round of forceful language before any real move occurs.\nThat brings us to the bigger question: even if the BOJ is asked to act, would it work? The yen\u2019s latest slide looks home grown, driven by domestic politics and reflation bets rather than global rate differentials. That makes any intervention a ultra short-term shock at best, not a trend changer in my opinion.\nDomestic Drivers: JGBs and Steeper Curves\nThe next two charts speak volumes. The first shows Japanese government bond yields across 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 30-year and 40-year tenors over the past six months. Every line is pointing higher, led by the back end as term premium ratchets up. Traders are positioning for heavier fiscal outlays to spur growth alongside wage and inflation pressures.\nSource: TradingView\nThe second chart adds to the story. Both the 2s10s (LHS) and 2s30s (RHS) curves have steepened dramatically on Abenomics 2.0 speculation. 2s10s sits at 102 basis points, the widest since 2011. 2s30s is at 234 basis points, the most since 2004. These figures are simply the differential between short and longer-dated Japanese government bond yields. These moves underline growing concern about Japan\u2019s already record sovereign debt burden. Prior reflationary pushes hav"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar has remained steady against the US Dollar, showing a slight increase as it consolidates after a decline in December. A recovery in oil prices is providing some support to the Canadian currency, while interest rate differentials are narrowing, which recently favoured a weaker CAD.\nUSD/CAD\u2019s rally appears to have paused below key technical resistance levels, including trend resistance at the 50-day moving average of 1.3887 and the psychologically important 1.39 level. The RSI is declining from recent highs, indicating easing momentum.\nNear Term Domestic Risks\nNear-term domestic risks seem limited, with no scheduled Bank of Canada speeches before the next rate decision. The currency is expected to remain range-bound, moving between 1.3820 and 1.3920.\nAdditional FX insights and market observations are available through the FXStreet Insights Team, composed of journalists and analysts who contribute to a broader understanding of current market trends. The information is presented for informational purposes, advising thorough research before making financial decisions.\nThe Canadian dollar is holding its ground against the US dollar, trading in a narrow range after falling from its late December highs. We are seeing a recovery in oil prices, which is giving the CAD some underlying support. Critically, interest rate differentials are also turning in our favor, tightening after a period of widening late last year.\nThe Bank of Canada is now expected to be more cautious about cutting rates after Canada\u2019s latest CPI reading for December 2025 came in at 2.9%, slightly above expectations. This contrasts with signals from the US Federal Reserve, which appears more prepared to ease policy. At the same time, WTI crude has stabilized above $85 per barrel, adding to the positive outlook for the loonie.\nHistorical Patterns Observed\nLooking back, we saw the USD/CAD rally stall in late 2025 just below the key 1.3600 resistance level, which aligns with the 200-day moving average. For derivative traders, this suggests that call options with strikes above 1.3600 could be attractive to sell, capitalizing on the strong resistance. Momentum indicators like the RSI have rolled over from overbought territory, signaling that the upward push is losing steam.\nGiven this setup, we see a near-term range for the pair between 1.3350 and 1.3550. Traders could consider establishing put option spreads to position for a gradual move lower toward the 1.3350 support level. This strategy limits risk while providing exposure to potential CAD strength leading into the Bank of Canada\u2019s next meeting on January 25th.\nWe also note that historical patterns often show the Canadian dollar strengthening toward the end of January. This seasonal tendency provides an additional tailwind for strategies that are bullish on the CAD."

The pair holds ground as the US Dollar (USD) receives support from stronger-than-expected US economic data. Traders will monitor the weekly US Initial Jobless Claims report later on Thursday, alongside remarks from Federal Reserve officials.\nThe US Census Bureau reported on Wednesday that Retail Sales rose more than expected to $735.9 billion in November, up 0.6%, following a 0.1% contraction in October and beating market expectations of a 0.4% increase. Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in hot in November, with both headline and core measures reaching 3% year-over-year (YoY).\nTogether with last week\u2019s data showing the US Unemployment Rate easing to 4.4% in December, these releases reinforce the case for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep interest rates on hold for the coming months, potentially supporting the US Dollar (USD). In response, Morgan Stanley analysts delayed their expectations for rate cuts to June and September from January and April following Friday\u2019s jobs report.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from higher Oil prices, given the status of Canada\u2019s largest crude exporter to the United States (US). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price is trading around $60.20 at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices gain ground amid persistent tensions in Iran. Traders will closely monitor the latest geopolitical developments surrounding the Iranian civil unrest.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. Thi"

The Yen is showing the weakest performance among major currencies this week, with investors so far unfazed by the looming intervention threats by Japanese authorities.\nThe Yen has tumbled on Wednesday after a local newspaper reported that Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi would be considering dissolving the lower house next week and calling snap elections on February 8.\nTakaichi trade crushes the Yen\nInvestors fear that the elections' outcome might provide Takaichi with a wider parliamentary support to continue her policy of large stimulus and low interest rates in a country with an already high fiscal deficit. This has fuelled a new wave of the so-called \u201cTakaichi trade\u201d consisting of selling JPY and long-term Japanese Government Bonds (JGB).\nJapan\u2019s finance minister Satsuki Katayama affirmed on Tuesday that she and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are concerned about \u201cone-sided depreciation\u201d in the Yen. The market, however, sees the possibility of an upcoming election as a significant hindrance to an FX intervention and keeps selling the Yen across the board.\nThe Pound, on the other hand, remains fairly bid in a calm market session, awaiting the monthly Gross Domestic Product report, due on Thursday. The market is forecasting 0.1% rebound of economic growth in December, after a 0.1% drop in November.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

A 0.1% economic growth increase in December is predicted, recovering from a 0.1% decline in November.\nJapan\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies continue to influence the Yen\u2019s performance. The shift from ultra-loose monetary policy by the Bank of Japan is narrowing the bond differential with the US. The Japanese Yen is often viewed as a safe haven during market volatility due to its perceived stability.\nWith GBP/JPY trading near all-time highs, we see the path of least resistance as upwards in the near term. The primary driver is the profound weakness in the Japanese Yen, sparked by the news of potential snap elections on February 8. This political uncertainty should keep the Yen under pressure for the next several weeks.\nThe market is aggressively pricing in a victory for Prime Minister Takaichi, which would likely mean more economic stimulus and a continued dovish stance from the Bank of Japan. We\u2019ve seen this \u201cTakaichi trade\u201d before, and it consistently leads to a weaker Yen as investors anticipate prolonged low interest rates. Recent data showing Japan\u2019s core inflation falling back to 1.8% in December 2025 only reinforces the view that there is no rush for the central bank to tighten policy.\nMarket Anticipation Strategies\nOn the other side of the trade, the Pound Sterling is holding firm ahead of tomorrow\u2019s monthly GDP report. The market expects a modest 0.1% rebound, which, if met or exceeded, would add fuel to the GBP/JPY rally. After a challenging year for the UK economy in 2025, any sign of stability is being treated as a positive for the currency.\nWhile Japanese officials are voicing concern about the Yen\u2019s decline, we believe the chance of direct currency intervention before the election is low. Looking back, we saw major interventions in 2022 when the currency weakened significantly, but doing so during an election campaign would be politically risky. The market seems to agree and is currently ignoring these verbal threats.\nFor derivative traders, this situation suggests buying call options on GBP/JPY with expirations after the February 8 election date. This strategy allows us to profit from further upside in the pair while capping our potential loss at the premium paid. We are positioning for the pair to test and break above the recent 214.30 high.\nThe uncertainty has caused one-month implied volatility in GBP/JPY to surge past 14%, reflecting market anticipation of a significant price move. This makes options more expensive but also underscores the potential for sharp gains. A break above the recent highs could trigger a rapid move towards the 215.00 level and beyond."

At time of publication, Bitcoin is up 3.3% in the past 24 hours to trade just under $95,000, according to CoinGecko data.\n\u201cPrice is leading narratives and flows,\u201d Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, told Decrypt. \u201cA breakout above $91,000 after weeks of consolidation has triggered the recent push.\u201d\nFidelity\u2019s FBTC led the inflows with a $351.36 million netflow. Bitwise\u2019s BITB and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT followed closely with $159.42 million and $126.27 million netflows, respectively.\nThe buying pressure boosted total net assets across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to approximately $123 billion, roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s $1.89 trillion market cap.\nCan momentum be sustained?\nThe sustainability of this momentum into Q1 remains a key question, with Kazmierczak pointing out that ETF flows have become volatile and that elevated interest rates keep opportunity costs high for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin.\nHe suggested institutional demand this quarter is likely to be \u201cmore selective and cautious rather than acting as a catalyst for sharp breakouts.\u201d\nThe momentum spilled over into the broader crypto market, lifting its total capitalization by 3.3% to $3.32 trillion.\nAltcoins including XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin rose 2% to 6%, buoyed in part by optimism around a new draft crypto market structure bill that could grant them clearer regulatory status.\nBarthere noted that the bill's advance in the Senate Banking Committee is providing a supportive \"narrative perspective\" for the market.\nAnalysts see the proposed legislation, which could classify certain altcoins as \"non-ancillary\" assets like Bitcoin, as a potential paradigm shift.\n\u201cIf passed, the bill could drive institutional inflows into altcoins while pushing other tokens to chase ETFs as a \u2018survival hack,\u2019\u201d said Ryan Yoon, senior analyst at Tiger Research.\nYoon tempered that outlook by highlighting the political path ahead, noting that \u201cthis shift shows regulators care more about the \u2018product wrapper\u2019 than the tech itself, though 2026 election politics and SEC-CFTC turf wars remain the real hurdles to this becoming law.\u201d\nDespite near-term caution, a structurally bullish case remains.\n\u201cBitwise expects ETFs to buy more than all the new Bitcoin coming onto the market in 2026,\u201d Kazmierczak said, a dynamic that could create straightforward supply-demand support as ETF assets are projected to grow significantly by year-end."

                "body": "Ethereum Outlook Has Improved, And It Could Outperform Bitcoin \u2013 Here\u2019s What To Know\nEthereum\u2019s outlook has been improving its case. After a prolonged period of underperformance and skepticism, the network is starting to exhibit signs of renewed structural and fundamental strength. While BTC continues to anchor the market as the primary store of value and digital gold, conditions are emerging that could allow ETH to outperform BTC over the coming period.\nWhy The Ethereum Narrative Is Gaining Strength\nEthereum has been seen outperforming Bitcoin. In a recent post on X, Walter Bloomberg revealed that Standard Chartered says that the ETH outlook has improved, and now ETH might outperform BTC, citing rising institutional demand and stronger fundamental positioning across key on-chain sectors.\nWhile weakness in BTC has weighed on the broader crypto market, ETH has continued to benefit from institutional-driven demand, and its dominance in stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.\nStandard Chartered also points to the increased throughput and potential US regulatory clarity that it could provide additional upside. In terms of valuation, the bank forecasts ETH at $7,500 this year and $30,000 by 2029, reflecting the expectations of sustained network growth.\nThe Co-founder of PinkBrains_io, a DeFi Creator Studio, DefiIgnas, has highlighted that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin this year, and the reason is roadmap execution. While BTC will likely keep facing recurring waves of quantum FUD into 2026, ETH has a clear roadmap to prepare for future cryptographic risks.\nFurthermore, ETH is actually scaling. Gas limits on layer 1 keep rising, and zkEVMs will get full production readiness, making ETH cheap and fast enough for high-value transactions, while layer 2s will handle most of the trading and high-frequency activity.\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Structure Points To Crypto Winter \u2013 Details\nThese upgrades are incremental, which means there\u2019s no breaking news moment for ETH, but progress is happening fast. Early in the cycle, a lot of Degens loaded up on ETH before the bull run, but many got disillusioned and sold their ETH for BTC. \u201cIt would be fun to see the playbook reverse higher,\u201d DefiIgnas noted.\nA Different Liquidity Cycle Than Previous Bull Markets\nCrypto liquidity quality witnessed a change in 2025. A technical analyst and show host of Crypto Banter, Kyledoops, reported that Wintermute noted that capital in 2025 stopped rotating broadly across the market. Instead, liquidity is concentrated into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a small group of large-cap tokens. As a result, the long-anticipated wave of altcoin-wide liquidity never really arrived.\nMeanwhile, the rise of spot ETFs and crypto treasury vehicles created a new, highly structured inflow channel that funneled flow into the top of the market. These vehicles break the crypto\u2019s oldest playbooks. Price action is no longer driven by broad market expansion. It\u2019s driven by where new liquidity can actually enter."

                "body": "Bitcoin Powers to 2-Month Peak: Unpacking the BTC Rally, ETH Momentum, and XRP Trends\nIntroduction to the Latest\nThe crypto market is buzzing again.\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets that use strong cryptography to secure transactions, control new unit creation, and verify transfers. They act like money but run on blockchain tech, free from banks. Bitcoin started it all in 2009. Ethereum joined in 2015, powering smart contracts. XRP launched in 2012 for fast cross-border payments.\nThese coins are high-risk investments due to price swings. But they offer big potential rewards. Let\u2019s break down the recent moves and what they mean.\nBitcoin\u2019s Strong Recovery: Up 9% Year-to-Date\nBitcoin, the king of crypto, keeps proving its staying power. Born as the first decentralized digital money, BTC has grown from niche experiment to global asset. Its price is volatile, but that resilience shines through tough times.\nThis week, BTC\u2019s closing price rose steadily, hitting a <2-month peak>. It\u2019s now up about 9% since the start of the year. Still, it sits 24% below its all-time high from October 2025. Why the surge? Growing investor trust, plus big news like ETF approvals, fuels the fire.\nFor new investors, Bitcoin basics are key: It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it scarce like gold. Miners secure the network. Halvings every four years cut new supply, often sparking rallies.\n- Key BTC Stats:\n- Market leader with biggest share.\n- Year-to-date gain: ~9%.\n- Distance to ATH: 24% down.\n- Recent high: 2 months best.\nThis rally could signal more upside if market sentiment stays positive.\nEthereum\u2019s Steady Climb: Second Week of Gains\nEthereum powers the ETH token and hosts the world\u2019s top blockchain for apps and DeFi. Launched in July 2015, ETH holds the number two spot by market cap.\nETH\u2019s price rose again this week, marking two straight weeks up. It reached a one-month high. Year-to-date, it\u2019s up around 12%, but 31% below its August 2025 record.\nWhat sets ETH apart? Smart contracts let developers build dApps, NFTs, and more. Upgrades like the Merge made it greener and faster. ETH\u2019s growth ties to the booming Web3 ecosystem.\n- ETH Highlights:\n- Second-largest market share.\n- YTD performance: ~12% up.\n- From peak: 31% below.\n- Trend: 1-month high.\nWith ETH ETFs now live, easier access could drive even more gains.\nXRP\u2019s Role in the Mix\nXRP, from Ripple, focuses on quick, cheap global payments. Launched in 2012, it was a top coin early on. Newer rivals have challenged it, but XRP fights back with real-world use cases.\nWhile BTC and ETH lead headlines, XRP adds diversity. Its price history shows big swings, but partnerships with banks keep it relevant.\nInvestors watch XRP for regulatory wins and adoption news.\nTracking All Three: The Crypto Index Chart\nTo compare BTC, ETH, and XRP fairly, we use a custom index. It starts from November 9, 2017, with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. This shows percentage changes and long-term growth, not raw dollars.\nAll three have led at times. Right now, Bitcoin tops the chart. The index highlights relative strength:\n- Bitcoin: Current leader.\n- Ethereum: Closing the gap.\n- XRP: Holding steady.\nThis view helps spot which coin outperforms over time, guiding portfolio choices.\nThe Game-Changer: Spot ETF Launches\nETFs make crypto easy for traditional investors. No need for wallets or exchanges.\nBitcoin Spot ETFs \u2013 January 10, 2024\nThe SEC greenlit spot BTC ETFs. Top ones include:\n- Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)\n- iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n- Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n- ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n- Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n- Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\nQuick impacts: Billions in inflows, price boosts, mainstream entry.\nEthereum Spot ETFs \u2013 July 23, 2024\nETH followed suit. Key launches:\n- Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)\n- Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET)\n- Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW)\n- iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA)\n- Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH)\nThese ETFs track real ETH"

The Ethereum platform makes it possible to build decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and stablecoin platforms by giving users a strong contract architecture. This is an important thing for investors to think about when looking at ETH USD rates.\nA first-mover advantage\nUnlike some other industries, the crypto market has largely been defined by the first-mover advantage. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and therefore holds significant attention, trust, and valuation in the space. Launched in 2015, Ethereum was the first major smart contract platform blockchain, enabling the development and support of decentralised applications (dApps).\nSince Ethereum moved first, its enablement of programmable money and dApps via smart contracts has positioned the platform as one of the most widely used layer-1 networks in DeFi. Today, the platform hosts thousands of applications that support the growth of its native token. Solana, which stands as the second-largest comparable network, maintains only 30% of Ethereum's market cap.\n\"Ethereum stands apart due to a large and diverse application and developer ecosystem, a large amount of on-chain capital, and a culture that prioritizes decentralization,\" a Greyscale research paper read. \"We expect that these features will continue to draw many users to the Ethereum ecosystem.\"\nCore DeFi functionality of Ethereum\nEthereum is distinguished from other major players in cryptocurrency by its robust DeFi network, widely accessible to any user. It enables the development of decentralized exchanges, lending markets, synthetic assets, stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, and more. Within these DeFi projects, Ethereum's native token is often used as collateral to support the initiative.\nFor instance, a decentralized exchange may allow users to trade one crypto asset for Ethereum, or a DeFi protocol might rely on ETH to suggest legitimacy. Whatever the case may be, the Ethereum platform has effectively ensured that its native token will always have a viable use case as decentralised projects gain momentum.\nConstant technological improvement\nIn order to maintain its position as a market leader in DeFi, Ethereum continues to bolster its core systems. Even now, the platform is actively developing its Fusaka upgrade, aimed at data scaling, denial of service (DoS) defenses, and new developer tools. This latest upgrade was deployed successfully on key testnets in early October and went live on the Hoodi network on October 28. The upgrade is still slated to deploy to the Ethereum mainnet on December 3 of this year.\n\"The software update seeks to cut transaction costs on Ethereum and boost the network's efficiency by further streamlining the process by which it samples and verifies data from layer-2 networks,\" an article published on Yahoo! Finance reads. \"It also includes multiple proposals designed to improve Ethereum's user experience.\"\nNotably, Ethereum has also introduced a proof-of-stake model through its Ethereum 2.0 update, designed to reduce energy usage and improve network stability. Furthermore, innovative layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism are actively enhancing speed on the network and leading to reductions in transaction costs. Ultimately, efficiency is key to success as a DeFi platform.\nFinancial impact and accessibility with Ethereum\nLeading platforms such as Ethereum tend to provide users with key financial tools for navigating DeFi spaces. These may include yield farming, stablecoin trading, and liquidity mining, all of which may be employed without oversight from intermediaries. With some of the most robust tools on the market, Ethereum leverages this advantage to remain at the top of the DeFi industry.\nDue to Ethereum's prominenc"

Citi stock fell 3.4%, while Bank of America declined 3.7% and Wells Fargo pulled back 4.6%.\nBefore the bell, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' delayed Producer Price Index report for November revealed wholesale prices rose 0.2% from September\u2014the last monthly reading before the U.S. government shutdown\u2014while economists were expecting an 0.3% rise. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in November when a 0.4% increase was predicted.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, recently traded below 4.15% at 4 p.m. ET, down from Tuesday's close above 4.18%.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, reversed course and fell 1.6% to $60.15 a barrel after President Donald Trump hinted he could hold off on attacking Iran, something he had threatened in recent days.\nPrices of precious metals surged Wednesday, with gold futures hitting an all-time high of $4,650 an ounce and silver crossing the $90-an-ounce threshold for the first time. Gold was up nearly 1% to $4,635, while silver surged 7.5% to $92.80 after setting a record of more than $93.\nFinancial stocks mostly continued their descent after President Trump over the weekend suggested capping credit card interest rates at 10%, although shares of payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA)\u2014among the biggest S&P 500 decliners yesterday\u2014rebounded mildly, gaining 0.4% each.\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell 1.4% after the Trump administration approved the exporting of its H200 AI chips to China but said the world's most valuable public company must meet new security requirements first.\nNetflix (NFLX) stock slipped 2% following reports that the streaming giant was preparing to make its $72 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) HBO Max streaming service and studios all-cash, instead of a mix of cash and stock. Shares of Paramount Skydance (PSKY), which has made a hostile all-cash offer of $77.9 billion for all of WBD, slipped 0.5%, while WBD stock ended down 0.8%.\nBitcoin was trading around $97,500, up sharply for a second straight day.

                "body": "US stock futures were under pressure for a third consecutive day on Thursday, January 15. Another set of disappointing bank earnings led to profit-taking ahead of the highly anticipated AI-linked earnings.\nFading bets on a March Fed rate cut added to the negative mood as US economic data continued to underscore a robust US economy.\nMeanwhile, concerns about a snap election in Japan and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan continued to weigh on the yen, despite the USD/JPY pulling back from 159. Typically, higher USD/JPY levels fuel yen carry trades into US risk assets.\nNevertheless, optimism about AI-linked earnings, market bets on multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, and a resilient US economy support a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nThe ongoing concerns about the snap election and spending plans remain headwinds for the yen. Meanwhile, Japanese economic data added to the negative sentiment.\nOn January 15, Japanese producer prices increased 2.4% year-on-year in December, down from 2.7% in November, weighing on the yen. USD/JPY climbed 0.04% to 158.497 in morning trading, well below the previous day\u2019s high of 159.454.\nSofter producer prices suggest weakening demand, supporting a less hawkish Bank of Japan rate path. A more dovish BoJ policy stance and Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans suggest continued yen weakness. Easing fears of a yen carry trade unwind support the bullish short- to medium-term price outlook.\nHowever, the USD/JPY breakout above 157 has raised concerns about potential Japanese government yen interventions and the Bank of Japan raising interest rates, weighing on demand for risk assets. A more hawkish BoJ policy stance and narrower US-Japan rate differentials could trigger a yen carry trade unwind.\nUS futures fell during the Asian morning session on January 15. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini dropped 37 points and 8 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini declined 55 points.\nLater Thursday, US jobless claims data will influence the Fed rate path. Economists expect initial jobless claims to increase from 208k in the week ending January 3 to 215k in the week ending January 10. A larger-than-expected increase in jobless claims would revive hopes for a March Fed rate cut, boosting demand for US equity futures.\nCrucially, a more dovish Fed rate path would have a greater influence on US risk assets than the BoJ\u2019s policy stance and a yen carry trade unwind. Typically, lower borrowing costs would raise earnings and equity valuations. Traders should also closely monitor Fed speeches for their views on the timing of rate cuts.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut have fallen from 43.2% on January 7 to 27.2% on January 15. Robust labor market data sank bets on a Q1 rate cut.\nThe current dynamics, including market optimism over AI-related corporate earnings and expectations for an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, support a cautiously bullish near-term and positive medium-term price outlook. However, corporate earnings will be key for the near-term projection. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock are set to release earnings today.\nDespite the extended losses, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini traded above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs indicated bullish momentum, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on corporate earnings, US economic indicators, and Fed rhetoric. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish, supported by hopes for an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and upbeat AI-related corporate earnings. These fundamentals align with constructive technicals.\nFurthermore, ongoing speculation about an incoming Fed Chair being willing to lower interest rates in a st"

JP Morgan fell 4.2% on these worries, and despite posting a Q4 profit beat, although investment banking fees disappointed.\nUS banks' earnings will remain in focus today, keeping banks across Europe in the spotlight.\nMiners are leading the charge higher on the Footsie following the latest data from China, which showed that the trade surplus with the rest of the world reached a record 1.2 trillion in 2025 as exports to the European Union and Southeast Asia surged in response to higher tariffs in the US.\nChina, the world's largest and second-largest economy, reported a trade balance of $1.189 trillion, up from the 2024 record of $993 billion. The strong results are lifting metal prices.\nPrecious metals gold and silver are also trading at record highs after data showed that US inflation remained relatively contained, providing support to miners.\nOn the downside, BP is falling after saying it expects to take an impairment charge of 4 to 5 billion in Q4, mainly related to its energy transition business.\nThe UK economic calendar is quiet; attention will be stateside on US earnings and retail sales. UK GDP data is due tomorrow.\nFTSE forecast- technical analysis\nThe FTSE has trended higher since April, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. The price has rallied above 10k to a fresh record high today of 10,170. The RSI is in overbought territory, which warrants caution.\nBuyers will look to extend gains toward 10,200 and, on to 10,500, as the following logical levels.\nImmediate support is seen at 10k, the psychological level, and 9930, the November high. It would take a break below 9615, the December low, to create a lower low towards 9500.\nUSD/JPY approaches 160.00 on yen weakness\n- Yen weakens on election worries & after a weak bond auction\n- US retail sales data due\n- USD/JPY trades at an 18-month high\nUSD/JPY has risen to an 18-month high, driven by yen weakness as investors weigh up the possibility of a snap election in Japan, which could pave the way for fiscal stimulus. At the same time, the government's auction received a cautious market response.\nThe yen trades at its weakest level since July 2024 following an auction of five-year Japanese government bonds, which attracted weak demand.\nThis comes amid rising bets that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is considering a snap lower house election on February 8th to capitalise on her growing support and increase her majority in the house. This would be negative for the yen, given her dovish stance on fiscal and monetary policy.\nHowever, as the pair approaches 160, traders are on alert for possible intervention by Japanese authorities to prop up the currency.\nThe US dollar is holding steady near a monthly high against its major peers after US CPI data were broadly in line with estimates, supporting expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold this month.\nThe USD recovered losses from Monday, when it fell sharply after Trump threatened to indict Fed Chair Powell, raising questions about Fed independence. Since then, politicians and central bankers have supported Federal Reserve Chair Powell and asserted the central bank's independence, insisting that it cannot be interfered with.\nToday, attention is turning to U.S. retail sales, which are expected to increase 0.4% month over month after a 0% increase in the previous month.\nUSD/JPY forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nUSD/JPY has recovered from the 154.50 December low, risin"

                "body": "Understanding Europe's Current Economic Transformation\nGlobal financial markets are experiencing a fundamental shift in investment patterns as traditional monetary policy frameworks undergo unprecedented recalibration. Central banks across major economies are navigating complex inflationary dynamics while governments implement expansive fiscal measures that reshape competitive landscapes. This convergence of loose monetary conditions and strategic government spending creates powerful investment opportunities, particularly in European markets where structural economic reforms are accelerating industrial modernisation efforts.\nGermany's equity benchmark has emerged as a primary beneficiary of these macro-economic forces, with the DAX 40 record high trajectory reflecting deeper structural changes beyond typical market cycles. Unlike previous rallies driven primarily by earnings growth or valuation expansion, this surge demonstrates how coordinated policy initiatives can fundamentally alter investment flows and sector rotation patterns across developed markets.\nHow Monetary Policy Shifts Drive Market Performance\nCentral Bank Policy Recalibration Creates Investment Opportunities\nEuropean Central Bank officials are increasingly signalling dovish policy adjustments as inflationary pressures moderate across the eurozone. Core inflation metrics have declined more rapidly than anticipated, falling below the ECB's 2% target in several key economies. This disinflationary trend provides substantial policy space for monetary accommodation, with market participants now pricing 75-100 basis points of rate cuts through 2026.\nThe probability of ECB dovish policy pivots has increased dramatically from 30% to 70% over the past six months, reflecting fundamental changes in economic conditions rather than temporary cyclical adjustments. Producer price indices across Germany are showing deflationary pressures in manufacturing sectors, whilst services inflation continues cooling faster than central bank projections suggested.\nCurrency Dynamics Enhance Export Competitiveness\nEuro weakness against major trading partners has created significant competitive advantages for German exporters. The EUR/USD exchange rate decline generates approximately 12% positive earnings impact for export-dependent companies, whilst dollar strength reduces input costs by roughly 8%, expanding operating margins substantially.\nThese currency adjustments extend beyond temporary fluctuations, reflecting structural economic rebalancing that positions German manufacturers advantageously in global markets. Furthermore, Asian market share gains from yen depreciation particularly benefit industrial machinery and automotive sectors, where German companies maintain technological leadership positions.\nFiscal Policy Innovation Drives Structural Growth\nInfrastructure Investment Programs Transform Economic Foundations\nGerman government officials have announced comprehensive infrastructure modernisation initiatives totalling \u20ac500 billion over five years. This represents approximately 2.1% of GDP annually, creating substantial multiplier effects across construction, materials, and engineering sectors. The infrastructure fund implementation requires constitutional debt brake relaxation, providing 0.8% additional fiscal space for counter-cyclical spending measures.\nGreen transition investments comprise a \u20ac200 billion subset of this infrastructure program, specifically targeting industrial modernisation and energy transition insights. These initiatives create sustained demand patterns for German industrial companies whilst enhancing long-term competitiveness through productivity gains and technological advancement.\nDefense Spending Acceleration Creates Multi-Year Growth Cycles\nGeopolitical tensions have prompted dramatic increases in European defence spending, with Germany leading this expansion through sustained procurement programs. Defense industrial companies are experiencing order backlog"

In the US, producer prices rose 0.2% month-on-month in November, lifting the PPI to 150.71 and 3% year-on-year, while core PPI increased 0.2% on the month and 3.5% annually.\nUS mortgage applications surged 28.5% in the week to 9 January, led by a 40% jump in refinancing and a 16.9% rise in purchase applications, as 30-year mortgage rates fell to a 15-month low of 6.18%.\nIn China, the trade surplus reached a record $1.189trn in 2025, w"

                "body": "As the Jets look ahead to April's NFL Draft and potentially adding a bounty of young talent with, at present, eight total picks that includes four selections (including Nos. 2 and 16 in the first round) in the top 44, there's excitement and anticipation at 1 Jets Drive. One of the youngest rosters in the league is poised to get even younger.\nWhat can't be overlooked is how important the seven players taken in the first draft overseen by GM Darren Mougey and HC Aaron Glenn were to the team in the 2025 season. Though several had to deal with injuries (TE Mason Taylor, CB Azareye'h Thomas, LB Kiko Mauigoa and DL Tyler Baron) young men like S Malachi Moore and RT Armand Membou played -- and played well -- in all 17 games.\nMoore Grabbing an Opportunity and Holding On\nWhen opportunity knocked during his rookie season with the Jets, S Malachi Moore opened the door to what has the making of a long and productive career in the NFL.\nMoore (5-11, 197) was the second of the Jets' two fourth-round selections in the 2025 NFL Draft after GM Darren Mougey completed a trade, swapping a fifth- and a sixth-round pick with the Eagles to move up 15 spots for the four-year starter and two-time captain at Alabama.\nHe got his first start of the season at Tampa Bay in Week 3 and then saw time at slot corner, his original position with the Crimson Tide before former coach Nick Saban suggested he move to safety. He got a chance to show his promise at safety when Andre Cisco (torn pectoral), who signed with the Green & White, sustained a season-ending injury in Week 8 at Cincinnati -- the team's first win of the Aaron Glenn era. Moore teamed with Tony Adams until Adams sustained a groin injury in Week 15 that ended his season. Moore stepped in at safety and never left the rest of the season.\n\"I feel like that's the best way to learn is to get thrown into the fire, because nothing is like a real game,\" Moore told team reporter Caroline Hendershot. \"And so when you finally get out there, I feel like the more reps I got, the more comfortable I became out there and just being comfortable with myself around the teammates on the field we were playing. I just think with more reps comes more experience and more confidence.\"\nMoore led all rookie defensive backs with 95 total tackles, 3 TFL, a forced fumble and 3 PDs. In the process he became the first Jets rookie DB with 90-plus tackles in a season in the last 20 years. Moore earned praise and guidance from a guy who wasn't a bad DB himself -- Glenn.\n\"AG, I love him,\" Moore said. \"I love playing for him, he's tough on all of us, but that's because he expects a lot out of us. You don't want anything else from a player. AG, he looks at us and he sees what we could be down in the future and not where we are right now. So that's how he coaches us. And you have nothing but respect and I've had fun playing for Coach AG. He brings energy to the program, to this organization. He wants us to play an old school style of football, fast, physical and violent, and that's what we try to do this year. And next year we'll try to do the same thing.\"\nMauigoa Always in the Moment\nThough he won't be suiting up for Miami in the National Championship game on Jan. 19, LB Francisco (Kiko) Mauigoa played a critical role for the Hurricanes during his two seasons there. After being taken in Round 5 last year, Mauigoa played well in 12 games before sustaining a season-ending neck injury against the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.\n\"The biggest takeaway from this year is just being able to enjoy every single moment, not taking any moment for granted,\" Mauigoa (6-2, 233) said. \"Because although I didn't finish the way I wanted to finish, they go out like that, just like that. So I'm taking every single moment in and soaking all the information in so that I'll be ready for Year 2. So I feel like that's the biggest thing is being able to learn from the vets, the guys that have been here and just be able to take it step by step and prepare for what's "

                "body": "The Happy Hacking Keyboard series has been in production for nearly 30 years. In that time, the keyboards have consistently focused on two things: a signature layout and extensive utility. Nearly all of them have also featured what many enthusiasts consider the star of the show\u2014Topre electro-capacitive switches.\nWith a cultlike following and a fairly simple construction, it can be easy to assume that these keyboards aren\u2019t worth the high price\u2014and they aren't for most people. However, the HHKB brings something unique to the table: A design that has been refined over the years, creating an out-of-the-box experience that can\u2019t be improved. In an age of planned obsolescence and enshittification, a mechanical keyboard like this is hard to find.\nClassic \u201cThock\u201d\nFor the uninitiated, the Topre electro-capacitive switch is \u2026 unique. Some people swear by them, refusing to type on anything else. They're distinctly different from the standard Cherry MX-style switch for a few reasons. They use a rubber dome instead of a spring, they are not hot-swappable, and they are only available as tactile switches. No linear option here.\nTyping on them is unlike any other switch. They have a strong, rounded tactile bump; you press down, there\u2019s a bit of resistance, and instead of an immediate click as the resistance gives way, the switch gradually loses tension. It\u2019s hard to describe, but these switches feel satisfying and comfortable in a way that other tactiles don\u2019t.\nEach switch consists of a keycap, a plastic slider, a rubber dome, and a cone-shaped spring underneath. When you press a key, the slider is pushed down, which then compresses the rubber dome. When the rubber dome compresses, the coils of the spring come closer together, which registers a key input by sensing a change in the surrounding electromagnetic field, an effect called electromagnetic capacitance\u2014the same basic principle modern touchscreens use, although the exact mechanics are different."

                "body": "TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended at record highs for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, with the Nikkei index surpassing 54,000 amid optimism that a victory for the ruling bloc in a possible snap election would bolster Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's aggressive fiscal policies.\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average advanced 792.07 points, or 1.48 percent, from Tuesday to 54,341.23. The broader Topix index finished 45.27 points, or 1.26 percent, higher at 3,644.16. Both indexes also set new intraday record highs.\nStocks have been on the rise since media reports began surfacing late last week that Takaichi, who has pledged to increase spending to spur economic growth, is considering dissolving the House of Representatives on Jan. 23 for an election. But concerns over Japan's fiscal health have weighed on the yen and government bonds.\nThe Japanese currency remained weak in the lower 159 range in Tokyo on Wednesday, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond briefly rose to 2.185 percent, its highest level since February 1999. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nThe yen's weakness, which boosts exporters' overseas profits when repatriated, helped lift exporter shares, with the benchmark Nikkei gaining more than 900 points at one point.\nSemiconductor and defense-related stocks, which are widely viewed as likely to benefit from the Takaichi government's drive to promote investment, were also bought heavily, analysts said.\nYuta Okamoto, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory Co., said \"With Ms. Takaichi's approval ratings remaining high, a snap election could strengthen her political base, making it easier to advance her policies,\" adding, \"It is no wonder that stocks were bought.\"\nOn the top-tier Prime Market, the main gainers were mining, precision instrument and machinery issues.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 159.17-18 yen compared with 159.11-21 yen in New York and 158.93-96 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Tuesday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1646-1647 and 185.38-42 yen against $1.1638-1648 and 185.26-36 yen in New York and $1.1663-1664 and 185.38-42 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday afternoon.\nThe key barometer of long-term interest rates ended up 0.020 percentage point from Tuesday's close at 2.180 percent.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark price of gold set by Tokyo's Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies Co. hit an all-time high of 26,177 yen per gram, driven by the yen's depreciation.\nThe rise also reflected high demand for the safe-haven asset following the recent U.S. seizure of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a military operation and massive anti-government protests in Iran."

The broader Topix .TOPX was more buoyant, rising 0.4%.\nU.S. stocks finished lower overnight, led by a drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq gauge.\nThe yen recovered from a 1-1/2-year low after fresh warnings from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama against \u201cexcessive\u201d moves and a U.S. Treasury statement calling for \u201csound\u201d policy from the Bank of Japan to contend with currency volatility.\n\u201cGiven the recent streak of consecutive record highs, the Japanese stock market is likely to see subdued movement today unless new catalysts emerge,\u201d said Wataru Akiyama, an equities strategist at Nomura Securities. \u201cExport-related stocks are broadly lower due to recent yen appreciation.\u201d\nThere were 137 advancers on the Nikkei against 84 decliners. The largest losers in the index were software services provider Shift 3697.T, down 7.6%, followed by artificial intelligence sector heavyweights SoftBank Group 9984.T and Advantest6857.T, which lost more than 4.5% each.\nThe largest gainers in the index were retailer Ryohin Keikaku 7453.T, up 10%, followed by consulting services provider BayCurrent 6532.T, which jumped 5.1%.\nIn the broader market, Toyota Industries 6201.T surged 5.9% after Toyota Motor 7203.T agreed to raise its offer to take the forklift maker private.\nSaizeriya 7581.T jumped 5.8%, touching an all-time high after the Italian restaurant chain reported record profit for the September to November quarter.\n\"News Services\" POPULAR ARTICLE\n-\nJapan\u2019s Princess Kako Marks 31st Birthday, Contributed to Key Events This Year\n-\nArctic Sees Unprecedented Heat as Climate Impacts Cascade\n-\nBrigitte Bardot, 1960s Sultry sex Symbol Turned Militant Animal Rights Activist Dies at 91\n-\nAt Least 7 Explosions and Low-Flying Aircraft Are Heard in Venezuela\u2019s Caracas\n-\nConvenience Store Chain Lawson May Start OTC Drug Delivery in 2026\nJN ACCESS RANKING\n-\nBOJ Gov.
