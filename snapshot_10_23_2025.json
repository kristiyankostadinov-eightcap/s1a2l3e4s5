                "body": "Gold's price is plunging. Here's why (and what investors should do next).\nGold has had an extraordinary run over the past year. The precious metal has climbed steadily in price since the start of 2025 and recently surpassed both expert and analyst expectations when the price closed in on $4,380 per ounce \u2014 marking an uptick of over 60% in less than 10 months. That particular gold price rally was driven by familiar forces: inflation concerns, geopolitical uncertainty and robust buying from central banks worldwide.\nThis week, though, the price momentum took a sharp turn in the opposite direction. On October 21, gold experienced its steepest single-day decline in over 12 years, falling by over 6% and losing close to $300 per ounce. Silver followed suit with an even larger drop of roughly 9%. The abrupt sell-off caught many investors off guard, especially after witnessing gold's epic ascent. And, gold has continued to fall further in the days since, with the price of gold currently sitting at just over $4,000 per ounce.\nAs a result, questions are emerging about what exactly is impacting the landscape and how to best handle this sudden downturn. Below, we'll examine the cause behind this dip in the price of gold and what moves investors should make next.\nFind out how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.\nHere's why the price of gold is plunging\nRight now, several key factors are converging to help explain why gold's price is under pressure, including:\nProfit-taking after a massive run\nGold prices surged this year as investors clamoured for refuge due to widespread economic uncertainty. But when an asset runs hard, the risk of profit-taking rises, and that is exactly what seems to be happening. Analysts point to the recent sharp drop as partly a reaction to gold investors cashing out their gains. And, once profits start to be locked in, momentum can reverse quickly in an asset like gold.\nLearn more about the benefits of gold investing now.\nA stronger U.S. dollar and rising real yields\nBecause gold is priced in dollars, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, it tends to make gold more expensive for non-U.S. investors, and, in turn, there's less demand. That's precisely what happened here. The dollar went up on the day of the decline, and as a result, gold became more expensive for international buyers, which naturally dampened the demand. Currency movements like these consistently influence the precious metal's appeal to global investors.\nEasing geopolitical and economic fears\nGold tends to thrive when the world looks unstable due to issues like war, trade concerns, inflation and uncertain policy. But if some of those fears fade, the demand for gold as a hedge can shrink. There are signs of that happening right now, like easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which is likely having an impact on the price of gold. Markets are also showing signs of greater risk tolerance, and when risk appetite returns, assets like stocks benefit, but gold tends to suffer. In combination, these factors help to explain the dramatic pull-back we've seen.\nHere's what investors should do next\nThe current gold price environment isn't necessarily a crisis. It's more of a turning point. For investors, that means thinking about strategy. Here's what gold investors may want to do next:\nConsider adding or adjusting, not abandoning, gold. If you believe in gold's long-term role as a hedge (against inflation, debt, systemic risks, etc.), then this pull-back can be an opportunity. Lower prices can allow you to layer in positions with dollar-cost averaging rather than chasing peaks. Now may be a better entry point than when prices were near record highs.\nLook at physical gold and diversification. Holding physical bullion can give you another dimension of exposure. But don't over-allocate. Gold should be part of a diversified portfolio, not the whole thing. Also consider other instruments (gold ETFs or gold mining stocks) if storage or logistics are a"

                "body": "China's Gold Binge May Eclipse US Dollar, Says Top Economist\nNamrata Sen\n5 min read\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nChina has emerged as a major force behind the recent surge in gold prices, with its growing influence projected to surpass even that of the U.S. dollar, according to a top economist.\nChina Buys Up Gold\n\u201cChina is playing a key role in the ongoing rise in gold prices because of central bank buying, arbitrage trading, and increased speculative and safe-haven demand among Chinese households,\u201d Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on his blog The Daily Spark.\nSlok suggested that in the face of global macroeconomic uncertainty, it is likely that central banks worldwide will soon hold more gold than U.S. dollars, the current global reserve currency.\nHis comments echo similar observations about China\u2019s increasing influence in the gold market.\nLast week, Steve Schoffstall, Director, ETF Product Management at Sprott Asset Management, told Benzinga: \u201cCountries view gold as a way to get around economic sanctions.\u201d\nVenture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya previously noted that China\u2019s relentless gold buying reflects a significant shift in global sentiment, with both governments and individuals seeking to hedge against mounting geopolitical and economic risks.\nIn July, it was reported that China\u2019s central bank has been quietly amassing gold reserves since 2022, a move that could have significant implications for the global economy, particularly the U.S. dollar.\nThe recent surge in gold prices past $4,000 per ounce has been highly beneficial for gold miners, with spot prices up nearly 50% year-to-date. Market veteran Ed Yardeni has raised his outlook significantly and stated that gold prices could hit $5,000 by 2026 and $10,000 by 2030.\nHowever, this trend took a sharp turn on Tuesday, with gold miners experiencing a significant sell-off following a plunge of over 5% in bullion prices in a single session. The spot price is still above $4,100 per ounce.\nVanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) plunged 9.42%, while shares of Newmont Corp. (NYSE: NEM), the world\u2019s largest gold miner, also fell 9.03%, as per data from Benzinga Pro.\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\nVinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine \u2014 a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades. With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows.\nWorthy Bonds\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\nMoomoo isn't just for trading \u2014 it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score u"

                "body": "Gold declines on profit-taking, renewed US Dollar demand\n- Gold price attracts some sellers in Thursday\u2019s early European session.\n- Optimism over easing trade tensions between the US and China prompted traders to lock in profits.\n- The ongoing US government shutdown and geopolitical risks could boost the safe-haven flows and help limit Gold's losses.\nGold price (XAU/USD) edges lower below $4,100 during the early European trading hours on Thursday. The precious metal has faced a sharp sell-off in the previous sessions on easing tensions between the United States (US) and China and the renewed US Dollar (USD) demand. Traders also book profits ahead of key US inflation data due on Friday. Furthermore, analysts believe that the end of the Diwali festival in India, the world\u2019s second-largest gold consumer, might reduce physical demand and drag the price lower.\nOn the other hand, the ongoing US government shutdown and geopolitical tensions could boost the Gold price, as it is viewed as a safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty. The speculation about further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) could underpin the yellow metal. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal.\nTraders will closely monitor the developments surrounding the US-China trade talks, as their trade representatives are scheduled to meet late this week ahead of a planned meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump next week.\nThe release of the US September Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be in the spotlight later on Friday due to the government shutdown-driven data drought. If the report shows a hotter-than-expected outcome, this could lift the USD and weigh on the USD-denominated commodity price in the near term.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Gold extends the decline as traders continue to book profits\n- The US President Donald Trump administration is considering a plan to curb an array of software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, to retaliate against Beijing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions, Reuters reported late Wednesday.\n- Gold experienced historic gains in 2025, with more than a 50% rise, surpassing previous volatile periods such as after the September 11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, or even the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- The US government shutdown has entered its fourth week with no resolution in sight. The Senate is expected to vote again on a funding bill, though it's likely to fail. This marks the second-longest government shutdown in US history.\n- Trump said late Wednesday that a long meeting is scheduled with China's Xi Jinping in South Korea, and thinks something will work out.\n- \"The sell-off appears to be largely technical, with profit-taking following an extended period of overbought conditions since September. Despite the pullback, bullion remains up roughly 55% this year, and the longer-term primary uptrend remains firmly intact,\u201d said Russell Shor, senior market analyst at tradu.com.\n- Fed funds futures imply a 97% chance of a 25 bps rate reduction, according to LSEG data.\nGold keeps the bullish vibe in the longer term above the key EMA\nGold price trades in negative territory on the day. According to the daily chart, the constructive outlook of the precious metal prevails, with the price being well-supported above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average. The upward momentum is reinforced by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which stands above the midline near 57.25.\nThe immediate resistance level to watch is $4,140, the high of October 15. If buyers step in, Gold could invite fresh bullish momentum toward $4,330, the high of October 16. The next hurdle is seen at the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band of $4,365.\nOn the downside, the crucial support level for XAU/USD is seen at the 4,000 psychological level.

                "body": "EUR/USD Forecast: Dollar recovery looks overdone ahead of CPI and FOMC\nThe EUR/USD was testing the 1.160 support area at the time of writing and bouncing back from its earlier lows. The lack of follow-through on the dollar side is keeping the pair from breaking lower. With US CPI on tap on Friday and FOMC next week, all while the US government shutdown continues, you can understand why there is lack of appetite to sharply bid up the dollar despite the crude oil recovery and weaker inflation data from the UK. Markets remain cautious, though, as geopolitical headlines from Europe continue to send mixed signals. The Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest has been called off, while reports suggest European nations are working on a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine. Still, traders are treating these developments with scepticism. Meanwhile, policymakers at the ECB remain committed to their neutral stance on rates and inflation guidance, meaning the EUR/USD forecast leans slightly bullish.\nBefore discussing the macro factors further, let\u2019s first turn our gaze to technicals and highlight some levels on the daily chart of the EUR/USD.\nEUR/USD technical analysis and levels to watch\nLooking at the chart of the EUR/USD and you can\u2019t help but feel it is as neutral as it can be. The length side-ways action over the past several months has totally ended the prior bullish momentum, yet the lack of a more meaningful breakdown so far suggests it is not a sellers\u2019 market either. This means trading the EUR/USD from one level to another is the way to go until a new trend established. On balance, though, the underlying long-term trend remains bullish, which is highlighted by the fact that the higher highs and higher lows have not been broken yet while price still holds above the 200-day moving average. Key support is the green shaded region starting at just below the 1.16 handle and extending to just below 1.15. Short-term res comes in around 1.1650; break this and resistance trend of channel will be in focus next around 1.1700. Bullish above it.\nDollar momentum fades without fresh data\nOn the dollar side, sentiment appears to be cooling. The US government shutdown, now the second longest in history, has delayed key data releases, leaving markets flying somewhat blind. Without fresh labour market figures, investors find little reason to scale back expectations of two Fed rate cuts by year-end and possibly three by March.\nIn this environment, it\u2019s difficult to be outright bullish on the dollar. Any escalation in US-China trade tensions could add further downside pressure. The longer this issue lingers, the greater the risk of a dollar pullback \u2013 which could help the EUR/USD recover modestly in the near term.\nCPI and FOMC to set the tone for EUR/USD forecast\nWhile the eurozone\u2019s sluggish data continues to hold back the euro, the downside has been cushioned by a softer dollar tone. This puts Friday\u2019s release of the Eurozone PMIs into sharp focus. The next major catalyst for EUR/USD forecast will likely come from the US side, however, with Friday\u2019s delayed CPI print likely to inject some volatility. Next week\u2019s FOMC meeting will be the real test. If policymakers confirm another rate cut, it could signal that the Fed is leaning more dovish, further limiting the dollar\u2019s upside. In that case, the 1.160 support on EUR/USD could hold firm, setting the stage for a possible rebound towards 1.180 in the short term.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

                "body": "The Euro has declined to weekly lows, trading below 1.1600, as earlier recovery attempts faltered. Traders await US CPI data and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision next week, keeping an eye on speeches from the European Central Bank and Fed officials.\nThe Euro has dipped to one-week lows, trading at 1.1586. The US Dollar resumed its upward trend as the market remains cautious, anticipating central bank addresses later.\nPolitical Stagnation Impact\nIn the US, political stagnation continues as President Trump postponed meetings with Democratic lawmakers, amidst a four-week government shutdown. Senate attempts to pass a funding resolution have failed 11 times, raising concerns over potential impacts on US GDP and Dollar credibility.\nThe Euro has shown mixed performance against other major currencies, gaining on the British Pound. The US Dollar faces restraints as trade hostilities with China cool, with a potential Fed rate cut anticipated later this month.\nEUR/USD remains on a downward path, with prospects of testing levels around 1.1545 and further down to 1.1460. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with resistance potentially encountered at 1.1650 and beyond.\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s key role is maintaining inflation near 2%. Their policy tools include interest rate adjustments and Quantitative Easing, traditionally weakening the Euro. During the pandemic, QE was a response to low inflation, with Quantitative Tightening providing a stronger currency rebound.\nHistorical Market Dynamics\nWe are seeing a familiar pattern in the EUR/USD, reminiscent of the market dynamics from early 2019. Back then, a protracted US government shutdown and expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot weighed on the dollar, even as the pair struggled below 1.1600. This historical parallel is important as we navigate the current market landscape.\nToday, political friction in Washington is once again a key factor, with contentious debt ceiling negotiations expected before the end of the year. We only need to look back at the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated shaved 0.2% off first-quarter GDP, to understand how this can restrain the dollar. This risk is keeping bullish sentiment on the US dollar in check for now.\nJust as traders back then were anticipating Fed easing, the market is now pricing in the first rate cuts for the second quarter of 2026. With the latest US CPI data released last week showing headline inflation has cooled to an annualized 2.5%, Fed funds futures now imply over a 70% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by May 2026. This reinforces the view that the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle is firmly in the past.\nThe European Central Bank, however, appears to be on a slightly different path. Eurozone inflation remains stickier, with the latest figures holding at 2.8%, and several ECB officials have recently pushed back against premature talk of rate cuts. This policy divergence is providing underlying support for the Euro and limiting the downside for the EUR/USD pair.\nGiven this backdrop, we believe buying short-dated EUR/USD call options is a reasonable strategy to position for a potential move higher. A strike price around 1.1050 would provide exposure to a breakout above recent resistance, especially if upcoming US labor market data shows any signs of softening. This approach allows traders to capitalize on potential upside while clearly defining risk."

The US Dollar (USD) resumed its uptrend in the early European trading session, with markets in a cautious mood ahead of the speeches of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials due later on the day.\nthe\nOn Tuesday, US President Donald Trump rebuffed meeting requests by Democratic lawmakers from the previous day, saying that he will not meet them until the government reopens. Meanwhile, the shutdown enters its fourth week as the Senate failed to pass a funding resolution for the 11th time on Monday.\nIn the absence of key macroeconomic releases in the Eurozone and the US, the speeches of European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, including President Christine Lagarde and Vice President Luis de Guindos, and Fed officials will be the unique distraction for traders. These speeches, however, are unlikely to provide any new clues on the central banks' near-term monetary policies.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Fed monetary easing hopes to limit US Dollar rallies\n- The US Dollar lost momentum as the latest episode of the Sino-US trade war went into the back burner, and investors shifted their focus once again to the protracted US government shutdown and the prospects of a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n- A survey by Reuters showed on Tuesday that most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at the October 28-29 meeting and a further quarter-point in December. 25 of 33 economists show concerns that the central bank might go too far with monetary easing and set a very low terminal rate by the end of next year.\n- US President Trump affirmed on Tuesday that Republicans \"will not be extorted\" by Democrats to bend to their demands, which suggests that this government closure is likely to be one of the largest in history. Such an extended closure will likely take a toll on US GDP growth and undermine investors' confidence in the US Dollar.\n- Earlier this week, Trump announced that he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea next week and that he expects to reach a fair deal. These comments have ditched fears of a US-China trade war, at least for now, and triggered a sharp sell-off in precious metals.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD extends losses below the 1.1600 support area\nEUR/USD's upside attempts have been short-lived, and the pair resumed its decline on Wednesday's European session, breaching the 1.1600 support area. The pair remains on a bearish trend following the rejection at 1.1730 last week. Technical indicators are in negative territory. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index is close but not yer ar oversold levels, and the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) remains well below the signal line.\nWith this in mind, the possibility of a retest of the October 9 and 14 lows in the area of 1.1545 remains on the table. Further down, the channel bottom, now around 1.1460, emerges as the next potential target. To the upside, the pair would need an unl"

This could be down to the fact that traders added to BoE easing bets, seeing 17bps of cuts by December.\nThe inflation print has brought a December rate cut into play once more as the print comes after wage growth also showed signs of a slowdown last week. However, the BoE decision in December may now rest with the outcome of the UK Autumn budget due in November.\nUK Inflation Data Opens Door to December Rate Cut\nThe most significant takeaway from the latest UK inflation data is the big drop in food inflation.\nOfficials and the Bank of England (BoE) had grown increasingly concerned throughout the year about rising food prices partly driven by April's tax and minimum wage hikes, fearing that this could fuel consumer expectations and turn the current spike into a more persistent inflation problem. Fortunately, food prices actually dropped in September, pulling the annual rate below 5% and running significantly below the BoE's August forecasts.\nSource: ING\nA similar easing was seen in services inflation, which also dipped below projections, with various measures of \"core services,\" including the closely-watched restaurants and caf\u00e9s sector, showing a decline.\nThis is particularly reassuring because the BoE had worried that pressure from food inflation could eventually emerge as a slower-moving, more lasting problem in the catering sector, but its annual price rate also thankfully eased in September.\nI initially predicted an interest rate cut in November, but because the Bank of England (BoE) has been cautious lately, I was forced to reevaluate my position. The market is now much more optimistic about a December cut, pricing a 72% chance of it happening.\nA December cut is certainly possible, but it will depend on the specifics of the late-November Autumn Budget. Specifically, the Bank will need to see proof that the government plans to significantly tighten spending in 2026, mainly through tax increases, and that these new taxes won't accidentally cause inflation to rise again next year, as some tax hikes did recently.\nUS Dollar Resurgence and US CPI Ahead\nThe US dollar has been on a decent run this week with the Dollar index on course for a retest of the October 9 highs around the 99.57 handle.\nThis has also contributed to the recent fall in GBP/USD.\nThe question now as markets await the highly anticipated US Inflation print due on Friday is whether this is just repositioning ahead of the CPI release.\nThis could be the Dollar rising ahead of the CPI release before falling once the data is out. A very intriguing time for the US Dollar and one which could have wider implications for many currency pairs and asset classes.\nFriday also brings a host of data from the UK. We have retail sales numbers and S&P PMI data scheduled for release which could impact GBP/USD.\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.

The pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) draws support due to increased risk aversion as traders are expected to approach the United States (US) inflation data due on Friday cautiously amid the ongoing government shutdown and resulting data blackout.\nThe Greenback also gains ground amid optimism surrounding the United States (US)-China trade deal. US President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that he expects to strike several agreements with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea next week. The Trump-Xi talks are set to address various issues, including U.S. soybean exports, nuclear arms limits, and China\u2019s Russian Oil purchases.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 96% possibility of another reduction in December. A Reuters poll suggested that 115 out of 117 economists have predicted that the Fed will reduce interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00% in the monetary policy announcement on October 29. For the year, 83 of 117 economists expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice, while 32 anticipate one cut.\nAdditionally, the GBP/USD pair depreciates as the Pound Sterling (GBP) faces intense selling pressure after the release of the United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September on Wednesday.\nThe UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.8% year-over-year (YoY) in September, against the market expectations of a 4.0% increase in the reported period. The reading was well above the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) 2% inflation target. Meanwhile, the core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 3.5% YoY, compared to August\u2019s 3.6% print, while missing the forecast of 3.7%.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates"

                "body": "GBP/USD remained stable during Wednesday\u2019s North American session despite a UK inflation report that weakened the Pound Sterling. The pair steadied at 1.3362 after initially dropping to 1.3305 following the release of CPI data. The UK Consumer Price Index for September stayed unchanged from August at 3.8% YoY, missing the 4% increase forecast. Core CPI fell to 3.5% YoY, down from 3.6%, below the expected 3.7% rise.\nMarket Expectations and Technical Analysis\nServices inflation held at 4.7%, under the anticipated 4.9%, affecting expectations for possible Bank of England rate cuts. Markets are now anticipating a 19 basis points cut during the BoE\u2019s December meeting, up from the previous expectation of 11 basis points. In the US, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting is expected to result in a 25 basis point rate cut, depending on the CPI report scheduled for Friday.\nTechnically, GBP/USD has a neutral to slightly negative bias. A close above the 20-day SMA at 1.3399 could lead to testing of the 50-day SMA at 1.3465. A fall below 1.3300 could push it towards the October low of 1.3248. GBP/USD experienced a 2% decline from mid-September highs, and recent data has reinforced this trend, with the British Pound performing strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nGiven the UK inflation data undershooting expectations, we see a clear signal for derivative traders. The increased probability of a Bank of England rate cut in December suggests initiating bearish positions on the Pound Sterling. This can be done by buying GBP/USD put options or selling futures contracts, targeting levels below the current support.\nThe 3.8% inflation figure, while still elevated, represents a significant cooling from the multi-decade highs we saw back in 2022 and 2023, which peaked over 11%. This historical context makes the current miss more impactful for the Bank of England\u2019s decision-making process. The steady, yet lower-than-forecast, services inflation of 4.7% reinforces the view that the disinflationary trend is taking hold, giving the BoE more room to ease policy.\nStrategy and Outlook\nOn the other side of the pair, the US Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates next week, but this has been largely priced in by the market. The sustained investment in AI, a trend we\u2019ve seen since the boom in 2023 and 2024, points to continued productivity gains and underlying strength in the US corporate sector. This creates a policy divergence where the surprise factor now lies with a more dovish Bank of England, making the US Dollar relatively more attractive.\nFor the coming weeks, a practical strategy would be to buy GBP/USD put options with a strike price around 1.3300, expiring after the December BoE meeting. This allows us to capitalize on the expected downward move while capping our maximum loss. If the pair breaks below the recent low of 1.3248, the 200-day moving average at 1.3212 becomes the next logical target.\nVolatility is likely to increase with the US CPI report on Friday and the Fed meeting next week. Traders could consider using option spreads, such as a bear put spread, to lower the cost of entry and define risk. This involves buying a higher-strike put and selling a lower-strike put simultaneously.\nLooking at the technical picture, any rally in GBP/USD toward the 20-day Simple Moving Average at 1.3399 should be viewed as a selling opportunity. The pair has already declined roughly 2% from its mid-September high of 1.3726. This new data reinforces the bearish momentum and suggests the path of least resistance is lower."

Any shift in China\u2019s economic conditions could also affect the Australian dollar (AUD), given the close trade ties between China and Australia.\nThe AUD/USD pair faces challenges amid growing bets of a near-term rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Australia\u2019s latest employment report threw an unexpected curveball, with the jobless rate climbing to its highest level in nearly four years this September. The surprise spike jolted markets into upping the odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut to 70%, a sharp jump from roughly 40% just a week prior. Now, traders are on high alert, scouring the horizon for economic clues, from this week\u2019s flash PMI readings to next week\u2019s all-important Q3 CPI figures, in hopes of divining the central bank\u2019s next move.\nThe AUD also draws support from improved market sentiment amid progress on a United States (US)-Australia trade agreement. President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a USD 8.5 billion critical minerals agreement at the White House on Monday, aimed at securing access to Australia\u2019s abundant rare-earth resources amid China\u2019s tighter export controls. Both nations also committed to investing at least USD 1 billion each over the next six months in mining and processing projects.\nUS Dollar gains as Trump expects agreements with China\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar (USD) against six major currencies, is gaining ground and trading around 99.00 at the time of writing. The Greenback received support from President Trump's comments late Wednesday that he expects to strike several agreements with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea next week. The Trump-Xi discussions are expected to cover a wide range of issues, including US soybean exports, limiting nuclear weapons, and China\u2019s purchases of Russian Oil.\n- The US Dollar may struggle as the prolonged US government shutdown delays the key US economic data releases, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), adding uncertainty for financial markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n- The US government shutdown has entered its fourth week as the Senate on Monday failed for the 11th time to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines. This marks the third-longest funding lapse in modern history.\n- A Reuters poll suggested that 115 out of 117 economists have predicted that the Fed will reduce interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00% in the monetary policy announcement on October 29. For the year, 83 of 117 economists expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice, while 32 anticipate one cut.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 96% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) decided on Monday to keep its one- and five-year Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) unchanged at 3.00% and 3.50%, respectively.\n- China\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 4.8% year-over-year (YoY) in the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, as expected following a 5.2% growth in the second quarter.

                "body": "China\u2019s Commerce Ministry recently announced plans to address development concerns and ensure global supply chain stability. The current value of AUD/USD is down by 0.05% at 0.6490, illustrating the impact of global economic signals.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) is heavily influenced by the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) interest rates, which are crucial in managing national inflation. As Australia\u2019s major export is iron ore, its price significantly impacts the AUD, especially given China\u2019s role as a primary export destination. Market sentiment also plays a role, affecting whether the AUD rises or falls based on global risk appraisal.\nThe Role Of The Reserve Bank Of Australia\nRBA\u2019s control over interest rates affects the economy broadly, with a target inflation rate of 2-3%. Higher rates, compared to other central banks, support the AUD, while quantitative measures can either increase or decrease its strength. China\u2019s economic health directly impacts AUD demand, with fluctuations in Chinese growth data shaping Australia\u2019s export dynamics.\nIron ore exports, valued at $118 billion in 2021, are critical, as price shifts alter Australia\u2019s Trade Balance. A positive Trade Balance strengthens the AUD. This balance, driven by export-import disparities, ultimately influences the currency\u2019s value as global trade conditions shift.\nChina\u2019s recent statements are a response to growing concerns over its economic momentum. We\u2019ve seen this reflected in the latest official NBS Manufacturing PMI, which dipped to 49.8 for September 2025, signaling a slight contraction. This weaker outlook directly impacts demand for Australian resources.\nThis softness in China has weighed on iron ore prices, a critical driver for the Australian dollar. After trading robustly above $130 per tonne for periods back in early 2024, prices are now hovering around $108, creating a headwind for the AUD. The lower commodity revenue directly affects Australia\u2019s trade balance, which we\u2019ve seen narrow over the last quarter.\nPotential Shift In RBA Stance\nDomestically, the Reserve Bank of Australia appears to be shifting its stance. With the latest Q3 2025 inflation data coming in cooler than expected at 3.2%, market chatter has grown louder about potential interest rate cuts in the first half of 2026. This contrasts with the situation two years ago, in 2023, when the central bank was aggressively hiking rates.\nGiven these factors, we see traders positioning for potential further weakness in the AUD/USD pair, which is currently near 0.6490. One approach is to purchase put options to profit from a decline in the currency\u2019s value. December 2025 puts with a strike price around 0.6350 could offer a way to capitalize on this bearish sentiment.\nHowever, the Chinese government\u2019s pledge to \u201csafeguard global supply chain stability\u201d introduces uncertainty. Any significant stimulus announcement could cause a sharp reversal, catching bearish positions off guard. Therefore, using defined-risk strategies like bear put spreads, which limit potential losses if the AUD unexpectedly rallies, should be considered."

The data arrives just days before the Bank of Japan's crucial October 29-30 policy meeting, where officials will decide whether to raise interest rates.\nFor traders watching USD/JPY, which currently sits near 152.40, the announcement could trigger significant moves depending on whether inflation meets, beats, or misses expectations.\nThe Statistics Bureau publishes the Consumer Price Index at precisely 8:30 AM local time on Thursday. The headline figure excludes fresh food prices but includes energy costs, giving policymakers and traders a clearer picture of underlying price pressures.\nSeptember's expected 2.9% reading would reverse three consecutive months of deceleration. August's figure came in at 2.7%, down from 3.1% in July.\nDespite the recent slowdown, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. [1]\nAnalysts at SMBC Nikko Securities point out that September's comparison looks somewhat distorted. Last year, during the same month, energy prices fell sharply after the government introduced utility and gas subsidies.\nThis base effect makes the year-on-year comparison appear stronger than the actual momentum in price increases.\nFood costs continue driving much of the inflation story. These sustained increases reflect companies passing higher raw material and labour costs onto consumers.\nCore-core inflation, which strips out both fresh food and energy, stood at 3.3% in August, showing persistent underlying price pressures.\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that officials will examine additional data before making their rate decision at the upcoming meeting.\nThe central bank currently holds its benchmark short-term rate at 0.5%, the highest level since 2008.\nMarket participants widely expect another 25 basis point increase at the October gathering. A Reuters poll of economists shows 56% expect a rate hike by year-end, with October being the most likely timing.\nTwo board members already dissented at the September meeting, voting for an immediate hike. Those internal divisions suggest growing impatience with the current policy stance.\nThe bank will release updated quarterly forecasts for growth and prices during the October session. These projections typically carry significant weight in shaping rate decisions.\nOfficials have indicated they want wage growth to broaden price pressures beyond goods and into services. [2]\nTokyo's September inflation figures, released earlier as a leading indicator, came in at 2.5% for the core measure. That matched August's pace but fell short of the 2.8% forecast.\nThe miss raised questions about whether nationwide data would similarly disappoint.\nThe dollar-yen pair traded at 152.38 on October 23, gaining 0.25% from the previous session. Over the past month alone, the yen has weakened 2.46% against the greenback.\nThe pair now approaches levels that historically trigger verbal intervention from Japanese officials.\nSeveral factors have pressured the yen lower in recent weeks. The interest rate gap between Japan and the United States remains wide, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive.\nPolitical uncertainty following recent elections has also weighed on the currency. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's administration is preparing a large economic stimulus package to address inflation concerns, which traders interpret as potentially delaying BOJ tightening.\nTomorrow's data release presents three distinct outcomes, each with different implications for currency positioning.\nIf core CPI meets the 2.9% forecast, USD/JPY will likely consolidate near current levels as markets digest the data and await BOJ guidance.

The pair appreciates as the Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens amid rising likelihood of the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi pursuing expansionary fiscal policies and supporting accommodative monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is widely expected to hold rates steady next week, with markets now eyeing a possible hike in January.\nTraders expected Prime Minister Takaichi to introduce a large-scale stimulus package as early as next month. Reports indicated the plan could exceed last year\u2019s JPY 13.9 trillion initiative aimed at easing inflation pressures on households.\nThe USD/JPY pair also draws support on optimism surrounding the United States (US)-China trade deal. US President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that he expects to strike several agreements with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea next week. The Trump-Xi discussions are expected to cover a wide range of issues, including US soybean exports, limiting nuclear weapons, and China\u2019s purchases of Russian Oil.\nHowever, the upside of the pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) may again struggle due to the prolonged US government shutdown, which delays key US economic data releases, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), adding uncertainty for financial markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed). The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 96% possibility of another reduction in December.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar Faruqui is a Forex Analyst based in New Delhi, India.

There was initially a sharp drop in the yen (i.e. a rise in USD/JPY) after the October 6 selection but that tempered as she initially struggled to form a government followed by some generalized risk aversion.\nThe risk mood has since stabilized and Takaichi forged a government.

Governor Tiff Macklem has reiterated that growth and labour market trends remain weak, keeping the policy tone \u201cclearly lean dovish.\u201d\nScotiabank added that while a further cut is likely, it \u201cmight be the last in the Bank\u2019s cycle,\u201d a view that could allow the Loonie to remain relatively steady in the near term.\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts noted that USD/CAD has \u201cbeen consistently capped above 1.4050,\u201d with key support around 1.3990 and the 200-day moving average near 1.3963. A sustained move below those levels would strengthen the case for additional CAD gains.\nNear-Term USD/CAD Forecast: Loonie Steady Ahead of Retail Sales Data\nThe short-term outlook for USD/CAD appears neutral to slightly bearish, with technical resistance around 1.4080 and a soft bias while the pair holds below 1.40. The Canadian Dollar\u2019s resilience will be tested by Thursday\u2019s retail sales reports (13:30 UTC), including headline and ex-auto data for August and preliminary figures for September.\nConsensus forecasts point to a monthly gain of 1.0% for August, with ex-auto sales expected to rise 1.2%. A stronger print could reinforce the view that the economy remains stable enough for the BoC to slow or pause its easing cycle after October\u2019s meeting.\nFor now, steady oil prices and a softer US yield curve are helping cushion the CAD against a firmer Dollar backdrop, suggesting the pair may continue to drift between 1.3950 and 1.4050 ahead of the policy decision.\nBeyond retail data, traders will focus on next week\u2019s Bank of Canada policy decision, where a quarter-point rate cut remains widely anticipated. Market reaction will hinge on whether policymakers signal an end to the easing cycle \u2014 a development that could provide a modest lift to the CAD if paired with firmer domestic data.\nSouth of the border, broader Dollar direction will be influenced by upcoming US labour and housing figures. Stronger readings could keep the greenback underpinned, while signs of cooling may see USD/CAD drift back toward the 1.39 area as risk appetite improves."

Limited easing potential from the Bank of Canada and possible trade and budget developments may strengthen the Canadian Dollar.\nCanada\u2019s inflation in September surpassed expectations, with the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) reaching a seven-month high of 2.4% year-on-year, compared to 1.9% in August. Core CPI also accelerated to a 19-month high of 3.15%, exceeding the consensus prediction of 3.0%.\nInflation And Interest Rates\nWith underlying inflation risks still present, it seems unlikely the BOC will cut rates below its neutral range of 2.25% to 3.25%. The swaps curve in Canada indicates a 75% likelihood of a 25 basis point reduction to 2.25% at the next meeting in late October, with a minor chance of an additional cut in the first quarter of the next year.\nWith USD/CAD testing the 1.4000 support level, we see limited reasons for a significant bounce in the near term. The primary driver is Canada\u2019s surprisingly high September inflation report, which complicates the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BOC) ability to cut interest rates aggressively. This suggests that the path of least resistance for the pair is lower in the coming weeks.\nThe inflation numbers are notable, as the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) hit a 19-month high of 3.15%, reversing the cooling trend we saw over the summer of 2025. This persistent underlying price pressure puts the BOC in a difficult position ahead of its October 29th meeting. While markets still expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, the hot inflation data makes follow-up cuts in early 2026 much less probable.\nThis dynamic creates a \u201chawkish cut\u201d scenario, where the BOC may lower rates but signal a prolonged pause, which is ultimately supportive for the Canadian dollar. We saw a similar situation play out in late 2023 when stubborn inflation data forced the central bank to halt its easing considerations, leading to a sharp rally in the CAD. This historical precedent suggests traders should be wary of shorting the Canadian dollar right now.\nLooking Ahead To Trade And Budget Developments\nLooking ahead, two key events could add further strength to the CAD. Positive whispers surrounding a US-Canada trade agreement expected next week could remove a significant headwind for the Canadian economy. Additionally, the pro-growth federal budget scheduled for November 4 is widely expected to include measures that will support domestic demand.\nGiven this backdrop, we believe derivative traders should position for either a range-bound or lower USD/CAD. Buying put options with a strike below 1.4000 could be an effective way to play a breakdown of the current range. For those with a more neutral view, selling call spreads above the 1.4080 resistance level offers a strategy to profit if the pair fails to rally significantly from here."

The Canadian dollar has hovered near C$1.40 against the US dollar, hurt by gloomy business outlooks and the growing sense that looser monetary policy is imminent. The latest Business Outlook Survey painted a cautious scene: only about a third of firms now believe they\u2019ll dodge a recession, and most are pulling back on new hiring, investment, and production. Nearly two-thirds of households also expect a recession within a year. Companies are finding it tough to raise prices because demand is soft, profit margins are getting squeezed, and fewer believe inflation will stay stubbornly high. With Canadian tariffs on US goods ending, even more downward pressure on inflation could be in store.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Economic gloom weighs on the loonie.\nCanada\u2019s sluggish economic growth is putting pressure on the loonie, and the full impact of expected rate cuts hasn\u2019t yet filtered through financial markets.

The ending of reciprocal tariffs might cool local inflation further, but it\u2019s still a question mark when stronger business and consumer confidence will return. For other countries grappling with similar issues, Canada\u2019s next moves could offer a preview of what\u2019s to come.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "GBP/JPY tumbles to near 202.00 on slower-than-expected UK inflation growth\n- GBP/JPY slides swiftly to near 202.00 as soft UK inflation data batters the Pound Sterling.\n- UK\u2019s core CPI rose moderately by 3.5%, while the headline inflation grew steadily at 3.8% pace.\n- Japan\u2019s newly elected PM Sanae Takaichi is expected to push big budget reforms.\nThe GBP/JPY pair is down 0.5% to near 202.00 during the European trading session on Wednesday. The pair has faced intense selling pressure as the Pound Sterling (GBP) underperforms its peers, following the release of the surprisingly softer United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today. British Pound was the weakest against the Australian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the British Pound from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent GBP (base)/USD (quote).\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the core inflation, which excludes volatile items, rose at a moderate pace of 3.5% on an annualized basis, slower than estimates of 3.7% and the prior reading of 3.6%. In the same period, the headline CPI grew steadily by 3.8%, softer than expectations of 4.0%. On month, the headline inflation remained flat after growing 0.3% in August.\nSigns of growth in inflationary pressures peaking are expected to prompt traders to raise bets supporting more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) in the remaining year. In the September policy meeting, the BoE stated that price pressures would peak around 4% this month.\nThis week, investors will also focus on the UK Retail Sales data for September, which will be published on Friday. The Retail Sales data would also influence market expectations for the BoE\u2019s monetary policy outlook.\nMeanwhile, the outlook of the Japanese Yen (JPY) has become uncertain as Japan\u2019s newly elected Sanae Takaichi Prime Minister (PM) after its Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Innovation Party formed a coalition government is expected to follow economic policies drawn by former PM Shinzo Abe. Market experts believe that Takaichi will favor big spending plans to boost the economy.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment.

                "body": "T. Rowe Price, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe proposed fund, named the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF, aims to outperform the FTSE US Listed Cryptocurrency Index, which tracks the ten largest U.S.-listed cryptocurrencies by market capitalization that meet SEC listing standards.\nUnlike passive funds, the ETF can overweight or underweight assets relative to the Index and may invest in crypto not included in it, though all holdings must meet eligibility criteria, according to the SEC filing.\nThe filing comes as a semi-surprise to market observers. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described it as a \u201csemi-shock,\u201d noting that T. Rowe Price, a top-five active manager largely known for traditional mutual funds, is now entering the nascent but increasingly crowded crypto ETF space.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a land rush for this space,\u201d he tweeted.\nShares will trade on NYSE Arca. Investors can buy and sell shares like a stock, but it still carries the usual crypto risks.\nIn the past, Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T. Rowe Price\u2019s ETFs, has emphasized his belief and long-term conviction in crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoins.\n\u201cOver the long run, I think there are going to be plenty of applications that utilize these technologies,\u201d Rizzo said, in reference to crypto.\nCrypto and Bitcoin ETFs\nExchange-traded funds have become a popular way for traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto, without holding the assets directly. Bitcoin ETFs offer investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe first U.S. Bitcoin-linked ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), launched on October 19, 2021, tracking Bitcoin futures contracts. However, it wasn\u2019t until January 10, 2024, that the U.S. SEC approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing funds to directly hold Bitcoin\nThe largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management is the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock. IBIT holds over $100 billion in assets, representing over 3% of the total Bitcoin supply.\nOther notable spot Bitcoin ETFs include Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), each managing billions in assets.\nBitcoin whales are increasingly using ETFs and moving their holdings from cold storage into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, using tax-neutral \u201cin-kind\u201d transactions that convert Bitcoin into fund shares without selling.\nThis shift integrates Bitcoin into traditional finance, making it easier to borrow against, use as collateral, and include in estate planning, with firms like BlackRock already processing billions in such transfers."

See the trading setup here.\nMarjorie Taylor Greene's Latest Buys\nA new disclosure from Greene, which is tracked by the Benzinga\u2019s Government Trades page, reveals six stocks purchased in October along with one ETF.\nHere are the trades disclosed by the Greene, with several assets bought more than once:\n- Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE): $1,000 to $15,000 in shares bought on Oct. 15\n- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n- Amazon.com Inc: $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\n- Exelon Corp (NASDAQ:EXC): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n- iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n- iShares Bitcoin Trust: $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\n- Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n- United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\nOf the stocks bought, several come before quarterly earnings results with Tesla having reported on Oct. 22, UPS reporting on Oct. 28, Amazon reporting on Oct. 30 and Exelon reporting on Nov. 4.\nAll of the stocks and ETFs disclosed by Greene have previously been bought by her this year, including Adobe and the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which were disclosed as purchases by the congresswoman last month.\nAdobe and UPS are frequent purchases disclosed by Greene with the stocks bought in six and seven of the 10 months of 2025, respectively. Tesla stock has also been bought in five of the 10 months of the year now.\nGreene went several years without disclosing stock purchases before unveiling a handful in 2024 in May 2024. That disclosure has been followed up with trades every month or two, with each month in 2025 having at least one disclosure.\nDid You Know?\n- Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\nGreene's Trades Draw Increased Attention\nAs Benzinga previously reported, several of Greene\u2019s trades could be problematic given the timing and her committee assignments.\nThe congresswoman is one of several members of Congress who have bought Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. One of her purchases came shortly before President Donald Trump announced he would make a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Greene is an ally of the president, who has helped boost the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) with a pro-Bitcoin agenda since taking office in January.\nGreene's purchase of Palantir, while serving on the Committee on Homeland Security, drew increased scrutiny with the company having multiple government contracts.\nThe congresswoman has said that she has a portfolio manager who handles all of her trades. Greene brushed off criticism earlier this year over the timing of buying numerous stocks before Trump announced a pause on tariffs and sent stock prices significantly higher.\n\u201cI think that criticism is laughable. President Trump has been talking about tariffs for decades,\u201d Greene told reporters when asked about the trades at a recent town hall event in Georgia, in a clip shared by Unusual Whales.\nThe congresswoman used the opportunity to boast about her stock performance, which ranked her as one of the top trading members of Congress in 2024.\n\u201cI don\u2019t place my buys and sells,\" Greene said, citing an agreement she has with her portfolio manager, who handles all the buying and selling of stocks. \u201cHe did a great job. Guess what he did. He bought the dip. And that\u2019s what anybody that has financial sense does.\"\nGreene also said her portfolio manager did not have inside information; everything was public and a potential tariff pause wasn\u2019t a secret.\nSeveral Congress members have called for a ban on the buying and selling of stocks and options by members of Congress.

Inside Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 loyalty test\nBase and Arbitrum earn most profits; where does Polygon fit?\nThis week, the Ethereum ecosystem has been rocked by a $654 million ETH transfer by the Ethereum Foundation. This triggered intense scrutiny over developer compensation, transparency, and leadership, culminating in the public resignation of core developer P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi and renewed criticism of governance practices.\nSimultaneously, Polygon\u2019s AggLayer upgrade has faced launch delays and network instability, intensifying debate about Layer-2 alignment, fragmentation, and the Foundation\u2019s support for external L2s.\nThese developments, alongside POL token migration volatility, ongoing struggles to balance mainnet centralization with L2 sovereignty, and reaction to the Foundation\u2019s earlier executive restructuring, have added fresh urgency to the disputes over Ethereum\u2019s future direction and the sustainable growth of its scaling ecosystem.\nEthereum family feud\nEthereum\u2019s scaling architecture underwent a transformation from a technical sidebar to a political economy when Vitalik Buterin praised Coinbase\u2019s Base for \u201cdoing things the right way,\u201d weeks after Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal assumed the CEO role at the Polygon Foundation, issuing warnings about Ethereum\u2019s \u201cexistential\u201d layer-2 (L2) direction.\nThe question emerging from competing visions is whether Ethereum will standardize how L2s earn and settle value, or watch liquidity fragment into parallel systems that route around rather than through the mainnet.\nThe tension crystallized across three developments in mid-2025. Nailwal took leadership of Polygon Foundation on June 11 amid a strategy reset, positioning the network as more independent from Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric orthodoxy.\nPolygon shipped AggLayer v0.3 on June 23, advancing chain-agnostic interoperability with Polygon PoS, which was slated to connect by the end of the third quarter, but did not happen as of press time.\nButerin\u2019s public endorsement of Base in September reignited debates over whether Ethereum\u2019s leadership favors specific L2s, amplifying earlier friction when Nailwal questioned the low recognition from Ethereum core developers and warned that anti-L2 sentiment could fracture the ecosystem\u2019s social fabric.\nData from L2BEAT shows Arbitrum and Base command the largest shares of value secured on Ethereum layer-2s, with OP Mainnet and Linea trailing.\nThe Polygon zkEVM remains materially smaller than its Proof-of-Stake chain, both in terms of total value locked and transaction activity.\nDune sequencer profit dashboards reveal that Base and Arbitrum generate the majority of net sequencer earnings after subtracting layer-1 data costs, with Base consistently ranking as a top profit generator through late summer 2025.\nButerin\u2019s 2025 roadmap commentary centers on simplification, mainnet resilience, including privacy improvements, and a layer-2 user experience that relies more heavily on layer-1 security guarantees.\nThat guidance establishes what Ethereum leadership considers \u201cgood L2 citizenship\u201d: canonical fraud or validity proofs, reliance on Ethereum for data availability, and alignment with emerging standards for light clients and shared sequencing.\nPolygon\u2019s AggLayer pursues chain-agnostic shared liquidity, positioning the network adjacent to, rather than inside, Ethereum\u2019s rollup orthodoxy.\nIts Proof-of-Stake chain is migrating toward zkEVM validium integration, which utilizes alternative data availability layers.\nThree paths for fee capture and market structure\nThe next six to 12 months will test whether Ethereum can standardize value flows across competing layer-2 architectures.\nIn a soft-alignment scenario with a 50% to 60% probability, the Ethereum mainnet captures 25% to 40% of the layer-2 gross fee revenue as improvements in blob compression and data availability stabilize costs.\nBase and Arbitrum retain 60% to 70% of layer-2 net profits, with OP Stack proliferation sustainin"

                "body": "As Ethereum (ETH) hovers around $3,875 and Solana (SOL) trades near $186, investors are seeking new opportunities beyond established assets. Digitap ($TAP), a promising DeFi project, has emerged as a focal point for whale investors.\nWith its unique blend of cryptocurrency and traditional finance features, Digitap is attracting attention as a potential 100x gem in the DeFi space. Analysts suggest it could be the best altcoin to invest in this year if it sees continued momentum.\nWhy Solana and Ethereum Whales Are Eyeing Digitap\nEthereum\u2019s current price of $3,875 reflects a ~4% daily decline, while Solana\u2019s price of $186 shows a 2.6% daily drop. These downturns, along with even higher monthly declines, have prompted investors to explore alternative assets. The rationale is clear: while ETH and SOL remain fundamental, their growth potential is limited compared to innovative presale projects.\nDigitap\u2019s presale has already seen over 60M tokens sold, with the price climbing from $0.0194 to $0.0268 \u2014 a 40% jump to the next stage. Large holders are taking positions early, recognizing the combination of a live product, omni bank capabilities, and a growing user base. Unlike many presales that rely solely on roadmaps, Digitap allows users to spend, transfer, and manage funds directly from its app on the Apple and Google Play stores.\nFor whales, this lowers execution risk and offers a credible alternative to speculative holdings. The project\u2019s omni-bank model merges crypto and fiat, creating an ecosystem that drives actual financial activity rather than just hype. As these large investors accumulate, momentum builds, often signaling the start of a major run in early-stage tokens.\nReal-World Utility That Sets Digitap Apart\nDigitap isn\u2019t just another DeFi concept \u2014 it has a functioning platform. Users can onboard without KYC in eligible regions, open accounts, spend via a card, and move funds seamlessly between crypto and fiat. This ease of access positions Digitap to capture adoption from both crypto enthusiasts and the 1.4 billion unbanked worldwide.\nThe platform also integrates with traditional financial systems, providing a bridge for users who want exposure to crypto while still interacting with conventional banking. By doing so, Digitap taps into a broader market and demonstrates a tangible single account use case that many projects lack.\nThe market is also very relatable. Global citizens want access to KYC-free payments, without being charged exorbitant amounts. There is a huge demand for flexible, private finance, accessible from a unified financial superapp. Digitap provides this at a time when other projects merely speculate.\nThis focus on real-world utility has resonated with whales and retail investors alike. The combination of a working app, omni-bank functionality, and cross-border transaction capabilities signals a high utility environment to sustain long-term growth.\nTokenomics Driving Long-Term Demand\nDigitap\u2019s tokenomics are designed to create scarcity and reward committed users. Fifty percent of platform profits are allocated to burning $TAP and distributing staking rewards, generating deflationary pressure as adoption grows.\nThis structure ensures that each new user and transaction contributes to long-term value for holders. The staking program itself is attractive to both retail and institutional investors, offering competitive APRs that incentivize holding over short-term speculation. The limited supply of 2B tokens further enhances scarcity, making early entry positions particularly valuable.\nWhale accumulation has historically preceded significant token appreciation in early-stage projects. In Digitap\u2019s case, the mix of strong tokenomics, working utility, and early accumulation sets the stage for extraordinary returns. Market observers note that projects that begin with tangible real-world activity are better equipped to survive market volatility.\nMarket Outlook: Could Digitap Achieve 100X?\nThe price for $TAP is curr"

                "body": "In This Article\nWhen most people hear the word \"Ethereum,\" their minds often jump to cryptocurrency charts and market fluctuations. While its token, Ether (ETH), is certainly a significant digital asset, focusing solely on its monetary value misses the bigger picture. Ethereum is less like a digital dollar and more like a global, decentralized computer that is powering the next evolution of the internet which is commonly known as Web3.\nThe Power of Smart Contracts\nAt the heart of Ethereum\u2019s revolutionary potential are smart contracts. Think of a traditional contract, a paper document that relies on lawyers and courts for enforcement. A smart contract digitizes and automates this entire process. It's a piece of code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and automatically executes its terms when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract could be programmed to instantly release a digital artwork to a buyer the moment it receives payment. There's no need for an intermediary to broker the deal or a third party to verify the transaction; the code itself is the law and the enforcer. This automation of trust is the engine driving Web3, enabling complex agreements and applications to run securely and transparently without a central authority.\nFueling the DeFi Revolution\nThe most explosive use case for Ethereum's smart contract technology has been decentralized finance, or DeFi. This is an entire ecosystem of financial services built on the blockchain, offering an alternative to the traditional banking system. Through DeFi applications, you can lend, borrow, trade, and earn rewards on your digital assets without ever needing to go through a bank. It has created a global, accessible financial landscape that operates 24/7. By staking ETH, for example, users can not only receive rewards but also actively participate in securing the network itself.\nA Playground for Developers and Creators\nEthereum was designed from the ground up to be a platform for building. Its open-source nature and robust documentation have attracted a massive global community of developers. They use its flexible programming language, Solidity, to create decentralized applications (dapps) that span countless industries, from gaming and social media to supply chain management. This is the same technology that enabled the explosion of NFTs, giving creators a new way to monetize their work and prove ownership of digital items. The network acts as a huge, ever-growing, and immutable public ledger, ensuring that the rules of these applications, once set, cannot be tampered with.\nEvolving Through Constant Upgrades\nA common critique leveled against early blockchain technology was its scalability and energy consumption. The Ethereum community has met these challenges head-on with a roadmap of continuous improvement. Major upgrades are designed to make the network more scalable, secure, and sustainable. This commitment to evolution is critical. It shows that Ethereum is not a static piece of technology but a dynamic ecosystem that adapts to new demands and fixes its own shortcomings, ensuring its long-term viability as the backbone for Web3 innovation.\nMore Than Just a Digital Currency\nWhile headlines often fixate on the daily Ethereum price, its true value is reflected in the vibrant economy being built on its foundation with a market capitalization in the hundreds of billions and an all-time high of nearly $5,000.\nSuccess Built on Dependable Infrastructure\nEthereum\u2019s success comes from its ability to be a dependable and censorship-resistant platform for computation. It provides the core infrastructure, the digital bedrock, that allows thousands of other tokens, applications, and entire financial systems to exist and thrive. That, ultimately, is its most profound contribution."

In total, the firm holds 4.5% of the company shares, with another 4.5% of the stake owned directly by CEO Ken Griffin.\nCitadel is among the top holders of DeFi Dev Corp. The fund, through its CEO Ken Griffin, holds 4.5% of the outstanding DFDV shares. Additional ownership includes several Citadel subsidiaries. The ownership shows a DAT company is among the selections of one of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds.\nCitadel Advisors LLC, Citadel Advisors Holdings LP, and Citadel GP LLC hold 2.7% of shares outstanding. Citadel Securities LLC holds another 1.4%, Citadel Securities Group LP, and Citadel Securities GP LLC together own 1.8% of the shares outstanding.\nThe shares were announced in a recent report, showing additional exposure to crypto through the treasury company. The participation of Citadel shows support for DAT companies, even at a relatively late stage of the market. Griffin and Citadel may also be eligible for the upcoming round of warrants with a $22.50 exercise price.\nDeFi Dev Corp. expands SOL per share\nDeFi Dev Corp. expanded its SOL per share by 375% since the start of its buying.\nAs of October 22, DFDV holds 0.076 SOL per share, in the middle of the range for DAT companies. The leader is still Forward Industries with 3.9 SOL per share.\nCurrently, DeFi Dev Corp holds nearly 2.2M SOL, locked as a validator stake. Currently, DFDV shares trade at $14.14, trading in the middle of the range for the past year. DFDV maxed out at $34.25 during the peak of DAT companies.\nThe mNAV metric for DeFi Dev Corp. is exactly 1.0, bringing the value of owned SOL on par with the stock\u2019s market capitalization. For most DAT companies, mNAV metrics have fallen significantly, as the markets lost enthusiasm for the overpriced shares.\nSOL also took a step back to $183.71, despite the robust on-chain activity. SOL has lost some of its momentum as new ETF approvals were delayed by the US government shutdown.\nSolana treasuries expand above 20M SOL\nSolana treasuries already hold 20.31M SOL. Despite the slower acquisitions, treasuries are boosting Solana\u2019s ecosystem. Reserves rose by over 12% since October 15, as some treasury companies bought the dip. SOL acquisitions are not as methodical as those of BTC, but offer additional advantages for activities within the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\nAround 9M of that SOL is staked in various forms, creating more validators. The DAT companies have achieved an average passive yield of 7.7% from their staking activities.\nIf you're reading this, you\u2019re already ahead. Stay there with our newsletter."

He earned his undergraduate degree in Economics and is currently studying for a Master\u2019s in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies at the University of Malta.\nKey Notes\n- Griffin's investment through Citadel entities totals 1.3M shares in the Solana-focused treasury company.\n- DeFi Development Corp's SOL holdings show 67% unrealized gains since April 2025 acquisition.\n- Technical analysis indicates potential SOL breakout toward $260 if price sustains above $190 resistance.\nKenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, disclosed a 4.5% beneficial ownership stake in DeFi Development Corp, a Nasdaq-listed firm that adopted the Solana SOL $178.5 24h volatility: 6.0% Market cap: $97.75 B Vol. 24h: $7.56 B treasury reserve strategy in April 2025, according to a Schedule 13G filing with the SEC.\nThe filing revealed Griffin\u2019s indirect ownership through Citadel Advisors LLC and affiliated entities, totaling 1,315,654 shares, with another 4.5% stake owned directly by the fund through its subsidiaries.\nDeFi Development Corp\u2019s business model focuses on acquiring and staking Solana tokens, a strategy designed to combine long-term capital appreciation with consistent staking yield. By locking in newly purchased SOL, the company not only secures a passive income stream but also contributes to network security and validator activity within the Solana blockchain ecosystem.\nAccording to CoinGecko data, DeFi Development Corp currently holds 2,195,926 SOL, representing approximately 0.402% of Solana\u2019s circulating supply. The company acquired its Solana holdings at an estimated $236.5 million, which are now valued at approximately $395.3 million, reflecting a 67% unrealized gain.\nSolana price is trading at $179 at press time, up 370% since DeFi Corp began acquiring SOL in April 2025.\nSolana Price Analysis: Double Bottom Pattern Suggests Potential Breakout Toward $260\nSolana price hovered near $179 on Wednesday, forming a classic double-bottom reversal pattern on the 12-hour chart that signals a potential bullish rebound. The pattern, marked by two local lows at the $175 and $170 level, indicates strong support just below current price levels.\nA sustained close above the neckline resistance near $190.82 could confirm a bullish reversal, while a validation of the double bottom signal will require a 45% upside move from current levels.\nOther key indicators also support the optimistic Solana price forecast. The MACD histogram has narrowed, suggesting waning bearish momentum, while the RSI at 41.5 shows Solana nearing oversold territory, which could signal entry moves from traders looking to buy at a local bottom.\nIf Solana breaches $210 with strong volume, the double-bottom signal points to a potential rally above $250. However, failure to maintain support above $171.41 could invalidate the bullish formation, potentially sending prices back toward $160.\nSUBBD Presale Nears $1.5M as Solana Whale Demand Intensifies\nCitadel\u2019s indirect investment in Solana has sparked renewed investor interest in early-stage projects like SUBBD.\nSUBBD deployed advanced AI tools to bridge the gap between influencers, brands, and their global online communities.\nThe ongoing SUBBD presale has surged past $1.45 million of its $1.6 million target, with tokens currently priced at $0.058. With the next pricing tier approaching in less than 24 hours, early participants can visit the official SUBBD presale website to secure up to 20% staking rewards before the next round begins.\nDisclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

According to a post-mortem shared by the Solana team, the blockchain saw no decline in throughput and even outperformed other major networks during the disruption. This performance has reignited discussions around Solana\u2019s technical resilience and real-world scalability.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), a major infrastructure provider for much of the internet\u2014including parts of the crypto ecosystem\u2014experienced downtime that affected various platforms. Yet, Solana didn\u2019t flinch.\nNo Impact on Performance\nThe post-mortem report highlights that Solana\u2019s network maintained stable transaction throughput throughout the outage, despite some of its validators relying on AWS infrastructure. Thanks to a more decentralized validator set and recent infrastructure upgrades, the network remained operational and responsive during the entire incident.\nWhere other blockchains reported slower confirmation times or reduced availability, Solana continued to process thousands of transactions per second, unaffected by the AWS disruption. This came as a surprise to critics who have often questioned Solana\u2019s ability to stay stable under stress.\nA Boost for Solana\u2019s Reputation\nSolana\u2019s ability to handle such an outage with zero downtime is a strong argument for its growing maturity as a Layer 1 solution. As the blockchain industry moves toward mass adoption, network reliability and uptime become key selling points. Solana\u2019s performance during the AWS event could help restore confidence following past outages and congestion issues.\nFor developers and projects considering where to build next, this may be another reason to give Solana a second look.\nRead Also:\n- BlockDAG Takes the Lead with Speed, Precision, and a $430M Presale While BONK & BNB Battle Market Swings\n- Should You Get a Bitcoin-Backed Mortgage?\n- BlockDAG\u2019s $430M+ Presale & BWT Alpine F1\u00ae Team Partnership Outpace BONK\u2019s Struggles & BNB\u2019s Modest Recovery\n- Eric Trump: \u201cWe Love the Asset Known as Bitcoin\u201d\n- The Best Crypto Coins Right Now: BlockDAG\u2019s Binance AMA Steals the Spotlight as Monero, BNB, and Sui Compete for Market Momentum\nThe post Solana Unshaken by AWS Outage, Leads All Networks appeared first on CoinoMedia."

Shares came under pressure following a Reuters report that the White House was mulling curbs on exports to China made with U.S. software.\nGold futures, which had added to yesterday's losses of nearly 5.5%\u2014their worst day in a dozen years\u2014most of the session, rallied late and at 4 p.m. ET were 0.3% higher at $4,120.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences borrowing costs of products like mortgages, ticked lower to 3.95%. Bitcoin traded at $107,900, down from nearly $112,000 earlier Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures advanced almost 3% to $59.50 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was near flat at 98.93.\nIn corporate news, Netflix (NFLX) shares closed down 10% after the streaming giant reported weaker-than-expected quarterly profit. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, with shares up about 14% as the surgical robot manufacturer posted earnings that topped expectations and boosted its outlook as procedures using its da Vinci system grew.\nDraftKings (DKNG) stock rose more than 3% after the sports-betting company announced it was entering \"prediction markets\" by acquiring Railbird. Shares of Six Flags Entertainment (FUN) fell more than 4% after soaring 18% yesterday on news that NFL star Travis Kelce was teaming up with activist investor Jana Partners to push for change at the amusement parks operator.\nTesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) shares ended down less than 1% and up more than 2%, respectively, ahead of their third-quarter results after the close today. Meta Platforms (META) stock finished little changed following word the company was laying off 600 employees within its AI unit.\nAlso, AT&T (T) shares declined about 2% on weaker-than-expected revenue even though it reported strong fiber and postpaid phone net additions; and shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) ended 0.5% higher on a Bloomberg report that the firm's Google unit was in talks with Anthropic to provide cloud computing services in a deal \"valued in the high tens of billions of dollars.\"\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Wednesday\nDecliners\n- Shares of Lennox International (LII) slumped 10.2%. The provider of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration solutions fell short of quarterly sales expectations, reflecting declines in its residential segment. The company said a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a regulatory transition to new refrigerants weighed on its performance.\n- Netflix (NFLX) reported lower-than-expected net income for the third quarter. The results included a one-time tax expense of more than $600 million related to the video-streaming giant's business in Brazil. The country's Supreme Court determined earlier this year that a tax on cross-border payments could apply to a broader range of transactions, and Netflix took the charge given the likelihood that it could be subject to the ruling, CEO Spencer Neumann said. Netflix shares sank 10.1%.\n- Coinbase Global (COIN) shares fell 5.4%, following the prices of major cryptocurrencies lower. Bitcoin, which traded as high as $113,700 during the regular session yesterday, tumbled below $110,000 overnight and remained under $109,000 throughout Wednesday's session. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, slipped to about $3,800 today.\nAdvancers\n- Shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) surged 13.9%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after the maker of robotic surgical devices topped third-quarter sales and adjusted profit estimates.

Let\u2019s go old school this week by scanning key events with some of the best names on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). We\u2019ll also wag a finger at the DJIA\u2019s worst component as we head into the heart of the Q3 earnings season.\nDow Basics\nJust to level set, the Dow consists of 30 stocks, weighted by share price. It\u2019s a rudimentary way to track how the U.S. equity market performs, but you can\u2019t argue with tradition. The index has existed for more than 100 years, and when General Electric (now GE Aerospace) slipped the surly bonds of the DJIA in 2018, none of the original dozen Dow companies were left.\nNamed after Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index\u2019s current complexion remains more value-oriented than the growthy-heavy Nasdaq Composite or even the S&P 500. Just take a look at the sector breakdown via the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). The $40 billion product holds a plurality of Financials at a 26% weighting. Information Technology (more than 35% of the S&P 500\u00ae SPDR Trust ETF (SPY)) makes up just 20% of DIA. There are no Utilities holdings, as that has its own index\u2014the Dow Jones Utilities Average. Real Estate is also absent from the Dow.\nThe Top Performer: Caterpillar\nOK, class dismissed. Let\u2019s talk ideas and individual stocks.\nSo far in 2025, the Dow\u2019s top dog is CAT\u2014Caterpillar, that is. Shares are up 49%, dividends included, year to date. The $247 billion market cap Industrials-sector position has plowed higher, not from farming equipment demand, but thanks to its AI presence. CAT is a leader in turbine manufacturing, and it plays a vital role in the buildout of power generation for data center proliferation.\nDon\u2019t overlook its earnings date of Wednesday, October 29, BMO. Its report is surrounded on the calendar by some of the Nasdaq\u2019s heavyweights, such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). CAT\u2019s executive team\u2019s commentary around the AI boom and related electricity needs could move industries well beyond Construction Machinery & Heavy Transportation Equipment.\nJ&J\u2019s Healthy Year\nAs CAT purrs, there\u2019s a fight for the No. 2 YTD performance slot among the Dow 30. As of this writing, the tie goes narrowly to a company that may raise some eyebrows. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has returned nearly 38% in 2025. The pharma giant and household name issued strong profit numbers last week, all while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was talking cockroaches! Shares rallied sharply heading into the October 14 third-quarter release, and the bulls remained in charge despite rising S&P 500 volatility.\nJNJ is popular with income investors, given its forward dividend yield of 2.7%\u2014about twice that of the S&P 500. And with a guidance hike issued alongside the revenue and net income numbers, vital signs have looked good. The bears may point to a somewhat swollen price-to-earnings ratio just below 18x for this slow & steady Health Care stock.\nJNJ\u2019s corporate event calendar is light. Its management team has just a pair of speaking engagements on November 11: The UBS Global Healthcare Conference and the Guggenheim Global Healthcare Innovation Conference.\nNVIDIA Keeps Rolling\nThe third-best DJIA stock of the year is NVIDIA (NVDA). The world\u2019s most valuable public company has seen its equity return 37% and more than double from the April post-Liberation Day low below $90. The chip giant is always a late-season reporter, so we won\u2019t hear its Q3 2026 results until Wednesday, November 19, AMC.\nBut NVIDIA is among t"

                "body": "Markets react to UK CPI, as Barclays sets the bar for UK banks\n- Rate cut bets ramp up post CPI report.\n- Inflation peaks at lower level than expected.\n- UK bonds shine.\n- Barclays does the heavy lifting for the UK\u2019s financial sector.\n- Precious metals stabilize as miners lead the FTSE 100 higher once again.\n- Tesla results in focus.\n- Netflix shares sink after Brazilian tax issue.\nThe Pound has sunk on Wednesday after UK inflation was softer across the board. GBP is the worst performing currency in the G10 FX space on Wednesday and GBP/USD looks like it is heading back to the lows of the month at $1.3250. UK bond yields are tumbling, which are undermining the weakness in the pound.\nRate cut bets ramp up post CPI report\nThe softer inflation print is welcome news, however, as it has boosted the chances of an early Christmas present from the Bank of England. There are 17 bps of cuts priced in by the UK OIS market for December, compared to 10 bps of cuts expected on Tuesday. Traders are betting that the softer inflation print could drive the BOE to cut rates by year end, as this inflation print gives the BOE more leeway to loosen monetary policy earlier than anticipated. The next BOE meeting takes place in November, and it will be watched closely to see if there is a dovish shift at the bank indicati8ng whether or not a December rate cut is possible.\nInflation peaks at lower level than expected\nThe September inflation print is important since this was the month when the BOE expected inflation to peak at 4% before falling from there. Since the peak may be lower than expected at 3.8% for headline inflation, and 3.5% for core price growth, then it could be downhill from here.\nPrice resets tend to take place in April in the UK, and the final months of the year can see inflation pressures weaken. The BOE and the Chancellor will hope that this rings true. In August, the BOE expected inflation to peak at 4% and then to fall in 2026 and finally reach the 2% target rate in 2027. Although the BOE said that there were risks around this forecast, they also said that if spending fell faster than expected, this could dampen price pressure further. Thus, a weak outlook for the consumer combined with a lower inflation impulse could be the right conditions for a sooner than expected rate cut.\nUK bonds shine\nUK Gilts are the top performers globally this morning, the 2-year yield is lower by 9bps and the 10-year yield is down more than 7bps. In the past month, UK 2-year yields are lower by 21bps, and the 10-year yield is down by 31bps, outpacing losses for European and US yields.\nThe decline in yields is down to a confluence of factors including concerns about the growth outlook, today\u2019s lower CPI print, and hopes that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will build a larger fiscal headroom in her budget. While tax rises are not good for growth, a mix of tax increases and substantial spending cuts could keep yields subdued.\nOverall, UK stocks and bonds are stealing the show today, while the pound sinks. The FTSE 100 is bucking the trend across Europe where stocks are falling, the UK index is up by 0.5%, boosted by some strong earnings data.\nBarclays does the heavy lifting for the UK\u2019s financial sector\nBarclays is leading the UK\u2019s banking sector higher today and its share price is higher by more than 3% after it released earnings earlier. The bank said that it had little exposure to private credit, which is a bonus for nervy investors. The bank also reported solid investment banking and retail lending numbers, which is sweetening the mood for shareholders on Wednesday. The strong results is not having much of an effect on other UK lenders, and Barclays is doing the heavy lifting for the UK\u2019s financial sector today. This could be because of the ramping up of interest rate cut bets, which could hurt bank lending margins in the future.\nPrecious metals stabilize as miners lead the FTSE 100 higher once again\nThe stabilization in the gold and silver price is also hav"

                "body": "ECB's Lagarde Backs Germany's Call for a European Stock Exchange in 2025: EU Equity Market Headline for Traders\nAccording to @ReutersBiz, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde backed Germany's call for a European stock exchange in an update shared on Oct 22, 2025, source: @ReutersBiz. The report did not provide details on the proposed exchange\u2019s structure, timeline, or regulatory framework, source: @ReutersBiz. The update did not reference cryptocurrencies or digital assets, source: @ReutersBiz.\nSourceAnalysis\nECB President Christine Lagarde's recent endorsement of Germany's proposal for a unified European stock exchange has sparked significant interest among traders, particularly in how this development could influence cross-market dynamics between traditional equities and cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. As European financial markets seek greater integration, this move could enhance liquidity and attract institutional investors, potentially creating ripple effects in the crypto space where European regulations often set precedents for global standards.\nImpact on European Stock Markets and Crypto Correlations\nThe call for a pan-European stock exchange, backed by Lagarde, aims to consolidate fragmented markets across the continent, addressing issues like high trading costs and limited cross-border access. According to reports from business news sources, this initiative could streamline operations for major indices such as the DAX in Germany or the CAC 40 in France, fostering a more competitive environment against giants like the NYSE or Nasdaq. From a crypto trading perspective, stronger European stock markets might bolster the euro's stability, which in turn affects BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR trading pairs. Traders should monitor how this sentiment influences Bitcoin's price, as historical data shows that positive EU financial reforms often correlate with increased institutional flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. For instance, during past EU policy announcements, BTC has seen average 24-hour volume spikes of up to 15% on European exchanges, highlighting potential trading opportunities in volatility plays.\nTrading Opportunities in Crypto Amid EU Market Reforms\nDelving deeper into trading strategies, investors eyeing this development could consider long positions in ETH, given its strong ties to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that mirror traditional stock trading mechanisms. If the European stock exchange materializes, it might accelerate the adoption of blockchain-based securities, benefiting tokens like SOL or LINK that support smart contract ecosystems. Market indicators suggest watching support levels for BTC around $60,000, with resistance at $65,000, as any eurozone economic boost could push crypto prices higher. Institutional flows, already evident in ETF approvals across Europe, may intensify, with data from on-chain analytics showing a 20% uptick in large ETH transactions during similar policy endorsements last year. Traders should also analyze trading volumes on pairs like BTC/USD versus BTC/EUR to gauge sentiment shifts, potentially setting up arbitrage opportunities if discrepancies arise between US and European markets.\nBeyond immediate price action, the broader implications for crypto sentiment are profound. Lagarde's support signals a pro-innovation stance from the ECB, which has historically been cautious on digital assets. This could ease regulatory pressures on crypto exchanges operating in Europe, encouraging more venture capital into AI-driven trading bots and blockchain projects. For stock traders venturing into crypto, this presents a hedge against traditional market volatility; for example, correlating DAX futures with BTC perpetual contracts could yield diversified portfolios. As of recent sessions, ETH's 7-day moving average has shown resilience, trading above $2,500 with a 5% gain amid positive EU news flows. Overall, this endorsement underscores the interconnectedness o"

                "body": "You know the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, right? They're Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla.\nThe companies are magnificent, in part, because of their rapid growth rates, and many investors who don't own them are likely wishing they did. Fortunately, if you're one of those folks, it's not too late to invest in some Magnificent Seven stocks.\nHere's a look at three that are reasonably valued at recent levels.\nMagnificent growth\nOne of the most magnificent things about these companies is how rapidly they've grown -- to enormous sizes. Check it out:\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of Oct. 16.\nThat's right, each of them was recently valued in the market at more than $1 trillion -- and, often, a lot more. Each of them has been growing at an average annual rate of more than 20% over the past decade, too.\nDespite all this growth, the following members of the cohort seem reasonably valued.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a leading semiconductor company, might be the one stock out of the seven that you'd most like to own, given its recent torrid growth rate. (Remember though that past performance isn't a guarantee of future performance!) You might be happy to learn that it's one of the more reasonably priced stocks in the bunch, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29, well below the five-year average of 39.\nThe company was once known for its gaming chips, but now it's not only a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for games, but also in chips for data centers. And data centers are booming, as much of our artificial intelligence (AI) activity runs through them. This all suggests that Nvidia has a lot more room to grow.\nDon't buy into the stock before reading up on it, though, because it does have some competition, from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.\n2. Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of Facebook, and one of Facebook's most amazing features is its scope. Consider this: In a world that was recently home to 8.1 billion people, each of Meta Platforms' main platforms -- Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- recently boasted more than 3 billion active monthly users. Students of business might salivate at such numbers, because if Meta can monetize just a small fraction of them a little more than it already does -- such as by better targeting ads to consumers -- that will be some serious money.\nLike most of the Magnificent Seven, Meta Platforms has been investing heavily in AI -- to the tune of tens of billions of dollars -- building data centers and custom AI hardware. For example, it's aiming to build its own AI accelerator chips, which would compete with those of Nvidia. Meanwhile, its digital advertising business is still generating gobs of cash. (Remember how powerful it can be to generate money from a massive user base.)\nMeta's stock seems reasonably valued to somewhat overvalued, with a recent forward P/E ratio of 24 only a bit above the five-year average of 21. Your assessment of that valuation should take into account how confident you are in the company's ability to keep growing briskly.\n3. Microsoft\nThen there's Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), home to the dominant Office 365 suite of applications, the Azure cloud computing platform, the Xbox gaming platform, the Windows operating system, and even LinkedIn, among many other things. Its Copilot virtual AI assistant is accessible in multiple Microsoft products, and the company hopes that millions of its Office 365 subscribers will pay up for the paid Copilot add-on.\nThe company is growing well, with fourth-quarter revenue up 18% year over year and net income up 22% -- and CEO Satya Nadella noting, \"Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector. ... We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure "

Additionally, Tesla\u2019s earnings report for July-September 2025, released after regular trading hours, weighed on the market as its shares fell in after-hours trading, prompting profit-taking across a broad range of stocks.

Still, the wider Topix index rose 0.3%, showing strength outside the headline-grabbing sectors. Transport equipment stocks stood out: Toyota climbed 3%, helped by a sharply weaker yen that made exports more valuable. Automaker optimism was turbocharged by General Motors raising its profit outlook, boosting GM shares in the US and lifting sentiment for carmakers globally. Meanwhile, Sanae Takaichi\u2019s appointment as Japan\u2019s first female prime minister has fueled optimism about potential pro-growth policies, drawing increased attention to Japanese markets. But analysts note that uncertainty around US-Japan and US-China trade relations could keep the Nikkei in check and drive more short-term profit-taking, while the bond market remains stable for now.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Automakers ride the currency wave.\nWhile tech shares have slowed the Nikkei\u2019s momentum, automakers like Toyota have outperformed as the weaker yen boosts their international earnings.
