They also possess infrastructure to process, refine and distribute these goods around the world, supporting the energy supply chains.\nMentioned below are the 10 largest oil and gas loading terminals in the Middle East.\n1. Ras Laffan, Qatar\nThis port on the northeast coast of Qatar overlooks the Arabian Gulf and is the world\u2019s largest export facility for petrochemicals and hydrocarbons.\nIt lies within the Ras Laffan Industrial City and is strategically placed on the shipping route between the Far East and Europe.\nLATEST VIDEOS\nThe port spans 56 square kilometres and is designed to export LNG, LPG, condensates, petroleum products and sulphur, derived from the processing of gas extracted from the North Field Gas Reservoir.\nThere are 6 LNG berths, of which 4 can accommodate QMax ships with a 266,000 m3 capacity. The others can receive QFlex and conventional LNG carriers.\nAn additional 6 berths handle condensate, Pygas, GTL and refinery products. There is a sulphur berth and 6 berths for dry cargo, of which two also handle RORO.\n14 berths have facilities for offering bunkers and fresh water. They support ships involved in offshore exploration and production.\nTwo SPMs situated 54 km from the port can accommodate ships ranging from 85,000 to 320,000 DWT.\nAround 500 ships and 10,000,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this port.\n2. Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia\nSituated on Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern coast, Ras Tanura is the largest oil port in the world, handling 90% of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon exports and around 20% of the global consumption.\nIt can accommodate more than 2000 ships annually and load/unload 16 ships at once. It moves over 9 million barrels of hydrocarbons every day.\nIt has specialised terminals for crude oil, LPG, bunkering, etc.\nThe North Pier handles LPG, naphtha, crude oil, products and bunkers. It also includes 4 interconnected Sea Islands with berths for crude and fuel oil.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah Crude Terminal, 18 nm northwest of Ras Tanura, has an oil platform, a control platform, and 6 Single Point Mooring buoys for crude oil and bunkers.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah LPG Terminal has a two-berth pier for loading refrigerated liquefied petroleum gas (RLPG) onto LPG carriers.\nRas Tanura\u2019s storage capacity is more than 50 million barrels.\n3. Port of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates\nLocated 70 nm from the Strait of Hormuz, this is the world\u2019s second biggest hub for supplying fuel to vessels, serving over 12,000 each year.\nThe port operates 24/7 and has deep-water berths, bulk loaders, a large anchorage and houses the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone.\nEstablished in 1983, it is a key facility in the Middle East, handling exports and imports of crude oil, fuel products, and liquid bulk, supported by extensive storage facilities and the ADCOP pipeline.\nIt is a crucial maritime gateway to the Indian subcontinent, GCC countries and North Africa. Around 19,900,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this facility.\nApart from liquids, it also deals with dry bulk like aggregates, limestone, etc and general cargo, containers, and cruise vessels.\n4. The Al Ba\u015frah Oil Terminal (ABOT) & Khawr al \u2018Am\u012byah Oil Terminal (KAAOT), Iraq\nThese are Iraq\u2019s major offshore, deep-sea crude oil export facilities in the Persian Gulf, 50 km southeast of the Al-Faw Peninsula.\nThey are Iraq\u2019s sister terminals and function as the main platforms for exporting its crude oil. ABOT is a bigger facility with many berths, while KAAOT is comparatively smaller in size.\nAl-Basra Oil Terminal has a steel island structure with 4 berths, which can handle 4 tankers at once on 2 platforms, having a DWT of 35,000 to 350,000 tonnes.\nThe terminal\u2019s capacity exceeds 3.3 million bpd, and KAAOT has an export capacity of 400,000 bpd.\nBoth terminals are heavily guarded and are under the con"

US shale oil and gas would collapse by 35 per cent in the first year after drilling stopped, it added.\nThe IEA also said that as oil and gasfields decline, the world\u2019s fuel supplies will gradually become concentrated in the Middle East and Russia, whose giant fields decline more slowly.\nThe market share of Opec and Russia may rise from around 43 per cent today to more than 65 per cent by 2050, it said."

It was also boosted by ECB\u2019s Isabel Schnabel comments that \u201cinterest rates are in a good place as inflation stabilizes around our 2% target, and the economy remains resilient at full employment.\u201d\n- US Retail Sales are projected to slow in August, rising 0.3% MoM versus 0.5% previously, which may further pressure DXY downward.\n- Industrial Production for the same month is expected to drop -0.1% MoM, a tenth lower from the previous month print.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six peers, is down 0.28% at 97.34.\n- Fitch Ratings Agency expects two 25 basis rate cuts, each in September and December, with three more reductions penciled in 2026. Conversely, the ratings agency does not project any rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) again.\n- Across the pond, the European Central Bank (ECB) held rates unchanged, adopting a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, while not pre-committing to a set path on interest rates.\nTechnical outlook: EUR/USD stays firm above 1.1750, eyes on 1.1800\nEUR/USD uptrend remained intact on Monday, though the pair is shy of cracking the latest cycle high hit on September 9 at 1.1779. This could open the path to challenge 1.1800, setting the stage to test the year-to-date (YTD) high of 1.1829.\nOn the flip side, if EUR/USD slides below 1.1750, sellers could drive the exchange rate to 1.1700. A breach of the latter will expose the 20-day SMA at 1.1688 and the 50-day SMA at 1.1660.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone.

The euro has regained momentum following last week\u2019s turbulence around France\u2019s debt downgrade, while the U.S. dollar remains on the defensive ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision. Despite the uncertainty, the pair has consolidated in the 1.1720\u20131.1750 range, with traders reluctant to commit ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.\nFed Rate Outlook and Dollar Weakness Shape EUR/USD\nMarkets are pricing in a 25-basis-point Fed cut with more than 90% probability, while some models still account for a 12% chance of a 50-point move. Softer U.S. jobs data, including initial jobless claims climbing to 263,000\u2014the highest since June 2023\u2014has reinforced expectations of easing. Meanwhile, inflation remains mixed: August consumer prices rose 0.4% month-on-month and 2.9% annually, slightly above expectations. With President Trump openly pressuring for deeper cuts, markets are leaning toward a dovish outcome, which could weaken the dollar further and push EUR/USD toward resistance.\nECB Policy Divergence and Lagarde\u2019s Optimism Support the Euro\nThe ECB last week held its deposit rate steady at 2.00%, signaling confidence in the region\u2019s outlook. President Christine Lagarde stressed that risks to growth are more balanced and noted progress on disinflation. Traders have scaled back bets on additional ECB cuts, with odds for further easing before spring now below 40%. This divergence against a Fed that is set to cut rates gives the euro a relative advantage, helping EUR/USD stay supported above 1.1700 despite broader political headwinds in Europe.\nImpact of France\u2019s Downgrade and Eurozone Bond Yields\nFitch\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign rating from AA- to A+, the weakest from a major agency on record, initially pressured the euro. Political turmoil, with Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s resignation and S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s appointment as Prime Minister, added to volatility. Yet the damage has been contained, with French 10-year yields climbing to 3.5% and the 30-year rising toward 4.33%, still below early September peaks that triggered heavier euro selling. Investors now see the Fed\u2019s stance as more decisive for near-term EUR/USD than European credit dynamics.\nRead More\n-\nIWY ETF Climbs to $270.12 Backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and AI Growth\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Trades Above $115K\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Prediction: HG=F Climbs to $4.60 as Supply Strain Meets Fed Policy Shift\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Stuck at 147.6 With Fed and BOJ Decisions in Focus\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Outlook: Support at 1.1700, Resistance at 1.1780\u20131.1830\nFrom a technical perspective, EUR/USD remains inside a bullish channel that has guided price action since early September. Key support lies at 1.1700\u20131.1720, reinforced by the 50-period EMA at 1.1720 and the 200-period EMA at 1.1690. To the upside, resistance is clustered at 1.1756, then 1.1780\u20131.1790, with the channel top converging near 1.1830. Momentum remains cautiously positive: RSI is at 53\u201356, showing neither overbought nor oversold conditions, while MACD lines are preparing for a potential bullish cross. A break above 1.1800 would open room toward 1.1830\u20131.1900, while failure to hold 1.1700 risks a slide back to 1.1660.\nMarket Sentiment: Rangebound Until Fed Decision\nWith no major Eurozone data releases and only ECB speakers Lagarde and Schnabel on the agenda, traders are focused almost exclusively on the Fed.

Sterling has strung together three consecutive weekly gains, advancing from lows near 1.3150 in August to current levels, as traders shift focus to central bank policy meetings on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFed Rate Cut Bets Pressure the Dollar\nMarket pricing shows nearly a 100% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed\u2019s September 16\u201317 meeting, which would lower the federal funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%. With unemployment claims spiking close to four-year highs and sentiment indices collapsing, pressure is mounting on the Fed to signal more easing into year-end. Inflation at 2.9% in August complicates the message, but Powell\u2019s remarks will be decisive. A dovish dot plot projecting rates closer to 3.00%\u20133.25% by end-2026 would confirm bearish momentum for the dollar, allowing GBP/USD to test the 1.3620\u20131.3650 resistance band.\nBank of England Steady as UK Budget Concerns Linger\nThe Bank of England meets on September 18, with markets widely expecting no policy change and the base rate to remain at 4.00%. UK inflation is running at 3.8%, almost double the target, limiting scope for cuts. However, political and fiscal pressures are intensifying, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing scrutiny over a widening deficit and speculation of higher taxes in the November budget. The last vote split at the BoE was 5\u20134 in favor of a cut, underscoring a fragile consensus. Any fresh dissent could weaken sterling even as dollar weakness provides support.\nRead More\n-\nIWY ETF Climbs to $270.12 Backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and AI Growth\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Trades Above $115K\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Prediction: HG=F Climbs to $4.60 as Supply Strain Meets Fed Policy Shift\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Stuck at 147.6 With Fed and BOJ Decisions in Focus\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nUK and U.S. Data Divergence Shapes Momentum\nSterling\u2019s advance comes despite domestic softness, with July GDP growth stalling and industrial output underwhelming. In contrast, U.S. data has been mixed \u2014 softer labor and manufacturing numbers outweighing sticky inflation. This divergence has tilted positioning in favor of the pound, but limits its upside beyond 1.36 unless the Fed delivers a strongly dovish signal. Short-term momentum indicators show RSI above 60 and the 50-EMA crossing higher over the 200-EMA near 1.3487, signaling a potential golden cross if strength continues.\nTechnical Levels Define the Battle Zone\nThe breakout above 1.3575 confirmed bullish momentum, breaking a multi-week triangle pattern. Immediate support is at 1.3547 (50-EMA) and 1.3530, with further downside risk opening at 1.3370 if Fed communication surprises hawkishly. On the topside, resistance stands at 1.3621, followed by 1.3653, and then the broader four-year high near 1.3788. Price action is compressing along the upper Bollinger band, suggesting a potential volatility spike after central bank announcements.\nMarket Stance and Outlook for GBP/USD\nSterling\u2019s path is tied to relative central bank credibility. If the Fed signals an extended easing cycle, GBP/USD could push through 1.36 and retest 1.3788 highs, confirming a bullish breakout. If Powell leans cautious while BoE members hint at fiscal or policy risks, the pair risks sliding back toward 1.3370. Given the balance of risks, GBP/USD remains tilted bullish in the near term but capped by UK fundamentals. The stance here is Buy on dips toward 1.3550 with targets at 1.3650"

The US Dollar (USD) backslid across the board to start the fresh trading week, with investors gearing up for a critical interest rate call from the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nTraders will be looking to see if the Fed meets or exceeds market expectations for rate cuts through the remainder of the year when the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), also known as the 'dot plot' of policymakers\u2019 rate expectations, is also released during Wednesday\u2019s rate call. Markets are betting that the Fed will deliver three rate cuts before the end of the year, with rate markets pricing in nearly 75% odds that the Fed will cut rates by 75 basis points before January, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\nBoE expected to stand pat, UK CPI equally unremarkable\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is also expected to deliver its own interest rate decision on Thursday, but the UK\u2019s central bank is broadly expected to vote 7-to-2 in favor of keeping rates where they are for the time being. UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is also due on Wednesday, and is expected to show a slight acceleration in inflation pressures, with annualized headline CPI inflation forecast to clock in around 3.9% YoY versus the previous period\u2019s 3.8%. Core UK CPI inflation over the same period is expected to tick down to 3.6% from 3.8%.\nUS Retail Sales figures for August are due on Tuesday, but overall impacts are likely to be muted as markets keep both eyes locked on the Fed\u2019s rate call on Wednesday. Monthly Retail Sales figures are expected to ease to 0.3% MoM from 0.5%. While markets are unlikely to react strongly, backsliding Retail Sales volumes will be the cherry on top of slumping jobs data and stubborn inflation metrics as recession fears continue to grow.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release f"

Miran will be the first executive-branch official to serve on the central bank\u2019s board since 1935.\n- The US Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, though there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Markets have also factored in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\n- Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. In separate notes on Friday, the brokerages projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\n- Traders are now expecting multiple Fed rate cuts after US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims climbed to their highest since October 2021, following last week\u2019s weak Nonfarm Payrolls report, overshadowing a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading.\n- The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday that China\u2019s Retail Sales rose 3.4% year-over-year (YoY) in August vs. 3.8% expected and 3.7% in July. Chinese Industrial Production increased 5.2% YoY in the same period, compared to the 5.8% forecast and 5.7% seen previously.\n- The NBS said during its press conference on Monday that economic operation was generally steady in August, but domestic demand will expand and promote a rebound in prices. Some firms are having difficulties in operations as the external environment is very severe, NBS added.\nAustralian Dollar eyes 11-month highs near 0.6700\nAUD/USD is trading around 0.6660 on Tuesday.

Industrial production expanded 5.2% y/y, down from 5.8% in August and below the market estimate of 5.7%. This was the lowest pace of growth since August 2024, as manufacturing activity slowed and domestic remained weak.\nChina's retail sales rose 3.4% y/y in September, below 3.7% in August and the market estimate of 3.8%. This was the slowest pace since November 2024 and the third straight month of acceleration. There was more bad news on the labor front, as the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.3% from 5.2%, the highest level since February.\nThe US-China trade war is weighing on China's economy and the government is pushing exporters to find news markets. If that boosts economic activity, it will be good news for Australia, as China is its largest trading partner.\nInvestors are keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve, which is virtually certain to lower rates on Wednesday. The Fed hasn't cut rates since December 2024, which means that a cut will be a significant move, even if it has been priced in by the markets.

The pair closed at \u00a5147.66, after trading as high as \u00a5148.07 last week, showing the market\u2019s reluctance to break the range before this week\u2019s major central bank decisions.\nFed Policy Expectations Drive Correlation With USD/JPY\nMarket pricing shows four 25-basis-point cuts from the Federal Reserve by June 2026, totaling around 109 basis points. This expectation has tightened the negative correlation between rate cut pricing and USD/JPY to -0.87, meaning the pair moves almost inversely to Fed expectations. The Fed is widely expected to cut 25 bps this week, taking the funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%. If the dot plot signals a funds rate near 3.00\u20133.25% by end-2026, aligned with market pricing, USD/JPY may remain stable. However, a more aggressive six-cut outlook would likely push the yen higher, testing \u00a5146.00 and below.\nU.S. Economic Data and Labour Market Pressures\nThe U.S. economy is flashing signs of strain. Weekly jobless claims spiked to levels not seen in almost four years, while consumer sentiment dropped sharply according to the University of Michigan survey. Inflation, however, surprised to the upside at 2.9% year-on-year in August, complicating the Fed\u2019s messaging. Weakness in retail sales or further deterioration in the Empire State Manufacturing Index \u2014 expected to fall from 11.9 to 3 \u2014 could accelerate dovish bets, pushing USD/JPY lower toward \u00a5146.20, the 50-day EMA.\nBank of Japan Balances Dovish Tone Against Market Pressure\nThe Bank of Japan meets this week with its policy rate at 0.5%, and markets are pricing a 20% chance of a hike. Since lifting rates in July 2024 and again in January 2025, the BOJ has signaled a pause, but political uncertainty following Prime Minister Ishiba\u2019s resignation has weakened sentiment. Traders see around two hikes priced through mid-2026, but Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s dovish reputation keeps expectations muted. If his tone shifts hawkish, USD/JPY could drop rapidly below \u00a5146.00, while vague or cautious guidance would reinforce resistance at \u00a5149.00.\nSafe-Haven Yen Demand on Global Market Stress\nThe yen has found modest support from safe-haven demand amid Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign rating to AA-, raising fears of European debt contagion. This risk-sensitive backdrop lifted the yen to \u00a5147.39 earlier this week. However, broader flows show investors still favoring U.S. yields, keeping the yen capped. The correlation of USD/JPY with equity volatility has collapsed, meaning risk appetite has little impact compared to the rate differential story.\nRead More\n-\nIWY ETF Climbs to $270.12 Backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and AI Growth\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Trades Above $115K\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Prediction: HG=F Climbs to $4.60 as Supply Strain Meets Fed Policy Shift\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Holds 1.3585 With Fed and BoE in Spotlight\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY Levels\nOn charts, USD/JPY momentum indicators remain flat.

                "body": "- The Japanese Yen attracts some buyers amid expectations for an imminent BoJ rate hike.\n- Fed rate cut bets undermine the USD and weigh on USD/JPY ahead of central bank events.\n- Political and BoJ, along with a positive risk tone, might cap gains for the safe-haven JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) spikes to a one-week high and remains on track to appreciate further against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) amid the divergent Bank of Japan (BoJ)-Federal Reserve (Fed) policy expectations. Investors seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path, while the US central bank will resume its rate-cutting cycle this week. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor driving flows towards the lower-yielding JPY and exerting downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nMeanwhile, the recent political developments in Japan could give the BoJ reasons to delay rate hikes. This, along with a positive risk tone, might keep a lid on any further appreciating move for the safe-haven JPY. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait for this week's key central bank events. The Fed is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Wednesday ahead of the two-day BoJ meeting starting Thursday, which will provide a fresh impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen is underpinned by BoJ rate hike bets, bearish USD\n- The Japanese Yen has been struggling for a firm near-term direction over the past week or so and oscillating in a range against its American counterpart amid ambiguity over the Bank of Japan rate hike decision. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation added a layer of uncertainty in the markets and could give the BoJ more reasons to go slow on interest rate hikes.\n- Japan's farm minister and the chief government spokesperson, Shinjiro Koizumi, on Tuesday announced his candidacy to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replace the outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.\n- Meanwhile, the US-Japan trade deal has removed some risks to domestic growth. The BoJ sees the development paving the way for steady progress toward the inflation target. Moreover, a tight labor market and optimistic economic outlook keep the door open for an imminent BoJ interest rate hike by the end of this year and offer some support to the JPY.\n- Moreover, the current market pricing points to a nearly two full 25-basis-point rate hikes by July next year, which, in turn, warrants some caution before placing aggressive JPY bearish bets. Traders might also opt to wait on the sidelines ahead of the latest BoJ monetary policy update on Friday. This, along with a bearish US Dollar, should cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near its lowest level since July 24 amid rising bets for a more aggressive policy easing by the US Federal Reserve. Traders ramped up their bets for three interest rate cuts by the Fed this year after the recent US macroeconomic data pointed to signs of a softening labor market.\n- The US Senate voted to confirm Stephen Miran \u2013 one of US President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisers \u2013 to join the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. Miran will now be voting on this week's interest rate decision. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who can participate in the pivotal two-day meeting starting Tuesday.\n- On the geopolitical front, Trump said on Monday that a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is difficult. This comes amid the intensifying Russia-Ukraine war and brewing Middle East tensions, which could further benefit the safe-haven JPY ahead of the key central bank events.\n- Tuesday's US economic docket features the release of US monthly Retail Sales figures and Industrial Production data later during the North American session. The immediate market reaction is more likely to be muted as traders might refrain"

The pair depreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could have received support from the improved Oil prices. WTI price received support after a potential supply disruption from Russia following Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure and mounting US pressure on buyers of Russian crude.\nMarkets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on Wednesday. Expectations for BoC easing have increased after data showed a loss of roughly 65,500 jobs in August and a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.1%. Traders will likely observe Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on Tuesday, which could influence the central bank\u2019s policy outlook.\nThe US Dollar (USD) depreciates against its peers as traders expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting due on Wednesday. However, there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut, with markets factoring in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\nTraders will also likely observe the Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the \u2018dot plot,\u2019 where each member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects the federal funds rate in the near future.\nMarkets are broadly expecting the Fed to deliver three straight 25 basis-point interest rate cuts through the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. Both brokerage firms projected on Friday a 25-basis-point rate reduction at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to"

                "body": "GBP/JPY retreats from yearly high, holds above 200.00 ahead of UK jobs report\n|- GBP/JPY drifts lower on Tuesday and snaps a three-day winning streak to the YTD peak.\n- BoJ rate hike bets benefit the JPY and exert some downward pressure on spot prices.\n- Traders look to the UK jobs data for a short-term impetus ahead of key central bank events.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts some selling during the Asian session on Tuesday and for now, seems to have snapped a four-day winning streak to its highest level since July 2024, around the 200.75 region, touched the previous day. Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the 200.00 psychological mark as traders look forward to the UK employment details for a fresh impetus ahead of the key central bank events.\nThe UK jobs report, along with Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, could offer critical insight into the trajectory of inflation and its wider implications on monetary policy. A stronger-than-expected CPI print could further reduce the odds for an immediate interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), which is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday. This, in turn, could provide a goodish lift to the British Pound (GBP) and assist the GBP/JPY cross to attract some dip-buyers at lower levels.\nAhead of the key data, a broadly firmer Japanese Yen (JPY) exerts some downward pressure on spot prices. Despite domestic political turmoil, investors seem convinced that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor underpinning the JPY. That said, the uncertainty over the likely timing and the pace of rate hikes by the BoJ might cap gains for the JPY and help limit deeper losses for the GBP/JPY cross.\nFurthermore, the prevalent risk-on environment \u2013 as depicted by a generally positive mood around the equity markets \u2013 could offer some support to the currency pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the GBP/JPY cross has topped out in the near-term and positioning for any meaningful corrective decline.\n(The story was corrected on September 16 at 05:39 GMT, to say in the title, the third bullet point and the first paragraph that traders now look to UK jobs data, and not UK CPI.)\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards. It is the inflation measure used in the government\u2019s target. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Sep 17, 2025 06:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 3.9%\nPrevious: 3.8%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase of interest rates or the reduction of bond-buying by the BOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates looser monetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "After the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, miners are facing harsh realities. The halving sharply reduced the rewards for new Bitcoin, resulting in a substantial decrease in mining revenues. This is happening at a time when electricity costs are on the rise, pushing the cost to generate a single Bitcoin to over $70,000. All this means that operational costs are outpacing earnings, especially for smaller mining operations that could see negative margins if the market doesn't bounce back soon.\nHow are miners managing the electricity price surge?\nIn light of soaring energy prices, miners are increasingly opting for renewable energy. Currently, more than 50% of Bitcoin mining operations derive their energy from facilities that produce renewable electricity, such as hydropower, wind, and solar. Many mines are being constructed in regions where such energy sources are plentiful, such as the Southwest U.S., Latin America, and Central Asia.\nWhat strategies are miners adopting to stay afloat?\nSmaller miners are pooling their resources to bolster their survival chances. By banding together in mining pools, they can combine their hashing power, which also helps to stabilize their income.\nNotably, these collaborations are not just limited to Bitcoin but also include staking and other blockchain services, offering them multiple revenue streams as Bitcoin mining income shrinks.\nWhat are the benefits of upgrading hardware?\nNewer, energy-efficient ASIC hardware is holding big promise for miners\u2019 profitability and prospects in the uncertain market. This equipment offers substantial energy savings and greater efficiency while addressing the rise in mining difficulty.\nThe future of Bitcoin mining appears to be leaning heavily towards renewable energy. It offers a potential solution to rising costs and a more sustainable path forward.\nWhy is renewable energy important in Bitcoin mining?\nRenewable electricity is becoming increasingly vital for Bitcoin mining. The shift to clean energy addresses both rising operation costs and the public\u2019s demand for sustainability. As these energy sources gain traction among miners, Bitcoin mining's carbon emissions are expected to decline.\nPolicymakers are aware of this shift, with incentives for renewable energy use and potential carbon taxes looming on the horizon. The immediate future of mining will increasingly rely on renewable energy to remain viable in a world where regulatory pressure is only expected to increase."

Buying pressure accelerated midweek: $364 million on Monday, $23 million Tuesday, $741 million Wednesday, $553 million Thursday, and $642 million Friday. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) absorbed over $1 billion, Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) collected $850 million, and Ark\u2019s ARKB plus Bitwise ETFs captured meaningful inflows.

Still, U.S. equities remain overheated, and recession risks could temper bullish momentum. ETF inflows are creating a structural demand floor that helps offset macro uncertainties.\nEthereum and Solana ETFs Record Parallel Gains\nEthereum (ETH-USD) ETFs brought in $646 million last week, ending a period of sustained outflows, while ETH gained 4.6% to $4,500. Solana (SOL-USD) ETFs registered their largest daily inflow on record, $145 million on Friday, totaling $198 million for the week. That drove SOL from $214 to $239, an 11.6% weekly surge. Bitcoin continues to lead inflows with $2.4 billion, but the rising activity in Ethereum and Solana ETFs shows institutions are broadening their crypto allocations.\nAltcoin Allocations Pose Risks to Treasuries\nWhile Bitcoin dominates institutional portfolios, some corporate treasuries testing altcoin exposure have underperformed. Executives such as David Bailey of Nakamoto warn that overreliance on weak altcoins risks damaging balance sheets. The narrative remains clear: Bitcoin is the institutional reserve anchor, while altcoin allocations remain speculative and volatile.\nBuy, Sell, or Hold Verdict on Bitcoin\nETF inflows are the new foundation of Bitcoin demand.

It would shoot first and then ask questions later.\u201d He explained that his goal is to rebuild trust in the agency\u2019s procedures:\nWhat I am trying to address is a market perception that \u2026 there was a lack of due process, a lack of notice, a lack of rule of law.\nReferencing an early career lesson to explain his approach, the SEC Chair stated that those who deceive investors and commit fraud, like disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, will face severe consequences, including losing all assets. However, he stressed that enforcement should not be excessive, noting: \u201cYou can\u2019t just suddenly come and bash down their door and say \u2018uh-uh we caught you, you\u2019re doing something and it\u2019s a technical violation\u2019.\u201d\nRejecting fines that scaled with company revenues, Atkins argued for a model that allowed time for compliance before sanctions were imposed.\nThe SEC\u2019s direction on cryptocurrency also illustrates this shift. Atkins is advocating for rules that enable tokenized securities and blockchain-based trading, while keeping activity within U.S. borders. \u201cWe want people not to be doing this offshore,\u201d he stated, referencing the collapse of FTX as a warning about overseas risks. He pointed to the exchange\u2019s U.S. derivatives arm as proof of the benefits of oversight:\nIt\u2019s a really powerful example of how a good regulatory scheme can help to protect investors while something else offshore is not going to be adequate.\nStill, he cautioned companies already trading tokenized U.S. stocks: \u201cThe securities laws do apply if they\u2019re trading securities.\u201d Atkins believes most crypto tokens are not securities."

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s journey towards the highly anticipated $5,000 level is taking the limelight, but a fresh DeFi altcoin is quietly receiving the spotlight. Mutuum Finance, one of the newest decentralized lending protocols in the market, is attracting growing interest among analysts who feel that its risk-sharing model and sustainable models for yields make it the standout choice in the current market cycle.\nThe token is currently underpriced at $0.035 during stage 6 of its presale. As Ethereum continues to maintain its momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a coin with increasingly strong bull run potential, which is again generating fresh discussion regarding where the smartest capital may be headed in the next several months.\nEthereum (ETH) is sitting at $4,437.37, with most of its recent sessions seeing it trade in the $4,300\u2013$4,500 area. Though hopes exist for ETH touching $5,000\u2013$5,500 later in 2025 if ETF demand picks up and volume returns, short-term momentum is also looking muted, resistance in the $4,500 area remaining an obstacle and certain technical indicators looking mixed. As ETH stabilizes, newer DeFi-oriented tokens are also on investors\u2019 radars, such as Mutuum Finance.\nMutuum Finance is providing investors with a chance to invest in the project when it is just at the initial phase of its development so that investors have the chance to buy the tokens at a very low cost. The token is being offered at one MUTM worth $0.035, while during the seventh token sale phase, the token will be offered at $0.04. Presale has been successful with over $15.63 million funds raised and token holders totaling over 16,240. Such demand positions MUTM on a strong footing compared to other DeFi protocols.\nThe latest news regarding the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is a bug bounty hunt where the participants will share a $50,000 USDT reward for finding any possible defect in its codebase. The project is already live and accessible to the masses. The developers have not only been engaged in building the platform but are also occupied with serving its users and investors.\nMutuum Finance relies on a two-tiered lending structure, a hybrid P2C and P2P lending structure with greater competitive advantage. With P2C, the smart contracts are walking the market round the clock to calculate interest payments, investors are investing at lower interest charges, and borrowers are lending at even lower cost of interest with investors earning their interest passively through the smart contracts. P2P facilitates borrowing and lending between the counterparties without an intermediary and thus a completely decentralized lending product and best suited for volatile or risky assets such as meme coins.\nFor enabling timely and accurate price information, Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles cross-referencing token prices with heavily traded securities such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and in-chain data are also utilized across the platform to provide up-to-date and precise price information. These protocols form the foundation of collateral pricing, risk management, and liquidation process, hence allowing the protocol to execute efficiently and be stable irrespective of the diverse conditions in the marketplace.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as Ethereum (ETH) aims to break to $5,000. Stage 6 presale tokens now sell at $0.035, and Stage 7 will move price to $0.04. The project has raised $15.63M and gained 16,240+ holders, a sign of high demand. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, double P2C/P2P lending protocol, and Chainlink-powered price discovery, MUTM unites security, innovation, and sustainable yield. With ETH staying steady at approximately $4,437, Mutuum Finance is an extremely leveraged DeFi trade. Lock in Stage 6 tokens now before the next price spike.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linkt"

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH), the foundational blockchain for countless decentralized applications, is poised for a significant surge, with recent analyses projecting its value to reach an impressive $9,801 by 2030. This optimistic forecast is not mere speculation but is firmly anchored in several transformative trends shaping the cryptocurrency landscape: the escalating adoption of Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions, the burgeoning influx of new institutional staking products, and the sustained, vigorous expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activities.\nThis potential ascent of Ethereum carries profound implications for the entire crypto market, signaling a maturing ecosystem and potentially redirecting capital flows. Investors and market participants are now closely watching how these intertwined developments will reshape the future of digital finance and the broader Web3 economy, cementing Ethereum's role as a cornerstone of decentralized innovation.\nThe Triple Engines of Growth: Layer-2s, Institutional Staking, and DeFi/NFT Boom\nThe anticipated climb of Ethereum to nearly $10,000 is underpinned by a confluence of technological advancements and market dynamics. Each driver plays a critical role in enhancing Ethereum's utility, accessibility, and appeal to a widening demographic of users and institutions.\nLayer-2 networks are at the forefront of this transformation. As Ethereum's mainnet grapples with scalability challenges, L2 solutions like Arbitrum (ARBITRUM) and Optimism (OP) have emerged as vital conduits, offloading transaction processing from the main blockchain while maintaining its security. By reducing gas fees and speeding up transaction times, L2s are making the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly and economically viable for a broader range of applications and users. Industry experts, including VanEck, foresee a colossal $1 trillion collective market capitalization for Ethereum's Layer-2 protocols by 2030, a testament to their pivotal role in scaling the network and driving its adoption. This expansion is critical, ensuring that Ethereum can handle the increasing demand stemming from DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications without succumbing to network congestion or prohibitive costs.\nSimultaneously, the crypto world is witnessing an unprecedented influx of institutional interest, particularly in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking mechanism. The introduction of institutional-grade staking products and the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are monumental catalysts. These regulated investment vehicles provide traditional financial institutions and their clients with a secure and compliant pathway to gain exposure to ETH, which was previously a barrier for many. Analysts suggest that these ETFs will not only attract substantial capital but also effectively remove a significant amount of ETH from circulation as it gets staked, contributing to a potential supply squeeze. This institutional embrace, evidenced by major firms accumulating ETH at a pace exceeding retail demand, indicates a structural shift that could exert sustained upward pressure on Ethereum's price. Companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Fidelity (FNF) are among those expected to play a key role in facilitating this institutional adoption through their various staking and custodial services.\nFinally, the relentless expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity continues to cement Ethereum's dominance. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of the DeFi landscape, commanding the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) by a significant margin compared to other blockchains. This dominance means that the vast majority of innovative financial applications, from lending protocols to decentralized exchanges, operate on or are closely integrated with Ethereum. The thriving NFT market, too, predominantly relies on Ethereum, with iconic marketplaces like OpenSea and prominent colle"

The surge of stablecoins on Ethereum, now exceeding $168 billion, signals an unmistakable shift \u2014 one that\u2019s establishing the blockchain not merely as a platform for speculation but as a foundational element of a robust financial architecture.\nThe Emergence of Stablecoin Supremacy\nEthereum is not just another blockchain; it is emerging as the undisputed leader in the digital transaction arena. The current boom in stablecoin supply \u2014 fueled by titans like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) \u2014 is more than a statistical anomaly; it's a resounding statement of trust and practical utility. These stablecoins provide a financial lifeline to countless DeFi applications, infusing them with the liquidity and reliability needed to weather the storms of volatile cryptocurrencies.\nDeepening Institutional Connections\nThe impressive rise of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin ecosystem mirrors the evolving relationship between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Analysts are honing in on a critical insight: Ethereum is being increasingly viewed as a settlement layer for institutional operations. With significant liquidity flows indicating a paradigm shift, financial powerhouses are embracing stablecoins on Ethereum, effectively positioning it as the centerpiece of their cryptocurrency investment strategies.\nSetting the Stage for DeFi Expansion\nThe flourishing landscape of stablecoin activity acts as a catalyst for intensified DeFi engagement. A surge in stablecoin liquidity paves the way for skyrocketing transaction volumes, invigorating economic activity across decentralized markets. As Ethereum forges ahead, it bolsters platforms such as Uniswap and Aave, tapping into these assets for functions extending from lending to yield farming. The indications are clear: heightened DeFi activity will drive up the demand for Ethereum, further entrenching its importance.\nA New Era of Asset Tokenization\nThe advent of tokenizing traditional financial assets on the Ethereum blockchain marks another pivotal transformation. The introduction of substantial institutional assets, like U.S. Treasuries, into the Ethereum ecosystem heralds novel market dynamics that reflect both resilience and adaptability. Research suggests this trend enhances liquidity and broadens the spectrum of financial instruments available within DeFi, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between conventional and decentralized finance.\nThe Advantage of Swift Settlements\nThe inflow of massive liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem affords an exceptional opportunity for rapid and efficient transaction settlements. As demand for blockspace swells alongside stablecoin adoption, Ethereum\u2019s well-established infrastructure is well-positioned to mitigate transaction congestion. This ensures that both users and protocol operators experience a smooth journey within the ecosystem. Additionally, the flourishing of stablecoins may lead to attractive staking rewards for Ether holders, enticing broader participation in Ethereum's economic landscape.\nGazing into the Future of Ethereum\nThe clear appetite for Ethereum as a foundational DeFi platform is palpable. The swelling stablecoin supply not only hints at potential price growth but lays robust groundwork for sustained long-term expansion. Amidst a backdrop of market complexities, Ethereum emerges as a illuminating beacon for institutional investors aiming to navigate the fast-evolving realm of decentralized finance.\nConclusion\nIn essence, the burgeoning stablecoin supply within Ethereum represents more than transient market dynamics; it heralds a new wave of institutional trust. This evolution points towards Ethereum solidifying its foothold in the financial services realm, driven by the ongoing adoption of tokenized assets and rising stablecoin utilization.

                "body": "Key takeaways:\nCorporate treasury investments are driving consistent demand and strengthening SOL\u2019s price momentum.\nDEX dominance, fee growth, and interoperability upgrades reinforce Solana\u2019s competitive blockchain position.\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL\nfaced a sharp rejection after testing the $250 level on Sunday. Even with the correction, SOL gained 24% in the past 30 days, supported by stronger onchain activity.Traders are now debating whether the current momentum could push SOL toward $300, especially as the Solana network has regained its lead in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\nIn September, Solana surpassed Ethereum to become the top blockchain for DEX trading. The network processed $121.8 billion in monthly volumes, about 90% higher than competitor BNB Chain. Securing leadership in this segment is key because higher volumes generate more fees, which creates recurring demand for SOL to pay for those transactions.\nAccording to Nansen data, fees on Solana rose 23% over the past seven days. The increase is notable given that Ethereum still has nearly seven times more total value locked (TVL). Yet ETH holders see limited benefits from that base since many decentralized applications, including restaking and real-world assets (RWA), show low turnover and weak fee generation.\nCorporate treasury allocations accelerate demand for SOL\nRecent corporate treasury activity has boosted demand for SOL. Some companies are raising capital through stock or debt offerings and allocating the proceeds to cryptocurrency. One example is Forward Industries (FORD), originally a medical and technology design firm, which raised $1.65 billion in private funding and used the proceeds to acquire SOL for its reserves.\nForward Industries was financed by Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Jump Crypto \u2014 both a market maker and venture capital fund \u2014 and Multicoin Capital, known for early bets on Helium\n, Filecoin , Solana, and Polkadot . Separately, a Solana-focused treasury firm called DeFi Development Corp disclosed holdings exceeding 2 million SOL, valued at more than $460 million.Pantera Capital, another major blockchain asset manager, announced on Monday the launch of a new Solana-backed treasury vehicle, the Nasdaq-listed Helius (HSDT). The $500 million initial private placement was co-led by the Hong Kong-licensed fund manager Summer Capital and could expand to over $1 billion, according to the press release.\nRelated: Bitcoin and Solana ETPs lead $3.3B crypto inflow rebound: CoinShares\nAnother possible tailwind for SOL comes from a proposed open-source bridge between Solana and Base, an Ethereum layer-2 developed by Coinbase. Base has more than 20 million active addresses in 30 days, according to Nansen. The bridge would let users move assets across chains, creating what Base creator Jesse Pollak called a more \u201cinteroperable and connected\u201d ecosystem.\nThe Trump-backed crypto initiative World Liberty Financial (WLFI) also announced on Monday a partnership with Solana\u2019s memecoin platform Bonk.fun and the Raydium DEX to fund \u201cmultimillion-dollar promotional rewards.\u201d The effort targets USD1 stablecoin pairs, with WLFI\u2019s token reportedly backed entirely by US dollars and cash equivalents.\nConsidering Solana\u2019s expanding onchain activity, the accumulation of SOL by treasury-focused firms, and the visibility from the Base bridge and WLFI campaign, traders see conditions for further upside. A rally to $300 would give Solana a $163 billion market capitalization, still representing a 70% discount to Ether\u2019s $543 billion valuation, making the scenario plausible in the near term.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

                "body": "TLDR\n- Forward Industries acquired 6.8 million Solana tokens as part of its long-term Solana Treasury Strategy.\n- The total investment in Solana tokens amounts to approximately $1.58 billion.\n- Despite the acquisition, Forward Industries\u2019 stock has fallen more than 2% to $33.51.\n- The company\u2019s Solana holdings surpass those of other corporate treasuries, including DeFi Development Corp. and Upexi.\n- Forward Industries purchased the tokens at an average price of $232 per Solana token.\nOn September 15, Forward Industries (FORD) announced the acquisition of over 6.8 million Solana (SOL) tokens. The company has staked these tokens as part of its Solana Treasury Strategy. The total investment amounts to approximately $1.58 billion, with an average purchase price of $232 per token. Despite the scale of the acquisition, FORD\u2019s share price has declined by more than 2%, reaching $33.51 at the time of writing. However, the acquisition positions FORD above all other corporate treasuries holding Solana.\nForward Industries Acquires 6.8 Million Solana Tokens\nThe purchase of 6.8 million SOL tokens marks a significant milestone in Forward Industries\u2019 strategy. The company views Solana as one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems, and this acquisition signals their long-term commitment. According to Kyle Samani, Chairman of FORD\u2019s board, this investment goes beyond simply expanding their balance sheet.\n\u201cToday\u2019s purchase marks a significant milestone as Forward Industries begins executing its differentiated Solana treasury strategy,\u201d Samani explained.\nGalaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital have backed the company in this venture. They aim to capture value from Solana\u2019s growing ecosystem and deliver long-term value to shareholders. FORD\u2019s plans are clearly aligned with the development of Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, where they see considerable opportunity.\nFORD\u2019s Flexible Approach to On-Chain Transactions\nThe SOL tokens acquired by Forward Industries are non-locked, allowing for greater flexibility in future moves. FORD purchased the tokens through a combination of open market buys and on-chain transactions. This marks the first use of proceeds from their recent $1.65 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) round.\nThe company has emphasized its ability to operate across various platforms, including decentralized exchanges. FORD highlighted a notable $1 million transaction executed via DFlow, a Solana-based decentralized exchange aggregator. This trade is the first of many expected on-chain deployments, demonstrating FORD\u2019s adaptability to different markets and opportunities in the DeFi space."

                "body": "The blockchain landscape is witnessing a significant power shift as Solana, once plagued by network instability, experiences an impressive resurgence, challenging Ethereum's long-held dominance. Fueled by unparalleled transaction speeds, ultra-low fees, and a flourishing developer community, Solana is not only expanding its decentralized finance (DeFi) footprint and NFT market but has also demonstrably outperformed Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume during recent periods, while attracting substantial institutional interest. This meteoric rise signals a maturing ecosystem poised for continued growth and widespread adoption.\nSolana's Meteoric Rise: A Comprehensive Overview\nSolana's recent growth has been nothing short of remarkable, transforming it into a formidable player across critical blockchain sectors. Its expansion is evident in its burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, vibrant NFT market, increasing institutional engagement, and, notably, its recent outperformance of Ethereum in DEX volume.\nIn a pivotal moment for the crypto world, Solana's decentralized exchanges have shown compelling strength, surpassing Ethereum in monthly and daily trading volumes during several recent periods. In July, Solana's DEXs processed $54 billion in trading volume, exceeding Ethereum's $52 billion, marking the first time Solana's DEX activity eclipsed Ethereum's on a monthly basis. This translated to Solana holding 29% of DEX trades, slightly ahead of Ethereum's 28%. More recently, on January 6th, Solana recorded nearly $3.8 billion in 24-hour DEX trading volume, outperforming Ethereum ($1.7 billion) and its popular Layer-2 Base ($1.2 billion) combined. A significant driver of this volume is Raydium, Solana's leading DEX, which in November, reportedly surpassed Uniswap (Ethereum's top DEX) in monthly trading volumes by approximately 30%, reaching around $30 billion. This outperformance is largely attributed to Solana's core architectural advantages: high throughput, ultra-low transaction fees (often less than $0.01 on Solana's L2s compared to significantly higher fees on Ethereum's Layer 1), and rapid transaction finality. These features create an ideal environment for high-frequency trading, algorithmic activity, and memecoin trading.\nSolana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is experiencing a robust expansion, marked by a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL). As of September 9-10, 2025, Solana's TVL surged to approximately $12.2 billion, representing a remarkable 165% increase from $4.63 billion in September 2024. This achievement not only marks Solana's highest-ever TVL but also places it ahead of the combined TVL of major Ethereum Layer-2 networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. This growth is underpinned by Solana's technical architecture, which facilitates thousands of transactions per second (TPS) at minimal costs, fostering a scalable and user-friendly environment. Reports indicate that Solana's DeFi ecosystem now accounts for a dominant share, with 81% of all DEX transactions originating from its network in 2025. Key protocols contributing to this surge include Raydium and Jupiter DEX, as well as Jito's liquid staking, all of which have seen substantial inflows. The growing stablecoin supply on Solana, standing at approximately $12 billion, further provides a strong liquidity base for its DeFi activities.\nThe Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market on Solana has also witnessed impressive growth, establishing itself as a significant player in the digital collectibles space. As of February 2024, total NFT sales on Solana surpassed $5 billion. The market experienced a dramatic turnaround from mid-2023, with monthly sales volumes accelerating from $82 million in November to a record high of $365 million in December 2023. Over the nine months leading up to September 2025, Solana's NFT trading volume exceeded $1 billion. Solana's NFT ecosystem boasts a substantial user base, hosting over 2.2 million buyers and"

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.\nTesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.\nAlphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.\nThe market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.\nStocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.\nThat\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.\nWhat\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nAnother threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.\nTrump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors from its board.\n\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network Monday, using his trademark all-caps style.\nOn Wall Street, Intel rose 2.9% after trimming its forecast for expenses this year. The move came after it completed the sale of a 51% stake in its Altera business to the Silver Lake investment firm.\nThat helped offset a 24.7% drop for Hain Celestial, which reported a larger loss for its latest quarter than it did a year earlier. Interim CEO Alison Lewis said the owner of \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d brands like Terra chips is making moves to stabilize sales \u201cas we recognize our performance has not met expectations.\u201d\nAlaska Air Group lost 6.7% after the airline said high fuel costs will likely cause its third-quarter results to come in at the low end of its forecasted range. It also cited higher expenses for overtime pay and passengers\u2019 compensation after bad weather and air-traffic control issues led to difficult operations in the summer, though it saw strong airfare trends thanks to demand for premium seats.\nNvidia edged down by less than 0.1% after China accused the chip company of violating its antimonopoly laws. Chinese regulators did not mention a punishment for Nvidia in a one-sentence statement on the matter but did say they would carry out \u201cfurther investigation.\u201d\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 30.99 points to 6,615.28.

Shares fell 3.4%, leading pharma and biotech stocks down 2.6% and putting pressure on the broader FTSE 100, which edged 0.12% lower. A firmer pound added extra weight, hitting export-focused companies. But good news wasn\u2019t entirely in short supply: Sainsbury\u2019s shares jumped to a four-year high\u2014up 5%\u2014after dropping talks to sell Argos to JD.com, while AO World soared 11.3% on its first-ever share buyback and brighter profit outlook. With the FTSE 250 benefiting from this domestic confidence and investors gearing up for key central bank decisions, focus is shifting to how the Bank of England will steer policy amid ongoing inflation.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Retail resilience shines through pharma worries.\nAstrazeneca\u2019s retreat cast a shadow over the FTSE 100 and made clear just how much heavyweight sectors can stir up the broader market. But domestic momentum has been strong: positive updates from Sainsbury and AO World helped the FTSE 250 outperform, offering a glimpse of optimism even when blue-chips stumble. Central bank decisions could fuel ongoing volatility, but resilient retailers show there\u2019s still upside if you know where to look.\nThe bigger picture: Investment signals point to bigger UK shifts.\nThe UK\u2019s ability to attract blockbuster investment is under scrutiny as big pharma pump the brakes on growth, putting a spotlight on the need for clear policies and attractive business conditions. Meanwhile, new tech and civil nuclear deals with the US\u2014and negotiations over steel tariffs\u2014reflect an effort to strengthen global economic ties. These shifts, combined with looming monetary policy decisions, could steer how the UK navigates capital inflows and economic challenges moving forward.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 19 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "The FTSE 100\u2018s one of the best places in my opinion to buy passive income stocks. The UK\u2019s blue-chip share index is packed with stocks whose robust balance sheets, market-leading positions and diverse revenue streams make them great candidates for long-lasting dividend income.\nThe Footsie\u2018s enjoyed strong gains over the last year. This has in turn pulled the index\u2019s forward dividend yield down to 3.2%. That\u2019s at the lower end of the 3-4% long-term average investors have enjoyed.\nBut that\u2019s still far higher than other global share indices. And what\u2019s more, investors can still get far higher yields than this by selecting some choice individual shares.\nHere, I\u2019ll show you how investors could make a \u00a31,000 monthly passive income with a portfolio of FTSE-listed dividend shares.\nA 5-star portfolio\nCurrently, some of the FTSE 100\u2019s highest dividend shares operate in the financial services sector. The three I\u2019m choosing for our mini portfolio are Legal & General (LSE:LGEN), Phoenix Group and Aviva.\nLegal & General shares currently offer the highest dividend yield among this grouping, at 9%. Phoenix follows hot on its heels with an 8.5% yield. Aviva\u2019s lower but still offers a tasty 5.5%.\nEach of these businesses are market leaders and generate substantial amounts of cash they can distribute to shareholders. They also have excellent long-term growth potential as ageing populations and growing engagement in financial planning drive product demand.\nThe other companies our five-share dividend portfolio are packaging manufacturer Mondi \u2014 which stands to gain from the e-commerce boom \u2014 and defensive share National Grid. These shares yield 6.1% and 5.5% respectively.\nHeroic performance\nLegal & General\u2019s one of the FTSE 100\u2019s true dividend heroes, in my view. And that\u2019s not just because of its enormous, near-double-digit dividend yield.\nIt\u2019s raised annual dividends almost every year since the Great Financial Crisis. The only exception was in 2020 when it froze dividends during the pandemic. And even then, it performed better than many other blue-chips that slashed or cancelled dividends.\nLike other financial services providers, earnings are highly sensitive to broader economic conditions. And right now the outlook remains uncertain as inflation rises and the economy splutters.\nEncouragingly however, Legal & General has demonstrated resilience in this environment, with underlying operating profit climbing 6% in the first half It\u2019s also well capitalised to help it weather any volatility and keep paying large and growing dividends. Its Solvency II ratio was 217% as of June."

                "body": "European stock markets, led by a resurgent German DAX index, have delivered an unexpectedly strong performance in 2025, marking a significant turnaround from previous years. This robust growth, fueled by renewed investor confidence and strategic economic shifts, has seen key indices reach multi-year highs and even all-time records, positioning Europe as a compelling investment destination. The unexpected surge highlights a pivotal moment for the continent's financial landscape, promising potential ripple effects across various sectors and altering global investment flows.\nThe impressive gains signal a broader recalibration of investor perception towards European equities, driven by a confluence of attractive valuations, evolving monetary policies, and targeted fiscal stimuli. This performance not only defies earlier cautious forecasts but also underscores a growing conviction in the region's economic resilience and corporate profitability, setting the stage for a potentially transformative period for public companies and the wider European economy.\nA Continental Revival: What Happened and Why it Matters\nThe year 2025 has witnessed a remarkable resurgence across European stock markets, with the German DAX index taking center stage in this impressive rally. As of September 15, 2025, the DAX stood at an impressive 23,744 points, registering a substantial 27.43% increase over the past year. The index's year-to-date (YTD) return reached 20.88% by May and further climbed to 34.60% by early September, even touching an all-time high of 24,641.50 in July. This strong performance marks the first time in over two decades that European equities have significantly outperformed their U.S. counterparts, signaling a profound shift in global investment patterns.\nBeyond Germany, the optimism permeated broader European markets. The Morningstar Europe Index gained 6% in Q1 2025 and was up almost 11% YTD by May. The EURO STOXX 50 (STOXX: SX5E) surged 3.5% in February and saw a 10.81% increase in USD terms during Q1, reaching 5,426 points by mid-September and an all-time high of 5,568.65 in March. Similarly, the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX: SXXP) recorded its best start to a year since 2019 in absolute terms and its strongest relative start against the STOXX USA 500 since 2001. This collective ascent is not merely statistical; it signifies a pivotal moment where European markets are regaining investor trust and demonstrating robust fundamental strengths.\nSeveral factors have converged to propel this bullish trend. A crucial element has been the shift in investor sentiment, as evidenced by the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany, which rebounded sharply through mid-2025, reflecting growing optimism. Economically, Germany initiated a historic fiscal expansion, including a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund and increased defense spending, signaling a departure from its traditional fiscal conservatism. Simultaneously, the European Central Bank (ECB) began easing monetary policy with interest rate cuts, anticipated to stimulate the economy and corporate profitability. Furthermore, European stocks entered 2025 with attractive valuations compared to their US counterparts, drawing global investors seeking value and diversification.\nRobust corporate earnings throughout late 2024 and early 2025 also provided a significant impetus. Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 generally exceeded earnings expectations, and projections suggest that Europe's annualized profit growth could outpace the U.S. for the first time in over a decade. Geopolitical factors, such as hopes for de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict and increased defense spending across the EU, further stimulated economic activity and investor confidence. The relative underperformance of the US market in early 2025, driven by election uncertainty and trade tensions, also encouraged a reallocation of capital towards the more attractively valued European markets.\nNavigating the Boom: Winners Emerge Ac"

The market was last pricing in a 95.8% certainty that the central bank will lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point, with a meager 4.2% likelihood of a steeper half percentage point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\u201cThe market is fully expecting the Fed to start a series of rate cuts at this week\u2019s meeting,\u201d Scott Wren, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist, said. \u201cMuch of today\u2019s action is traders getting positioned for Wednesday\u2019s announcement. This could be a \u201cBuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d event but it is safe to say market participants likely to not want to go into Wednesday short the SPX.\u201d\nLower rates could continue to support the stock market, which has received a boost from investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, and despite risks to the economic outlook. Investors will also be watching the Senate to see if Stephen Miran will be sworn in as a Fed governor in time for this week\u2019s FOMC meeting."

                "body": "Fantasy Football: Brian Thomas Jr.'s worrisome start has a silver lining, and 9 other stats from Week 2 that stood out\nEach Monday, fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth will go over 10 important stats that you may have overlooked from Sunday. With so much going on, what keys to fantasy success are dug up that the masses may miss?\n35.7%\nBrian Thomas Jr\u2019s target share after Jarrian Jones left the game. Jones is a starting CB for Jacksonville, which, in most cases, usually doesn\u2019t affect fantasy stock when an injury happens to your own team\u2019s corner. However, in this case, it is notable that Travis Hunter started playing a majority of the Jaguars\u2019 defensive snaps due to the injury.\nCall me crazy, but I\u2019m not completely out on Thomas after the first couple of weeks. Twelve targets, two end-zone targets and 258 air yards in Week 2 is as good of volume as it gets.\nThe result wasn\u2019t pretty, but it wasn\u2019t for the same reason as Week 1. Last week, Trevor Lawrence only delivered three catchable targets to Thomas, whereas this week, plays were available to be made but just came up short in big moments.\nThe chemistry and on-field communication need improvement. The talent is there, though, and the Jaguars are still adapting to a fresh offense. Although on the surface it doesn\u2019t look like it, I believe Game 2 was a step in the right direction.\n9.5%\nMark Andrews targets per route this season. Bad. It\u2019s hard to find the silver lining when the excuses are no longer there. Andrews is healthy, running plenty of routes and is playing without TE2 Isaiah Likely. Andrews' route percentage increased from a very low 59% in 2024 to his old regular 76% in 2025.\nPart of it comes from natural TD regression. He scored nine touchdowns on nine end-zone targets last year, so already not scoring on his end-zone target Sunday is somewhat expected. But it\u2019s much more than that. He has been completely limited to a safety option rather than a downfield target.\nThrough two games, his air yards sit at 10. Ten air yards. Most players get that on a single target.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this bad for the entire season, but with Likely returning and Andrews being ultra-TD-dependent, I\u2019ll look elsewhere at the position in fantasy.\n[Upgrade to Fantasy Plus and gain your edge in player projections and much more]\n55.5%\nBhayshul Tuten\u2019s touches per snap. Not all backup running backs are the same. Some, say LeQuint Allen Jr., are on the field to give the starter a breather, maybe have a pass-blocking role or take the 3rd & 15 carries. That is NOT Bhayshul Tuten. He only played 25.7% of snaps in the first game without RB Tank Bigsby, but when he was on the field, he was the focal point of the offense.\nHe wasn\u2019t just giving Travis Etienne Jr. a breather. He played in the red zone at points, got a designed screen and started the second drive of the game. The point? His usage was not an accident. I by no means think Etienne is done for, but I do believe Tuten\u2019s role will only grow from here.\n100%\nQuinshon Judkins plays with a route or carry. Another rookie as the focal point. Judkins was very similar to Tuten, playing only 18 snaps, where on the eight passing plays in which he wasn\u2019t given the rushing attempt, he ran 100% of routes and was targeted three times. He led the team in touches despite Jerome Ford playing two times the RB snaps.\nRookie RB Dylan Sampson looks to be no more than a backup as he saw half the amount of Judkins\u2019 touches on the same amount of snaps. Judkins should lead the committee RB room in a shaky offense. The upside potential as a talented rookie is there, but I would be hoping his usage increases to make him a flex value, rather than believing he can be a fantasy RB1.\n3\nHolding calls for TreVeyon Henderson. The Patriots promised he would get more touches, but when a rookie makes this many mistakes, it\u2019s hard to blame the coaches. Henderson came in as the perfect RB to avoid these types of issues, as he had no fumbles in college and was seen as a great pass-block"
