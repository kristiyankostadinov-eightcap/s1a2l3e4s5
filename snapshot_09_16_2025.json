                "body": "Here is what you need to know on Tuesday, September 16:\nThe US Dollar (USD) stays under modest bearish pressure early Tuesday as investors adjust their positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's critical two-day policy meeting. In the second half of the day, August Retail Sales, Import Price Index and Export Price Index data will be featured in the US economic calendar.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the weakest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nThe USD Index closed in negative territory on Monday, pressured by the improving risk mood in the American session. Wall Street's main indexes opened on a bullish noted and closed in positive territory. Early Tuesday, the USD Index continues to push lower and was last seen trading at its lowest level in over two months, slightly above 97.00. Meanwhile, US stock index futures trade mixed.\nThe UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported in the European morning that the ILO Unemployment Rate remained unchanged at 4.7% in the three months to July, as anticipated. In this period, annual wage inflation, as measured by the change in the Average Earnings Excluding Bonus, edged lower to 4.8% from 5% to match the market expectation. GBP/USD builds on Monday's gains and was last seen trading above 1.3620. The ONS will publish August inflation data on Wednesday.\nEUR/USD benefits from the broad-based USD weakness and rises toward 1.1800 in the European morning on Tuesday.

XAU/USD continues to push higher and trades at a new record-high above $3,680 in the European session on Tuesday.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a polic"

                "body": "Asia Market Wrap - Nikkei, Topix Hit Fresh Highs\nGlobal stocks are at an all-time high, and gold prices have reached a new record. This is happening as markets ramp up rate cut bets ahead of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday.\nThe MSCI All Country World Index, a measure of global stocks, has risen for 10 straight days\u2014its longest winning streak in over four years.\nOn the Japanese stock market, the two main indexes, the Nikkei 225 and the Topix, both reached all-time highs.\nMeanwhile, in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index saw a small gain of 0.08%. In mainland China, the CSI 300 index, which tracks top companies, experienced a slight decline of 0.38%.\nIn two separate events that largely went unnoticed by the markets, the U.S. Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, while a U.S. appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump could not fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nLooking at the market reaction, it appears as though these developments were considered unlikely to change the outcome of the Fed's decision on Wednesday, as a 25-basis-point interest rate cut is already fully anticipated by investors.\nUK Wage Growth Slows\nFrom May to July 2025, regular pay for workers in the UK, not including bonuses, increased by 4.8% compared to the year before. This marks the slowest rate of growth since May 2022 and was exactly what market experts had predicted. The slowdown was seen in both the public and private sectors.\nLooking at different industries, the fastest pay raises were in wholesale, retail, hotels, and restaurants, with a 6.4% increase. Other sectors saw more modest gains, including services (4.9%), manufacturing (4.5%), construction (3.9%), and finance and business services (3%). When adjusting for inflation, the real value of wages only went up by 0.7%, indicating that while people are earning more money, their purchasing power has seen a much smaller increase.\nSource: ING Think\nThe cooling job market is helping lower wage pressures which will be welcome by the Bank of England. This could aid the Bank of England in delivering another rate cut this year. Thursday may be unlikely, but another cut in Q4 remains a possibility.\nTomorrow's inflation data may prove to be more important as the service inflation conundrum persists for the BoE. A softer print could lead to increased expectations of a rate cut in Q4.\nEuropean Open - Stocks Retreat, Ferrari Up 2.6%\nEuropean stocks saw a slight decline on Tuesday, primarily due to a drop in the banking and insurance sectors, which are often sensitive to interest rate changes.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell by 0.15%, with both banking and insurance stocks losing approximately 1%.\nSeveral companies experienced notable individual stock movements. For example, shares in elevator maker Schindler dropped 1.7% after a major investor sold off a large block of shares at a discounted price. Meanwhile, French cosmetics giant L'Oreal saw its stock price fall by 2% following a downgrade from the financial firm Jefferies.\nIn contrast, luxury car maker Ferrari had a good day, with its shares climbing 2.6% after the firm Berenberg recommended buying the stock, citing the company's strong brand, pricing power, and consistent returns.\nOn the FX front, the U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday. It hit its lowest point in two and a half months against the euro and a ten-month low against the Australian dollar.\nThe dollar also weakened to a more than two-month low against the British pound, following renewed calls from US President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to aggressively lower interest rates.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against other major currencies, dropped to its lowest level since July 24. As the dollar weakened, other currencies rose. The euro gained against the dollar ahead of the release of some key economic data from Germany and Italy.\nThe British pound also strengthened, reaching its highest level against the dollar since early July, "
