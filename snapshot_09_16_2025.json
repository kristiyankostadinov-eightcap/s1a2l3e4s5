                "body": "Gold keeps hitting new highs. Here's why \u2014 and whether it's time to sell now\nGold prices are up more than 40% this year. Experts chime in on whether or not it's time to sell\nGold prices are surging right now, with the spot gold price per ounce at $3,656 as of September 15. Gold prices are up 41.8% for the year and up $1,600 since 2023.\nSuggested Reading\nWhat\u2019s more, Goldman Sachs says gold prices could rise to $5,000 if investors back off traditional safe-haven investments like U.S. Treasury bonds if the economy tilts toward recession. In this scenario, investors trust hard assets like gold over the U.S. dollar.\nRelated Content\n\u201cThe price target for gold for 2025 (end) is around $3750 if the interest rate is reduced,\u201d said Jose Gomez, co-founder at Salt Lake City-based Summit Metals. \u201cThe current price already reflects an interest rate reduction; however, if all things stay equal $3,750 is possible.\nWhy are gold prices climbing so quickly in 2025? Precious metals specialists point to multiple flash points.\nThe Federal Reserve and interest rates\nGood gold buying opportunities would continue if the Federal Reserve, as expected, curbs interest rates in the next few weeks.\n\u201cWe have seen this before in 2008, 2020, and even in August 2024,\u201d said Lina Thomas, an economic analyst at Goldman Sachs Research. \u201cTimes like these are good buying opportunities, because gold typically rebounds shortly afterwards as investors seek safe assets.\u201d\nSky-high government debt\nUncle Sam\u2019s debt burden is burgeoning, and that\u2019s sending shockwaves throughout the safe-haven assets markets.\n\u201cU.S. government fiscal and monetary policies, including massive U.S. deficit spending and unfathomable U.S. public debt and actuarial obligations for entitlements (such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans\u2019 benefits, etc.) will require the creation of more U.S. dollars to pay current promises and interest,\u201d said Thomas Winmill, portfolio manager at Midas Funds in Walpole, N.H.\nWinmill believes paying down meaningful amounts owed by the U.S. on its public debt is not feasible given the current budget deficit. \u201cThe continuous creation of U.S. dollars in this environment has and will continue to lead to a depreciated U.S. dollar, which causes U.S. price inflation and an increase in the price of all 'hard' assets, including gold,\u201d he noted.\nThere\u2019s a perfect storm of converging (and troublesome) economic trends\nGold has risen even though interest rates remain elevated, and has traditionally been correlated with real rates. However, this correlation has broken down this year, suggesting that something structural is shifting in capital allocation, reserve management, and risk perception, said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at Chicago-based Ninja Trader.\n\u201cThe U.S. dollar has weakened, making gold cheaper for foreign buyers and adding further momentum to the move,\u201d Shuchart said. \u201cPersistent inflation, which has been running above the Fed\u2019s target, also has reinforced gold\u2019s appeal as a long-term store of value.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to the story, as the surge in gold this year is likely the result of converging macroeconomic risks. \u201cThose risks include dollar dynamics, central bank buying, inflation worries, and an underlying suspicion that global financial architecture is being tested as rarely before,\u201d Shuchart said.\nAdditionally, central banks, especially in emerging economies, have also been ramping up their gold purchases as a strategic hedge against currency instability and debt concerns. \u201cThat steady accumulation has put real pressure on the supply side and has put an underlying bid in the gold market as they will buy at any price,\u201d Shuchart added.\nShould gold holders stay the course or sell at a profit?\nAny gold investor\u2019s exit strategy should be based on their portfolio\u2019s cost basis (i.e., the amount they paid for it) and the expected return on investment they targeted. \u201cOne should hold gold until it can be converted to the dollar, to then make another investme"

They also possess infrastructure to process, refine and distribute these goods around the world, supporting the energy supply chains.\nMentioned below are the 10 largest oil and gas loading terminals in the Middle East.\n1. Ras Laffan, Qatar\nThis port on the northeast coast of Qatar overlooks the Arabian Gulf and is the world\u2019s largest export facility for petrochemicals and hydrocarbons.\nIt lies within the Ras Laffan Industrial City and is strategically placed on the shipping route between the Far East and Europe.\nThe port spans 56 square kilometres and is designed to export LNG, LPG, condensates, petroleum products and sulphur, derived from the processing of gas extracted from the North Field Gas Reservoir.\nThere are 6 LNG berths, of which 4 can accommodate QMax ships with a 266,000 m3 capacity. The others can receive QFlex and conventional LNG carriers.\nAn additional 6 berths handle condensate, Pygas, GTL and refinery products. There is a sulphur berth and 6 berths for dry cargo, of which two also handle RORO.\n14 berths have facilities for offering bunkers and fresh water. They support ships involved in offshore exploration and production.\nTwo SPMs situated 54 km from the port can accommodate ships ranging from 85,000 to 320,000 DWT.\nAround 500 ships and 10,000,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this port.\n2. Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia\nSituated on Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern coast, Ras Tanura is the largest oil port in the world, handling 90% of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon exports and around 20% of the global consumption.\nIt can accommodate more than 2000 ships annually and load/unload 16 ships at once. It moves over 9 million barrels of hydrocarbons every day.\nIt has specialised terminals for crude oil, LPG, bunkering, etc.\nThe North Pier handles LPG, naphtha, crude oil, products and bunkers. It also includes 4 interconnected Sea Islands with berths for crude and fuel oil.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah Crude Terminal, 18 nm northwest of Ras Tanura, has an oil platform, a control platform, and 6 Single Point Mooring buoys for crude oil and bunkers.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah LPG Terminal has a two-berth pier for loading refrigerated liquefied petroleum gas (RLPG) onto LPG carriers.\nRas Tanura\u2019s storage capacity is more than 50 million barrels.\n3. Port of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates\nLocated 70 nm from the Strait of Hormuz, this is the world\u2019s second biggest hub for supplying fuel to vessels, serving over 12,000 each year.\nThe port operates 24/7 and has deep-water berths, bulk loaders, a large anchorage and houses the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone.\nEstablished in 1983, it is a key facility in the Middle East, handling exports and imports of crude oil, fuel products, and liquid bulk, supported by extensive storage facilities and the ADCOP pipeline.\nIt is a crucial maritime gateway to the Indian subcontinent, GCC countries and North Africa. Around 19,900,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this facility.\nApart from liquids, it also deals with dry bulk like aggregates, limestone, etc and general cargo, containers, and cruise vessels.\n4. The Al Ba\u015frah Oil Terminal (ABOT) & Khawr al \u2018Am\u012byah Oil Terminal (KAAOT), Iraq\nThese are Iraq\u2019s major offshore, deep-sea crude oil export facilities in the Persian Gulf, 50 km southeast of the Al-Faw Peninsula.\nThey are Iraq\u2019s sister terminals and function as the main platforms for exporting its crude oil. ABOT is a bigger facility with many berths, while KAAOT is comparatively smaller in size.\nAl-Basra Oil Terminal has a steel island structure with 4 berths, which can handle 4 tankers at once on 2 platforms, having a DWT of 35,000 to 350,000 tonnes.\nThe terminal\u2019s capacity exceeds 3.3 million bpd, and KAAOT has an export capacity of 400,000 bpd.\nBoth terminals are heavily guarded and are under the control of the Ir"

                "body": "The global average decline rate of oil and gas fields\u2019 production has accelerated sharply, driven by increased dependence on shale and deepwater resources, according to a report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This decline has forced companies to put in far greater effort to sustain current production levels.\nThe report showed that onshore supergiant oil fields in the Middle East see decline rates of under 2% annually, whereas smaller offshore fields in Europe lose over 15% of gas each year. Declines are even sharper for tight oil and shale gas, where production would drop by more than 35% in one year without investment, and a further 15% in a second year.\nIEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that just a small share of upstream oil and gas investment is allocated to supporting demand growth. On the other hand, almost 90% of annual spending is focused on replacing lost output from aging fields. \u201cDeclining production rates are often overlooked in conversations about oil and gas investment. Our latest analysis reveals that these declines have been speeding up in recent years,\u201d he added.\nBirol also highlighted the need for paying careful attention to impacts on market stability, energy security, and emissions.\n\u201cIn the case of oil, an absence of upstream investments would cause the loss of the equivalent of Brazil and Norway\u2019s combined production from the global market balance each year,\u201d Birol noted. To keep production at today\u2019s level, more than 45 million barrels per day (mmbl/d) of oil must be produced, along with about 200 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas from new fields by 2050, according to IEA\u2019s analysis.\nIn 2010, a freeze on upstream investments would have led to an annual loss of just under 4 mmbl/d of oil supply. Now, the figure has risen to 5.5 mmbl/d, with natural gas decline rates growing from 180 to 270 bcm per year, IEA explained.\nIn a recent report by the IEA, global oil production was predicted to increase to 105.8 mmbl/d throughout 2025, following the OPEC+ decision to ease back its earlier oil production cuts."

With the U.S. interest rate outlook more influential on the pair\u2019s recent movements than yield differentials or shifts in outright European yields, whether the Fed can meet or exceed dovish market pricing may determine whether a retest of the July highs sinks or swims.\nEUR/USD Tests Final Hurdle before July Highs\nHaving traded in a sideways range for more than a month following the release of the July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report at the start of August, the latest leg higher kicked off following a bounce from the intersection of the 50-day moving average and uptrend running from the August lows, delivering a bullish key reversal candle on the daily. The signal proved to be a reliable one, seeing EUR/USD push higher in the subsequent days, testing the July 24 high of 1.1788 in Asia on Tuesday.\nSource: TradingView\nThat\u2019s the first topside level of note, with a clean break above putting the pair on a potential collision course with the July high of 1.1832. Should EUR/USD fail at 1.1788, uptrend support is found at 1.1700 today. Considering the coiling pattern of recent weeks resembles a bear wedge, a break of the latter points to a possible deeper flush, putting the 50-day moving average, 1.1600 support, or even the July swing low in play.\nMomentum indicators favour upside over downside, with RSI (14) continuing to trend higher above 50, a bullish signal confirmed by MACD which has already staged a bullish crossover in positive territory. The message is one of building bullish momentum, improving the odds of topside breaks sticking.\nWhile the European calendar is relatively busy on Tuesday, most events screen as noise rather than signal when it comes to near-term directional risks. What\u2019s more important for EUR/USD is today\u2019s U.S. retail sales report and the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. With markets priced for the funds rate to bottom around 3% this cycle, it may require either the Fed to communicate a need to push rates into stimulatory territory\u2014which seems unlikely\u2014or a definitive signal from U.S. economic data that activity is rolling over, to spark a meaningful leg higher for the euro.\nStoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

The US Dollar (USD) could have a difficult time staging a decisive rebound ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting and help the pair hold its ground.\nEuro Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this week. Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nIn the absence of high-impact data releases, the improving risk mood caused the USD to lose interest on Monday. Additionally, Senate Republicans confirmed White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve Board. Miran, who is seen as a dove, will be able to vote at the upcoming meeting. This development also seems to be putting additional weight on the USD's shoulders.\nThe data from Germany showed on Tuesday that ZEW Survey - Current Situation Index dropped to -76.4 in September from -68.6, while the Economic Sentiment Index improved to 37.3 from 34.7. In the Eurozone, Industrial Production expanded by 0.3% on a monthly basis in July following the 0.6% contraction recorded in June. These prints failed to influence the Euro's performance in a noticeable way.\nLater in the day, the US Census Bureau will publish Retail Sales data for August. Although a stronger-than-forecast increase could support the USD with the immediate reaction, investors could refrain from betting on a steady recovery in the near term.\nMeanwhile, US stock index futures were last seen gaining between 0.1% and 0.35% on the day. In case risk flows continue to dominate the action in financial markets in the second half of the day, EUR/USD could continue to stretch higher.\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis\nEUR/USD trades near the upper limit of the ascending channel and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the 4-hour chart stays slightly above 70. In case the pair fails to flip 1.1800 (upper limit of the ascending channel) into resistance, technical buyers could be discouraged. In this scenario, 1.1770 (static level, former resistance) could be seen as the first support level before 1.1730 (50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), mid-point of the ascending channel) and 1.1690-1.1700 (100-period SMA, static level).\nOn the upside, 1.1830 (July 1 high) aligns as an interim resistance before EUR/USD could target 1.1900 (static level, round level).\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The "

Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%).

The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates.

Sterling has strung together three consecutive weekly gains, advancing from lows near 1.3150 in August to current levels, as traders shift focus to central bank policy meetings on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFed Rate Cut Bets Pressure the Dollar\nMarket pricing shows nearly a 100% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed\u2019s September 16\u201317 meeting, which would lower the federal funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%.

Inflation at 2.9% in August complicates the message, but Powell\u2019s remarks will be decisive. A dovish dot plot projecting rates closer to 3.00%\u20133.25% by end-2026 would confirm bearish momentum for the dollar, allowing GBP/USD to test the 1.3620\u20131.3650 resistance band.\nBank of England Steady as UK Budget Concerns Linger\nThe Bank of England meets on September 18, with markets widely expecting no policy change and the base rate to remain at 4.00%.

However, political and fiscal pressures are intensifying, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing scrutiny over a widening deficit and speculation of higher taxes in the November budget. The last vote split at the BoE was 5\u20134 in favor of a cut, underscoring a fragile consensus.

If the Fed signals an extended easing cycle, GBP/USD could push through 1.36 and retest 1.3788 highs, confirming a bullish breakout.

Miran will be the first executive-branch official to serve on the central bank\u2019s board since 1935.\n- The US Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, though there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Markets have also factored in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\n- Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. In separate notes on Friday, the brokerages projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\n- Traders are now expecting multiple Fed rate cuts after US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims climbed to their highest since October 2021, following last week\u2019s weak Nonfarm Payrolls report, overshadowing a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading.\n- The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday that China\u2019s Retail Sales rose 3.4% year-over-year (YoY) in August vs. 3.8% expected and 3.7% in July.

The move comes amid firm conviction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver a 25-basis-point (bps) interest rate cut at Wednesday\u2019s monetary policy meeting, a scenario markets now view as a done deal.\nAt the time of writing, AUD/USD trades near 0.6672, its strongest level in more than ten months. The pair has benefited from broad-based USD weakness, as traders fully price in imminent Fed easing. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering above eight-week lows around 97.30.\nFresh positioning data reinforced the shift in sentiment. The latest CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) report showed that net speculative short positions in AUD futures fell to around -79.2K contracts, compared with -82.7K previously. This marks the second straight week of reduced bearish exposure, driven partly by an uptick in long bets and short covering.\nMarket focus now turns to a heavy data calendar on both sides of the Pacific. In the US, Tuesday\u2019s Retail Sales will be pivotal in gauging consumer strength ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision.\nIn Australia, Thursday\u2019s employment report will be crucial for shaping Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy expectations. The central bank has flagged that the pace of any decline in the cash rate will largely be driven by labor market conditions, making this week\u2019s jobs data particularly sensitive for the currency.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Japanese Yen Talking Points:\n- USD/JPY has built into a hard range over the past six weeks, with the last attempted breakout on the July FOMC and BoJ rate decision snapped back after the NFP report.\n- EUR/JPY is nearing a major point of resistance while GBP/JPY is already testing a breakout above the 200.00 handle, both setups followed in these pieces and looked at in greater depth in the video below.\n- I\u2019ll be looking into all three markets in tomorrow\u2019s webinar and you\u2019re welcome to join. Click here to register.\nUSD/JPY remains in what\u2019s become a very consistent range and that\u2019s been the case since the first few days of August. Initially, USD/JPY broke out after the FOMC rate decision and that furthered on the BoJ rate decision in late-July. But the NFP report on the following Friday brought growth fears back around the US and USD/JPY was slammed back to support, which has held in the six weeks since.\nMaking matters there perhaps even more uninteresting is the fact that the range in USD/JPY has been just about 100 pips from recent support to resistance, which doesn\u2019t allow for much intra-day volatility, either.\nThe fact that the USD has been weak in many other major markets highlights the fact that USD/JPY is essentially marrying together two very weak currencies. And that weakness could be more attractive elsewhere, with either USD or JPY paired up with a currency like the Euro or British Pound. I\u2019ve been talking about this for some time now, including the late-July pullback. This is when EUR/JPY built support at the 170.00 handle, along with a higher-low, and GBP/JPY held support just four pips above the 195.00 level before bulls started to take-over again.\nThis week brings both the Fed and BoJ so there could be some motivation for trends, which I\u2019ll look at below.\nIn the major pair of USD/JPY, if we do see a Fed go slightly less dovish than what markets are looking for, there could be motive for topside, similar to what showed in July when Powell sounded not ready to cut rates. That led to a sizable breakout in USD/JPY that continued through the BoJ meeting and given how heavily rate cut expectations have priced-in to the US, it doesn\u2019t seem too low a bar for Powell to surprise to the upside.\nThat said, I think there\u2019s still the very real question in that scenario as to whether USD/JPY would be the most optimal pair to work with that Yen-weakness.\nUSD/JPY Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nAhead of the Fed and BoJ rate decision in July, we saw some fast position squaring in EUR/JPY. The pair quickly snapped back for a test of the 170.00 handle, which caught a rally around the BoJ meeting as the bank didn\u2019t sound ready to push more hawkish. But it\u2019s from that major move that a Fibonacci retracement was born that continues to hold value today.\nAs looked at last week, higher-low support held around the 172.30 level, and now we have a shorter-term test of support at prior resistance, between the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements.\nTaking a step back, there\u2019s now an ascending triangle formation in-play on the pair and that\u2019s a bullish breakout formation.\nAnd on the fundamental front, Christine Lagarde sounded less dovish at the ECB meeting last week, saying that \u2018the disinflationary process is over\u2019 and that the Eurozone economy is in a \u2018good place,\u2019 so if we do see the Fed push into a more dovish posture, that sets up divergence amongst the Central Banks which could justify greater Euro strength. I covered this in the article over the weekend in reference to EUR/USD, but it can similarly be adapted to EUR/JPY, as well.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nI\u2019ve favored GBP/JPY even over EUR/JPY, although that may shift this week after Lagarde\u2019s comments at ECB on Thursday. But, from a price action perspective the British Pound continues to lead the way as this morning ushered in a fresh yearly high on the pair.\nPerhap"

The pair closed at \u00a5147.66, after trading as high as \u00a5148.07 last week, showing the market\u2019s reluctance to break the range before this week\u2019s major central bank decisions.\nFed Policy Expectations Drive Correlation With USD/JPY\nMarket pricing shows four 25-basis-point cuts from the Federal Reserve by June 2026, totaling around 109 basis points. This expectation has tightened the negative correlation between rate cut pricing and USD/JPY to -0.87, meaning the pair moves almost inversely to Fed expectations. The Fed is widely expected to cut 25 bps this week, taking the funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%. If the dot plot signals a funds rate near 3.00\u20133.25% by end-2026, aligned with market pricing, USD/JPY may remain stable. However, a more aggressive six-cut outlook would likely push the yen higher, testing \u00a5146.00 and below.\nU.S. Economic Data and Labour Market Pressures\nThe U.S. economy is flashing signs of strain. Weekly jobless claims spiked to levels not seen in almost four years, while consumer sentiment dropped sharply according to the University of Michigan survey. Inflation, however, surprised to the upside at 2.9% year-on-year in August, complicating the Fed\u2019s messaging. Weakness in retail sales or further deterioration in the Empire State Manufacturing Index \u2014 expected to fall from 11.9 to 3 \u2014 could accelerate dovish bets, pushing USD/JPY lower toward \u00a5146.20, the 50-day EMA.\nBank of Japan Balances Dovish Tone Against Market Pressure\nThe Bank of Japan meets this week with its policy rate at 0.5%, and markets are pricing a 20% chance of a hike. Since lifting rates in July 2024 and again in January 2025, the BOJ has signaled a pause, but political uncertainty following Prime Minister Ishiba\u2019s resignation has weakened sentiment. Traders see around two hikes priced through mid-2026, but Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s dovish reputation keeps expectations muted. If his tone shifts hawkish, USD/JPY could drop rapidly below \u00a5146.00, while vague or cautious guidance would reinforce resistance at \u00a5149.00.\nSafe-Haven Yen Demand on Global Market Stress\nThe yen has found modest support from safe-haven demand amid Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign rating to AA-, raising fears of European debt contagion. This risk-sensitive backdrop lifted the yen to \u00a5147.39 earlier this week. However, broader flows show investors still favoring U.S. yields, keeping the yen capped. The correlation of USD/JPY with equity volatility has collapsed, meaning risk appetite has little impact compared to the rate differential story.\nRead More\n-\nIWY ETF Climbs to $270.12 Backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and AI Growth\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Trades Above $115K\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Prediction: HG=F Climbs to $4.60 as Supply Strain Meets Fed Policy Shift\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Holds 1.3585 With Fed and BoE in Spotlight\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY Levels\nOn charts, USD/JPY momentum indicators remain flat.

Investors seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path, while the US central bank will resume its rate-cutting cycle this week. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor driving flows towards the lower-yielding JPY and exerting downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nMeanwhile, the recent political developments in Japan could give the BoJ reasons to delay rate hikes. This, along with a positive risk tone, might keep a lid on any further appreciating move for the safe-haven JPY. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait for this week's key central bank events. The Fed is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Wednesday ahead of the two-day BoJ meeting starting Thursday, which will provide a fresh impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen is underpinned by BoJ rate hike bets, bearish USD\n- The Japanese Yen has been struggling for a firm near-term direction over the past week or so and oscillating in a range against its American counterpart amid ambiguity over the Bank of Japan rate hike decision. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation added a layer of uncertainty in the markets and could give the BoJ more reasons to go slow on interest rate hikes.\n- Japan's farm minister and the chief government spokesperson, Shinjiro Koizumi, on Tuesday announced his candidacy to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replace the outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.\n- Meanwhile, the US-Japan trade deal has removed some risks to domestic growth. The BoJ sees the development paving the way for steady progress toward the inflation target. Moreover, a tight labor market and optimistic economic outlook keep the door open for an imminent BoJ interest rate hike by the end of this year and offer some support to the JPY.\n- Moreover, the current market pricing points to a nearly two full 25-basis-point rate hikes by July next year, which, in turn, warrants some caution before placing aggressive JPY bearish bets. Traders might also opt to wait on the sidelines ahead of the latest BoJ monetary policy update on Friday. This, along with a bearish US Dollar, should cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near its lowest level since July 24 amid rising bets for a more aggressive policy easing by the US Federal Reserve. Traders ramped up their bets for three interest rate cuts by the Fed this year after the recent US macroeconomic data pointed to signs of a softening labor market.\n- The US Senate voted to confirm Stephen Miran \u2013 one of US President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisers \u2013 to join the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. Miran will now be voting on this week's interest rate decision. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who can participate in the pivotal two-day meeting starting Tuesday.\n- On the geopolitical front, Trump said on Monday that a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is difficult. This comes amid the intensifying Russia-Ukraine war and brewing Middle East tensions, which could further benefit the safe-haven JPY ahead of the key central bank events.\n- Tuesday's US economic docket features the release of US monthly Retail Sales figures and Industrial Production data later during the North American session. The immediate market reaction is more likely to be muted as traders might refrain"

The pair depreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could have received support from the improved Oil prices. WTI price received support after a potential supply disruption from Russia following Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure and mounting US pressure on buyers of Russian crude.\nMarkets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on Wednesday. Expectations for BoC easing have increased after data showed a loss of roughly 65,500 jobs in August and a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.1%. Traders will likely observe Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on Tuesday, which could influence the central bank\u2019s policy outlook.\nThe US Dollar (USD) depreciates against its peers as traders expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting due on Wednesday. However, there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut, with markets factoring in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\nTraders will also likely observe the Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the \u2018dot plot,\u2019 where each member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects the federal funds rate in the near future.\nMarkets are broadly expecting the Fed to deliver three straight 25 basis-point interest rate cuts through the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. Both brokerage firms projected on Friday a 25-basis-point rate reduction at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to"

The participation rate slid to 65.1%, its lowest since May 2021, while the unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% \u2013 the highest since August 2021.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Manufacturing Rebound Eases Pressure on BoC\nWith the 1-year OIS only pricing a 54% chance of another 25bp cut, market expectations are not overly dovish. The BoC could adopt a more cautious tone with this week\u2019s rate cut, particularly after the surprise rebound in manufacturing sales.\nManufacturing sales rose 2.5% in July to $70.3 billion, the fastest pace since January 2023. The transportation sector led the gains, with auto and aerospace sales rebounding strongly. Normally, July sees temporary shutdowns in Ontario auto plants, but closures were less severe this year. Combined with a 6.7% rise in auto exports, the data suggests manufacturers are adapting to Trump\u2019s tariffs, signalling that the worst disruptions may have passed.\nIf stronger inflation figures follow, money markets could fully price out expectations of further rate cuts, potentially boosting the Canadian dollar broadly.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Inflation Data Key for BoC and Loonie Direction\nAttention now shifts to today\u2019s inflation report. Headline CPI has slowed to 1.7% y/y, but core CPI remains at 2.6%, the upper end of the BoC\u2019s target band. Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation at 3.0% and median CPI at 3.1% remain uncomfortably high for doves.\nCounterintuitively, the Canadian dollar could weaken if trimmed mean and median CPI linger deeper into the 3% range, as that would raise stagflation concerns and revive expectations for further BoC cuts. Conversely, even a modest cooling in these measures could give the BoC breathing space to be more cautious with its dovish messaging, potentially lifting the Canadian dollar.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis\nWe\u2019re seeing early signs of a reversal in favour of Canadian dollar bulls, and I expect these moves to extend. It\u2019s still early days, but CAD is trading higher against all its major FX peers so far this week, building on mixed success against them late last week.\nGBP/CAD formed a notable bearish engulfing candle around the June high on Monday, snapping its 7-day rally. A similar bearish engulfing pattern appeared on EUR/CAD, hinting at a near-term cycle high. The mighty Australian dollar has also allowed AUD/CAD to retrace for a third straight day from its highest level since November 2023. CAD/JPY has risen for a third day as well, though my bias remains neutral for now. USD/CAD, however, has caught my attention, as it appears to have finally printed the swing high I anticipated last week.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Chart"

Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the 200.00 psychological mark as traders look forward to the UK employment details for a fresh impetus ahead of the key central bank events.\nThe UK jobs report, along with Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, could offer critical insight into the trajectory of inflation and its wider implications on monetary policy. A stronger-than-expected CPI print could further reduce the odds for an immediate interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), which is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday. This, in turn, could provide a goodish lift to the British Pound (GBP) and assist the GBP/JPY cross to attract some dip-buyers at lower levels.\nAhead of the key data, a broadly firmer Japanese Yen (JPY) exerts some downward pressure on spot prices. Despite domestic political turmoil, investors seem convinced that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor underpinning the JPY. That said, the uncertainty over the likely timing and the pace of rate hikes by the BoJ might cap gains for the JPY and help limit deeper losses for the GBP/JPY cross.\nFurthermore, the prevalent risk-on environment \u2013 as depicted by a generally positive mood around the equity markets \u2013 could offer some support to the currency pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the GBP/JPY cross has topped out in the near-term and positioning for any meaningful corrective decline.\n(The story was corrected on September 16 at 05:39 GMT, to say in the title, the third bullet point and the first paragraph that traders now look to UK jobs data, and not UK CPI.)\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards. It is the inflation measure used in the government\u2019s target. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Sep 17, 2025 06:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 3.9%\nPrevious: 3.8%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase of interest rates or the reduction of bond-buying by the BOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates looser monetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 200.50, up nearly 0.15% on the day, marking its highest level since July 24, 2024.\nThe British Pound is strong across the board at the start of the week, while the Yen remains on the defensive as traders position ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy decision on Thursday and the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) policy announcement on Friday.\nFrom a technical perspective, the cross continues to trade with a clear bullish bias, comfortably holding above both the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 199.23 and the 50-day SMA at 198.80. The sustained break and consolidation above the 200.00 psychological level reinforces the positive momentum, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62.7 pointing to strong upside pressure without reaching overbought territory.\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also reinforcing the bullish structure, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line and the histogram printing green bars. This crossover is a fresh bullish signal, suggesting that upside momentum is regaining strength after a period of consolidation.\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is located at the July 24, 2024 peak around 201.18, which if cleared would open the door toward the July 23, 2024 high at 203.16. A decisive break above this zone could pave the way for a broader extension of the uptrend.\nOn the downside, the first line of defense is the 200.00 psychological level, with additional support near the 21-day SMA, followed by the 50-day SMA. A break below these zones could trigger a deeper correction toward 197.50, though the broader structure remains constructive while price holds above 200.00.\nLooking ahead, UK labour market data on Tuesday and inflation figures on Wednesday will be closely watched for fresh cues on the BoE\u2019s policy stance, while in Japan, CPI figures due Friday ahead of the BoJ decision could provide additional volatility for the Yen.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "After the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, miners are facing harsh realities. The halving sharply reduced the rewards for new Bitcoin, resulting in a substantial decrease in mining revenues. This is happening at a time when electricity costs are on the rise, pushing the cost to generate a single Bitcoin to over $70,000. All this means that operational costs are outpacing earnings, especially for smaller mining operations that could see negative margins if the market doesn't bounce back soon.\nHow are miners managing the electricity price surge?\nIn light of soaring energy prices, miners are increasingly opting for renewable energy. Currently, more than 50% of Bitcoin mining operations derive their energy from facilities that produce renewable electricity, such as hydropower, wind, and solar. Many mines are being constructed in regions where such energy sources are plentiful, such as the Southwest U.S., Latin America, and Central Asia.\nWhat strategies are miners adopting to stay afloat?\nSmaller miners are pooling their resources to bolster their survival chances. By banding together in mining pools, they can combine their hashing power, which also helps to stabilize their income.\nNotably, these collaborations are not just limited to Bitcoin but also include staking and other blockchain services, offering them multiple revenue streams as Bitcoin mining income shrinks.\nWhat are the benefits of upgrading hardware?\nNewer, energy-efficient ASIC hardware is holding big promise for miners\u2019 profitability and prospects in the uncertain market. This equipment offers substantial energy savings and greater efficiency while addressing the rise in mining difficulty.\nThe future of Bitcoin mining appears to be leaning heavily towards renewable energy. It offers a potential solution to rising costs and a more sustainable path forward.\nWhy is renewable energy important in Bitcoin mining?\nRenewable electricity is becoming increasingly vital for Bitcoin mining. The shift to clean energy addresses both rising operation costs and the public\u2019s demand for sustainability. As these energy sources gain traction among miners, Bitcoin mining's carbon emissions are expected to decline.\nPolicymakers are aware of this shift, with incentives for renewable energy use and potential carbon taxes looming on the horizon. The immediate future of mining will increasingly rely on renewable energy to remain viable in a world where regulatory pressure is only expected to increase."

Each driver plays a critical role in enhancing Ethereum's utility, accessibility, and appeal to a widening demographic of users and institutions.\nLayer-2 networks are at the forefront of this transformation. As Ethereum's mainnet grapples with scalability challenges, L2 solutions like Arbitrum (ARBITRUM) and Optimism (OP) have emerged as vital conduits, offloading transaction processing from the main blockchain while maintaining its security. By reducing gas fees and speeding up transaction times, L2s are making the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly and economically viable for a broader range of applications and users. Industry experts, including VanEck, foresee a colossal $1 trillion collective market capitalization for Ethereum's Layer-2 protocols by 2030, a testament to their pivotal role in scaling the network and driving its adoption. This expansion is critical, ensuring that Ethereum can handle the increasing demand stemming from DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications without succumbing to network congestion or prohibitive costs.\nSimultaneously, the crypto world is witnessing an unprecedented influx of institutional interest, particularly in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking mechanism. The introduction of institutional-grade staking products and the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are monumental catalysts. These regulated investment vehicles provide traditional financial institutions and their clients with a secure and compliant pathway to gain exposure to ETH, which was previously a barrier for many. Analysts suggest that these ETFs will not only attract substantial capital but also effectively remove a significant amount of ETH from circulation as it gets staked, contributing to a potential supply squeeze. This institutional embrace, evidenced by major firms accumulating ETH at a pace exceeding retail demand, indicates a structural shift that could exert sustained upward pressure on Ethereum's price. Companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Fidelity (FNF) are among those expected to play a key role in facilitating this institutional adoption through their various staking and custodial services.\nFinally, the relentless expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity continues to cement Ethereum's dominance. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of the DeFi landscape, commanding the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) by a significant margin compared to other blockchains. This dominance means that the vast majority of innovative financial applications, from lending protocols to decentralized exchanges, operate on or are closely integrated with Ethereum. The thriving NFT market, too, predominantly relies on Ethereum, with iconic marketplaces like OpenSea and prominent colle"

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s journey towards the highly anticipated $5,000 level is taking the limelight, but a fresh DeFi altcoin is quietly receiving the spotlight. Mutuum Finance, one of the newest decentralized lending protocols in the market, is attracting growing interest among analysts who feel that its risk-sharing model and sustainable models for yields make it the standout choice in the current market cycle.\nThe token is currently underpriced at $0.035 during stage 6 of its presale. As Ethereum continues to maintain its momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a coin with increasingly strong bull run potential, which is again generating fresh discussion regarding where the smartest capital may be headed in the next several months.\nEthereum (ETH) is sitting at $4,437.37, with most of its recent sessions seeing it trade in the $4,300\u2013$4,500 area. Though hopes exist for ETH touching $5,000\u2013$5,500 later in 2025 if ETF demand picks up and volume returns, short-term momentum is also looking muted, resistance in the $4,500 area remaining an obstacle and certain technical indicators looking mixed. As ETH stabilizes, newer DeFi-oriented tokens are also on investors\u2019 radars, such as Mutuum Finance.\nMutuum Finance is providing investors with a chance to invest in the project when it is just at the initial phase of its development so that investors have the chance to buy the tokens at a very low cost. The token is being offered at one MUTM worth $0.035, while during the seventh token sale phase, the token will be offered at $0.04. Presale has been successful with over $15.63 million funds raised and token holders totaling over 16,240. Such demand positions MUTM on a strong footing compared to other DeFi protocols.\nThe latest news regarding the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is a bug bounty hunt where the participants will share a $50,000 USDT reward for finding any possible defect in its codebase. The project is already live and accessible to the masses. The developers have not only been engaged in building the platform but are also occupied with serving its users and investors.\nMutuum Finance relies on a two-tiered lending structure, a hybrid P2C and P2P lending structure with greater competitive advantage. With P2C, the smart contracts are walking the market round the clock to calculate interest payments, investors are investing at lower interest charges, and borrowers are lending at even lower cost of interest with investors earning their interest passively through the smart contracts. P2P facilitates borrowing and lending between the counterparties without an intermediary and thus a completely decentralized lending product and best suited for volatile or risky assets such as meme coins.\nFor enabling timely and accurate price information, Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles cross-referencing token prices with heavily traded securities such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and in-chain data are also utilized across the platform to provide up-to-date and precise price information. These protocols form the foundation of collateral pricing, risk management, and liquidation process, hence allowing the protocol to execute efficiently and be stable irrespective of the diverse conditions in the marketplace.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as Ethereum (ETH) aims to break to $5,000. Stage 6 presale tokens now sell at $0.035, and Stage 7 will move price to $0.04. The project has raised $15.63M and gained 16,240+ holders, a sign of high demand. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, double P2C/P2P lending protocol, and Chainlink-powered price discovery, MUTM unites security, innovation, and sustainable yield. With ETH staying steady at approximately $4,437, Mutuum Finance is an extremely leveraged DeFi trade. Lock in Stage 6 tokens now before the next price spike.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linkt"

In practice, that means a handful of large players are soaking up flows as smaller firms struggle to stay relevant.\nImitator bloat\nThat\u2019s compared to the nearly 200 publicly traded companies now racing to stack Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.\nTogether they hold more than 1 million Bitcoin worth around $116 billion \u2014 nearly 5% of the maximum supply.\nThe strategy was pioneered in 2020 by Michael Saylor\u2019s firm, Strategy, which issued low- or zero-interest debt and fresh stock offerings to buy more Bitcoin.\nAt the peak of the frenzy, Strategy traded at more than three times the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Today that premium has sunk to just 1.3x.\nJapan\u2019s Metaplanet and scores of others soon copied the playbook, crowding into a trade Standard Chartered now says is bloated with \u201ctoo many imitators.\u201d\nLate and hindered\nSolana treasuries are a fraction of the size of their Bitcoin and Ethereum peers.\nJust eight publicly traded firms hold a combined 6.5 million Solana, worth about $1.5 billion, according to data from tracker CoinGecko.\nAnd it may prove tricky for those firms to expand their holdings at the same rate that Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries are.\nStandard Chartered flagged that Nasdaq could soon require listed companies to obtain shareholder approval before making new crypto purchases, a step that risks slowing smaller or newer treasuries such as those holding Solana.\nEthereum treasuries, by contrast, already have pre-approved buying strategies in place, giving them a smoother path to keep accumulating.\nBoth Ethereum and Solana stand to benefit from the SEC\u2019s favourable shift on staking regulations, which opens the door to yield-generating products that Bitcoin can\u2019t match.\nKyle Baird is DL News\u2019 Weekend Editor.

HODL STKE (\"SOL Strategies\" or the \"Company\"), a publicly traded Canadian company focused on investing in and providing infrastructure for the Solana blockchain ecosystem, marks the one-year anniversary of its strategic transformation from a Bitcoin holding company to North America's first publicly traded enterprise dedicated to the Solana ecosystem. The transformation has delivered shareholder value while establishing new categories of institutional blockchain participation through the Company's DAT++ model.\n\"Twelve months ago, we didn't just pivot our strategy, we developed an entirely new business model within the digital asset treasury space,\u201d said CEO Leah Wald. \u201cOur DAT++ approach combines traditional treasury holdings with infrastructure-driven validator revenues, creating dual revenue engines that compound growth.

Even with the correction, SOL gained 24% in the past 30 days, supported by stronger onchain activity.\nTraders are now debating whether the current momentum could push SOL toward $300, especially as the Solana network has regained its lead in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\nIn September, Solana surpassed Ethereum to become the top blockchain for DEX trading. The network processed $121.8 billion in monthly volumes, about 90% higher than competitor BNB Chain. Securing leadership in this segment is key because higher volumes generate more fees, which creates recurring demand for SOL to pay for those transactions.\nAccording to Nansen data, fees on Solana rose 23% over the past seven days. The increase is notable given that Ethereum still has nearly seven times more total value locked (TVL). Yet ETH holders see limited benefits from that base since many decentralized applications, including restaking and real-world assets (RWA), show low turnover and weak fee generation.\nCorporate treasury allocations accelerate demand for SOL\nRecent corporate treasury activity has boosted demand for SOL. Some companies are raising capital through stock or debt offerings and allocating the proceeds to cryptocurrency. One example is Forward Industries (FORD), originally a medical and technology design firm, which raised $1.65 billion in private funding and used the proceeds to acquire SOL for its reserves.\nForward Industries was financed by Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Jump Crypto \u2014 both a market maker and venture capital fund \u2014 and Multicoin Capital, known for early bets on Helium (HNT), Filecoin (FIL), Solana, and Polkadot (DOT). Separately, a Solana-focused treasury firm called DeFi Development Corp disclosed holdings exceeding 2 million SOL, valued at more than $460 million.\nPantera Capital, another major blockchain asset manager, announced on Monday the launch of a new Solana-backed treasury vehicle, the Nasdaq-listed Helius (HSDT). The $500 million initial private placement was co-led by the Hong Kong-licensed fund manager Summer Capital and could expand to over $1 billion, according to the press release.\nRelated: Bitcoin and Solana ETPs lead $3.3B crypto inflow rebound: CoinShares\nAnother possible tailwind for SOL comes from a proposed open-source bridge between Solana and Base, an Ethereum layer-2 developed by Coinbase. Base has more than 20 million active addresses in 30 days, according to Nansen. The bridge would let users move assets across chains, creating what Base creator Jesse Pollak called a more \u201cinteroperable and connected\u201d ecosystem.\nThe Trump-backed crypto initiative World Liberty Financial (WLFI) also announced on Monday a partnership with Solana\u2019s memecoin platform Bonk.fun and the Raydium DEX to fund \u201cmultimillion-dollar promotional rewards.\u201d The effort targets USD1 stablecoin pairs, with WLFI\u2019s token reportedly backed entirely by US dollars and cash equivalents.\nConsidering Solana\u2019s expanding onchain activity, the accumulation of SOL by treasury-focused firms, and the visibility from the Base bridge and WLFI campaign, traders see conditions for further upside. A rally to $300 would give Solana a $163 billion market capitalization, still representing a 70% discount to Ether\u2019s $543 billion valuation, making the scenario plausible in the near term.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The recent rally surged the SOL price toward $250 resistance line before falling back below $235. Now the price has fallen to $230 as the bulls are trying to establish foothold above $230.\nFrom a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at 2.18, with the indicator showing rising selling pressure with recent candles. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) fell to 43.96, indicating that Solana faces strong resistance at the $250 mark and SOL needs to defend the $230 level to prevent a breakdown towards $212.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from Solana price analysis?\nThe Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $200.

However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $235, SOL may fall back to the $212 support continuing the consolidation.\nIs SOL a good investment?\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked (TVL).

Microsoft: Down 5%\nShares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) fell 5% last month because investors booked profits after the tech stock soared to all-time highs of $555.45 on July 31, and its market capitalization briefly surpassed $4 trillion for the first time ever.\nOn July 31, Microsoft posted 18% revenue and 24% net income growth for its fourth quarter, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Its cloud computing unit Azure logged the biggest revenue jump of 39% among all products. Microsoft projects double-digit growth in revenue and operating income for fiscal year 2026 (ending June 30, 2026).\n2. Caterpillar: Down 4%\nShares of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) hit all-time highs of $441.15 on July 31. But unlike Microsoft, Caterpillar's numbers sent the stock 4.3% lower in August.\nCaterpillar's second-quarter revenue declined 1%, and earnings per share slumped 16% year over year on unfavorable pricing. Although the construction and mining equipment giant expects higher revenue in 2025, it sees tariffs as a significant headwind to profitability. It projects free cash flow from its machinery, energy, and transportation businesses to be around $7.5 billion in 2025, versus $9.4 billion last year.\nAdvertisement\n3. International Business Machines: Down 3.8%\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) stock dropped sharply on July 24 after releasing Q2 numbers and continued to fall through August, losing 3.8% in the month. Ironically, IBM's revenue rose 8% year over year, and management now expects 2025 free cash flow to exceed its guidance of $13.5 billion, driven by growth in software.\nSoftware alone made up 43% of IBM's revenue in Q2.

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.\nTesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.\nAlphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.\nThe market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.\nStocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.\nThat\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.\nWhat\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nAnother threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.\nTrump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors from its board.\n\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network Monday, using his trademark all-caps style.\nOn Wall Street, Intel rose 2.9% after trimming its forecast for expenses this year. The move came after it completed the sale of a 51% stake in its Altera business to the Silver Lake investment firm.\nThat helped offset a 24.7% drop for Hain Celestial, which reported a larger loss for its latest quarter than it did a year earlier. Interim CEO Alison Lewis said the owner of \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d brands like Terra chips is making moves to stabilize sales \u201cas we recognize our performance has not met expectations.\u201d\nAlaska Air Group lost 6.7% after the airline said high fuel costs will likely cause its third-quarter results to come in at the low end of its forecasted range. It also cited higher expenses for overtime pay and passengers\u2019 compensation after bad weather and air-traffic control issues led to difficult operations in the summer, though it saw strong airfare trends thanks to demand for premium seats.\nNvidia edged down by less than 0.1% after China accused the chip company of violating its antimonopoly laws. Chinese regulators did not mention a punishment for Nvidia in a one-sentence statement on the matter but did say they would carry out \u201cfurther investigation.\u201d\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 30.99 points to 6,615.28.

It jumped to a record high of \u00a39.343, up by over 23% from its lowest level this week. This article highlights some of the top catalysts that may drive the Footsie Index this week.\nUK jobs, inflation, and retail sales data\nCopy link to sectionThe first main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer jobs numbers on Tuesday. Economists expect the upcoming jobs report to show that the economy added 158k jobs in the three months to July, much lower than the previous 238k.\nThey expect the data to reveal that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7%, while the average earnings rose by 4.8%.\nThe other main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer inflation data on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming data to reveal that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.9% in August from 3.8%, while the core CPI slowed to 3.7%.\nThese numbers will confirm that the UK is in a period of stagflation, which is characterized by a high inflation rate and slow economic growth. It is normally a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare because there is usually no good response mechanism.\nThe ONS will then publish the latest retail sales data on Friday. These numbers will provide more information about the health of the economy.\nBank of England interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision on Thursday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to take the UK inflation and jobs numbers into consideration when making these decisions.\nMost analysts see the bank leaving interest rates unchanged at 4% as cutting interest rates to boost the economy will likely have a negative effect on inflation.\nThere will be two key drivers for the FTSE 100 and sterling in this decision. First, they will react to a news on quantitative tightening in the UK, with analysts expecting the annual figure to be between \u00a3380 billion and \u00a3550 billion this year.\nSecond, the vote split will be watched closely as investors reflect on what to expect later this year. Market participants expect either one or no interest rate cuts this year.\nRead more: Bank of England cuts rates to 4% in historic split vote\nUK Gilt yields\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the performance of the UK bond market, commonly known as gilts.\nData shows that the 10-year yield has eased to 4.65%, while the 30-year one dropped to 5.48%, down from the year-to-date high of 5.75%.\nA hawkish Bank of England decision will likely lead to higher yields, which will likely impact the stock market. Historically, investors tend to move to the bond market when yields rise.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest decision on Wednesday.\nThis will be an important decision as it will be the first time that the central bank slashes interest rates this year.\nA Fed cut may positively impact American and global equities. However, the risk is that the interest rate cuts have already been priced in."

                "body": "European stock markets, led by a resurgent German DAX index, have delivered an unexpectedly strong performance in 2025, marking a significant turnaround from previous years. This robust growth, fueled by renewed investor confidence and strategic economic shifts, has seen key indices reach multi-year highs and even all-time records, positioning Europe as a compelling investment destination. The unexpected surge highlights a pivotal moment for the continent's financial landscape, promising potential ripple effects across various sectors and altering global investment flows.\nThe impressive gains signal a broader recalibration of investor perception towards European equities, driven by a confluence of attractive valuations, evolving monetary policies, and targeted fiscal stimuli. This performance not only defies earlier cautious forecasts but also underscores a growing conviction in the region's economic resilience and corporate profitability, setting the stage for a potentially transformative period for public companies and the wider European economy.\nA Continental Revival: What Happened and Why it Matters\nThe year 2025 has witnessed a remarkable resurgence across European stock markets, with the German DAX index taking center stage in this impressive rally. As of September 15, 2025, the DAX stood at an impressive 23,744 points, registering a substantial 27.43% increase over the past year. The index's year-to-date (YTD) return reached 20.88% by May and further climbed to 34.60% by early September, even touching an all-time high of 24,641.50 in July. This strong performance marks the first time in over two decades that European equities have significantly outperformed their U.S. counterparts, signaling a profound shift in global investment patterns.\nBeyond Germany, the optimism permeated broader European markets. The Morningstar Europe Index gained 6% in Q1 2025 and was up almost 11% YTD by May. The EURO STOXX 50 (STOXX: SX5E) surged 3.5% in February and saw a 10.81% increase in USD terms during Q1, reaching 5,426 points by mid-September and an all-time high of 5,568.65 in March. Similarly, the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX: SXXP) recorded its best start to a year since 2019 in absolute terms and its strongest relative start against the STOXX USA 500 since 2001. This collective ascent is not merely statistical; it signifies a pivotal moment where European markets are regaining investor trust and demonstrating robust fundamental strengths.\nSeveral factors have converged to propel this bullish trend. A crucial element has been the shift in investor sentiment, as evidenced by the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany, which rebounded sharply through mid-2025, reflecting growing optimism. Economically, Germany initiated a historic fiscal expansion, including a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund and increased defense spending, signaling a departure from its traditional fiscal conservatism. Simultaneously, the European Central Bank (ECB) began easing monetary policy with interest rate cuts, anticipated to stimulate the economy and corporate profitability. Furthermore, European stocks entered 2025 with attractive valuations compared to their US counterparts, drawing global investors seeking value and diversification.\nRobust corporate earnings throughout late 2024 and early 2025 also provided a significant impetus. Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 generally exceeded earnings expectations, and projections suggest that Europe's annualized profit growth could outpace the U.S. for the first time in over a decade. Geopolitical factors, such as hopes for de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict and increased defense spending across the EU, further stimulated economic activity and investor confidence. The relative underperformance of the US market in early 2025, driven by election uncertainty and trade tensions, also encouraged a reallocation of capital towards the more attractively valued European markets.\nNavigating the Boom: Winners Emerge Ac"

If we break down from here, the 23,250 level gets targeted as it is support. And therefore, I think we are trying to build up a little bit of momentum, but we are still very much in the same range that we have been in for some time.\nTop Forex Brokers\nUltimately, if we break down below the 23,000 level, then that's a very negative sign, but right now, I don't see that quite yet. The ECB has decided to sit still with its interest rates, and it suggested that it was very data dependent. So, I think we've got a situation where traders are going to be paying close attention to all the German economic numbers to get an idea as to how the German economy is functioning as per usual, but they will also take everything into account around the continent to see what the ECB might do.\nWatch ALL of Europe\nSo really poor French numbers, for example, might be a backdoor way to get an idea as to how the DAX might move. Ultimately, this is a market that remains somewhat sideways overall, but I think you've got a situation where traders are likely to continue to see more of a buy on the dip attitude, unless of course we break down below the 200 day EMA and then from a longer term standpoint you are technically in a downtrend. That being said, it is worth noting the buyers step back in to at least somewhat pick up the market later in the day.\nReady to trade our stock market forecast and analysis?

The move has put Miran in place just in time to cast a crucial vote on the direction of interest rates.\nThough Miran has said he would act independently, his intention to take a leave of absence \u2014 but not resign \u2014 from his current role as a White House advisor has raised questions about the future of Fed independence, especially as Trump pursues firing Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n(NQ=F)\nIn day trading Monday, stocks rose, lifting the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to new record highs. Ongoing US-China trade talks in Madrid and anticipation Fed officials will announce a rate cut at its next meeting boosted sentiment.\nIn an otherwise light week on economic data, on Tuesday, investors will receive the latest figures on retail sales. The update will offer insight into how consumers are faring amid sticky inflation and a wobbly labor market.\nTesla (TSLA) stock rose 2% on Tuesday in premarket trading after wiping out its year-to-date losses on Monday following CEO Elon Musk purchased shares of the EV maker for the first time since 2020.\nThe main event of the week lands Wednesday when the Fed will announce its decision on rates. Markets are confident policymakers will cut rates due to a slowdown in the labor market, despite persistently high prices. Traders currently see a 96% chance of a 25 basis-point cut and a 4% chance of a jumbo reduction.\nOn Friday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to discuss trade and a new framework for a TikTok deal.\nLIVE 4 updates"

                "body": "The Trump administration released its latest report Tuesday on how to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d the second installment of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s strategy to combat chronic disease among children. While this report amplified calls to address long-standing environmental and behavioral practices that harm kids, experts said it was slim on details about how to turn policy priorities into regulatory action. They also worried about a disconnect between what this report says and how the Trump administration has unraveled research that would address these issues.\nSince the Senate confirmed him in February, Kennedy has promoted the concept and use of what he calls \u201cgold-standard science\u201d to expose the causes of child health outcomes, a phrase he repeated today when speaking about how the commission behind the report would proceed with development rules and recommendations.\nBut health and environmental experts who spoke to PBS News said his actions speak louder than words; research has shown that actions like the administration\u2019s push to shred health and environmental regulations could contribute to worsening, not improving, the outcomes and wellbeing of children.\n\u201cSecretary Kennedy has correctly identified chronic disease as a major driver of poor health and high healthcare costs,\u201d said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a written statement. \u201cBut neither his record as health secretary nor most of the policies outlined in this report inspire confidence that he is the right person to solve this problem.\u201d\nThe much-anticipated report was brief, fewer than 20 written pages filled with bullet points highlighting several policy priorities that Kennedy and the Trump administration have already touted or acted on in recent months.\n\u201cA lot of these 128 recommendations are things I\u2019ve been dreaming about my whole life,\u201d Kennedy said Tuesday at a press conference.\nMarc Weisskopf, a professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, told PBS News that he was particularly heartened to see that the Trump administration says it is paying attention to the role that a lack of physical activity, access to nutritious foods and environmental factors can shape children\u2019s health outcomes.\nBut he also pointed to the disconnect between what this report says and how the Trump administration has unraveled research to better understand these issues and regulations designed to address them.\nIf the goal is to deliver \u201cgold-standard science\u201d and to protect children\u2019s health, Weisskopf said, \u201cWe need people who are knowledgeable about this work to be around the table.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the issues the latest report seeks to address, and some important factors experts say were overlooked:\nTargeting poor diet, additives and fluoride\nIn the same report where the administration slammed lax standards on food and linked them to deteriorated health outcomes, the Trump administration called for deregulation of agriculture and food.\nEmphasizing the need for revamped dietary guidelines, the report called for changes in committees and task forces that advise the federal government about these standards. The report slammed the availability of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d and the use of artificial food dyes, building on Kennedy\u2019s previously announced plans to phase out certain dyes in April. The administration pledged to increase testing for heavy metals like lead in infant formula, and look for ways to boost breastfeeding rates nationwide.\nThe report also re-upped Kennedy\u2019s campaign against fluoride, stating that the CDC would update recommendations for fluoride and PFAS in drinking water. Public health experts have celebrated fluoride as one of the great innovations in cavity prevention and improved dental health.\nThe National Institutes of Health will link health insurance claims informatio"

                "body": "Fantasy Football: Brian Thomas Jr.'s worrisome start has a silver lining, and 9 other stats from Week 2 that stood out\nEach Monday, fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth will go over 10 important stats that you may have overlooked from Sunday. With so much going on, what keys to fantasy success are dug up that the masses may miss?\n35.7%\nBrian Thomas Jr\u2019s target share after Jarrian Jones left the game. Jones is a starting CB for Jacksonville, which, in most cases, usually doesn\u2019t affect fantasy stock when an injury happens to your own team\u2019s corner. However, in this case, it is notable that Travis Hunter started playing a majority of the Jaguars\u2019 defensive snaps due to the injury.\nCall me crazy, but I\u2019m not completely out on Thomas after the first couple of weeks. Twelve targets, two end-zone targets and 258 air yards in Week 2 is as good of volume as it gets.\nThe result wasn\u2019t pretty, but it wasn\u2019t for the same reason as Week 1. Last week, Trevor Lawrence only delivered three catchable targets to Thomas, whereas this week, plays were available to be made but just came up short in big moments.\nThe chemistry and on-field communication need improvement. The talent is there, though, and the Jaguars are still adapting to a fresh offense. Although on the surface it doesn\u2019t look like it, I believe Game 2 was a step in the right direction.\n9.5%\nMark Andrews targets per route this season. Bad. It\u2019s hard to find the silver lining when the excuses are no longer there. Andrews is healthy, running plenty of routes and is playing without TE2 Isaiah Likely. Andrews' route percentage increased from a very low 59% in 2024 to his old regular 76% in 2025.\nPart of it comes from natural TD regression. He scored nine touchdowns on nine end-zone targets last year, so already not scoring on his end-zone target Sunday is somewhat expected. But it\u2019s much more than that. He has been completely limited to a safety option rather than a downfield target.\nThrough two games, his air yards sit at 10. Ten air yards. Most players get that on a single target.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this bad for the entire season, but with Likely returning and Andrews being ultra-TD-dependent, I\u2019ll look elsewhere at the position in fantasy.\n[Upgrade to Fantasy Plus and gain your edge in player projections and much more]\n55.5%\nBhayshul Tuten\u2019s touches per snap. Not all backup running backs are the same. Some, say LeQuint Allen Jr., are on the field to give the starter a breather, maybe have a pass-blocking role or take the 3rd & 15 carries. That is NOT Bhayshul Tuten. He only played 25.7% of snaps in the first game without RB Tank Bigsby, but when he was on the field, he was the focal point of the offense.\nHe wasn\u2019t just giving Travis Etienne Jr. a breather. He played in the red zone at points, got a designed screen and started the second drive of the game. The point? His usage was not an accident. I by no means think Etienne is done for, but I do believe Tuten\u2019s role will only grow from here.\n100%\nQuinshon Judkins plays with a route or carry. Another rookie as the focal point. Judkins was very similar to Tuten, playing only 18 snaps, where on the eight passing plays in which he wasn\u2019t given the rushing attempt, he ran 100% of routes and was targeted three times. He led the team in touches despite Jerome Ford playing two times the RB snaps.\nRookie RB Dylan Sampson looks to be no more than a backup as he saw half the amount of Judkins\u2019 touches on the same amount of snaps. Judkins should lead the committee RB room in a shaky offense. The upside potential as a talented rookie is there, but I would be hoping his usage increases to make him a flex value, rather than believing he can be a fantasy RB1.\n3\nHolding calls for TreVeyon Henderson. The Patriots promised he would get more touches, but when a rookie makes this many mistakes, it\u2019s hard to blame the coaches. Henderson came in as the perfect RB to avoid these types of issues, as he had no fumbles in college and was seen as a great pass-block"

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)\nCiting \u201cmultiple reports of deeply troubling\u201d comments made by teachers and school personnel concerning the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson on Friday advised school districts to investigate educators making such comments and refer them to the Virginia Board of Education for licensure revocation.\nSocial media comments concerning Kirk\u2019s death have proliferated in Virginia, including remarks by school system workers in Accomack, Chesterfield, and Orange counties and the city of Newport News that have stoked controversy.\n22-year-old Utah man in custody suspected of killing Charlie Kirk\nOn Sunday, Axios Richmond reported that Chesterfield County School Board member Dorothy Heffron announced she would resign at the end of her term on December 31, following her widely criticized social media post that drew condemnation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is also running for governor, and other leaders.\n\u201cCall me old fashioned, but I remember when we used to be okay with shooting Nazis,\u201d Heffron wrote on Instagram. Her account has since been deleted.\n\u201cParents entrust our educators with the care and development of their children, and they rightly expect teachers and school leaders to model the values of respect, civility, and responsibility,\u201d said Gullickson in a statement. \u201cAnyone who would suggest the heinous murder of the father of two young children is acceptable should be disqualified from teaching or working with children again.\u201d\nHeffron\u2019s remarks struck a nerve among Republicans including Youngkin and. Earle-Sears, who claimed on Sept. 14 that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger had not responded to the tragedy or social media remarks.\nSpanberger shared a statement with Richmond TV news station WWBT on Sept. 12 condemning political violence.\n\u201cAs the investigation continues and law enforcement continues to build their case, I think it\u2019s important to state unequivocally: I condemn any efforts to justify or minimize the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk or anyone else,\u201d Spanberger wrote.\nThe Virginia Education Association (VEA), the largest union for teachers and support specialists, questioned the superintendent\u2019s response when, according to VEA President Carol Bauer, their members face harassment through various forms.\n\u201cThis is a little bit of political overreach. I certainly agree that educators should model professionalism. We really cannot support a blanket condemnation that fails to distinguish between private personal expression and professional conduct,\u201d Bauer said to 13News Now.\nHowever, Bauer said the association \u201cstands ready\u201d to support its members \u201cwhose due process rights have been violated in this climate.\u201d\nIn Virginia, multiple cases have arisen regarding remarks about the death of the 31-year-old, who was a husband and father of two young children.\nOne case involving an unnamed staff member at Newport News Public Schools was suspended after reportedly stating, \u201cI hope he suffered through all of it,\u201d in reference to Kirk.\nA staff member of Accomack County Public Schools is also under investigation for a comment posted on social media, according to Superintendent Gennifer Miller. Republicans including Earle-Sears have also highlighted another Central Virginia teacher\u2019s comments about Kirk.\nDel.
