Experts chime in on whether or not it's time to sell\nGold prices are surging right now, with the spot gold price per ounce at $3,656 as of September 15. Gold prices are up 41.8% for the year and up $1,600 since 2023.\nSuggested Reading\nWhat\u2019s more, Goldman Sachs says gold prices could rise to $5,000 if investors back off traditional safe-haven investments like U.S. Treasury bonds if the economy tilts toward recession. In this scenario, investors trust hard assets like gold over the U.S. dollar.\nRelated Content\n\u201cThe price target for gold for 2025 (end) is around $3750 if the interest rate is reduced,\u201d said Jose Gomez, co-founder at Salt Lake City-based Summit Metals. \u201cThe current price already reflects an interest rate reduction; however, if all things stay equal $3,750 is possible.\nWhy are gold prices climbing so quickly in 2025? Precious metals specialists point to multiple flash points.\nThe Federal Reserve and interest rates\nGood gold buying opportunities would continue if the Federal Reserve, as expected, curbs interest rates in the next few weeks.\n\u201cWe have seen this before in 2008, 2020, and even in August 2024,\u201d said Lina Thomas, an economic analyst at Goldman Sachs Research. \u201cTimes like these are good buying opportunities, because gold typically rebounds shortly afterwards as investors seek safe assets.\u201d\nSky-high government debt\nUncle Sam\u2019s debt burden is burgeoning, and that\u2019s sending shockwaves throughout the safe-haven assets markets.\n\u201cU.S. government fiscal and monetary policies, including massive U.S. deficit spending and unfathomable U.S. public debt and actuarial obligations for entitlements (such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans\u2019 benefits, etc.) will require the creation of more U.S. dollars to pay current promises and interest,\u201d said Thomas Winmill, portfolio manager at Midas Funds in Walpole, N.H.\nWinmill believes paying down meaningful amounts owed by the U.S. on its public debt is not feasible given the current budget deficit. \u201cThe continuous creation of U.S. dollars in this environment has and will continue to lead to a depreciated U.S. dollar, which causes U.S. price inflation and an increase in the price of all 'hard' assets, including gold,\u201d he noted.\nThere\u2019s a perfect storm of converging (and troublesome) economic trends\nGold has risen even though interest rates remain elevated, and has traditionally been correlated with real rates. However, this correlation has broken down this year, suggesting that something structural is shifting in capital allocation, reserve management, and risk perception, said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at Chicago-based Ninja Trader.\n\u201cThe U.S. dollar has weakened, making gold cheaper for foreign buyers and adding further momentum to the move,\u201d Shuchart said. \u201cPersistent inflation, which has been running above the Fed\u2019s target, also has reinforced gold\u2019s appeal as a long-term store of value.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to the story, as the surge in gold this year is likely the result of converging macroeconomic risks. \u201cThose risks include dollar dynamics, central bank buying, inflation worries, and an underlying suspicion that global financial architecture is being tested as rarely before,\u201d Shuchart said.\nAdditionally, central banks, especially in emerging economies, have also been ramping up their gold purchases as a strategic hedge against currency instability and debt concerns. \u201cThat steady accumulation has put real pressure on the supply side and has put an underlying bid in the gold market as they will buy at any price,\u201d Shuchart added.\nShould gold holders stay the course or sell at a profit?\nAny gold investor\u2019s exit strategy should be based on their portfolio\u2019s cost basis (i.e., the amount they paid for it) and the expected return on investment they targeted. \u201cOne should hold gold until it can be converted to the dollar, to then make another investme"

They also possess infrastructure to process, refine and distribute these goods around the world, supporting the energy supply chains.\nMentioned below are the 10 largest oil and gas loading terminals in the Middle East.\n1. Ras Laffan, Qatar\nThis port on the northeast coast of Qatar overlooks the Arabian Gulf and is the world\u2019s largest export facility for petrochemicals and hydrocarbons.\nIt lies within the Ras Laffan Industrial City and is strategically placed on the shipping route between the Far East and Europe.\nThe port spans 56 square kilometres and is designed to export LNG, LPG, condensates, petroleum products and sulphur, derived from the processing of gas extracted from the North Field Gas Reservoir.\nThere are 6 LNG berths, of which 4 can accommodate QMax ships with a 266,000 m3 capacity. The others can receive QFlex and conventional LNG carriers.\nAn additional 6 berths handle condensate, Pygas, GTL and refinery products. There is a sulphur berth and 6 berths for dry cargo, of which two also handle RORO.\n14 berths have facilities for offering bunkers and fresh water. They support ships involved in offshore exploration and production.\nTwo SPMs situated 54 km from the port can accommodate ships ranging from 85,000 to 320,000 DWT.\nAround 500 ships and 10,000,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this port.\n2. Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia\nSituated on Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern coast, Ras Tanura is the largest oil port in the world, handling 90% of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon exports and around 20% of the global consumption.\nIt can accommodate more than 2000 ships annually and load/unload 16 ships at once. It moves over 9 million barrels of hydrocarbons every day.\nIt has specialised terminals for crude oil, LPG, bunkering, etc.\nThe North Pier handles LPG, naphtha, crude oil, products and bunkers. It also includes 4 interconnected Sea Islands with berths for crude and fuel oil.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah Crude Terminal, 18 nm northwest of Ras Tanura, has an oil platform, a control platform, and 6 Single Point Mooring buoys for crude oil and bunkers.\nThe Ju\u2019aymah LPG Terminal has a two-berth pier for loading refrigerated liquefied petroleum gas (RLPG) onto LPG carriers.\nRas Tanura\u2019s storage capacity is more than 50 million barrels.\n3. Port of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates\nLocated 70 nm from the Strait of Hormuz, this is the world\u2019s second biggest hub for supplying fuel to vessels, serving over 12,000 each year.\nThe port operates 24/7 and has deep-water berths, bulk loaders, a large anchorage and houses the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone.\nEstablished in 1983, it is a key facility in the Middle East, handling exports and imports of crude oil, fuel products, and liquid bulk, supported by extensive storage facilities and the ADCOP pipeline.\nIt is a crucial maritime gateway to the Indian subcontinent, GCC countries and North Africa. Around 19,900,000 tonnes of cargo are handled annually at this facility.\nApart from liquids, it also deals with dry bulk like aggregates, limestone, etc and general cargo, containers, and cruise vessels.\n4. The Al Ba\u015frah Oil Terminal (ABOT) & Khawr al \u2018Am\u012byah Oil Terminal (KAAOT), Iraq\nThese are Iraq\u2019s major offshore, deep-sea crude oil export facilities in the Persian Gulf, 50 km southeast of the Al-Faw Peninsula.\nThey are Iraq\u2019s sister terminals and function as the main platforms for exporting its crude oil. ABOT is a bigger facility with many berths, while KAAOT is comparatively smaller in size.\nAl-Basra Oil Terminal has a steel island structure with 4 berths, which can handle 4 tankers at once on 2 platforms, having a DWT of 35,000 to 350,000 tonnes.\nThe terminal\u2019s capacity exceeds 3.3 million bpd, and KAAOT has an export capacity of 400,000 bpd.\nBoth terminals are heavily guarded and are under the control of the Ir"

                "body": "IEA: Oil & gas decline rates sound the alarm over global energy security risks\nGiven the accelerated decline in hydrocarbon production rates, a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned about the supply risks that output drops carry, as ignoring them has the potential to undermine energy security, market stability, and emissions reduction aspirations, with a global energy shortfall as a potential outcome.\nWhile calling for a shift in global energy discourse to balance supply-side risks with demand-side trends, the IEA\u2019s \u2018Implications of Oil and Gas Field Decline Rates\u2019 report points out that ignoring the fall in production volumes, which has significantly accelerated globally, largely due to higher reliance on shale and deep offshore resources, represents a threat to global markets and energy security.\nLocations of approximately 230 billion barrels of oil and 40 trillion cubic metres (tcm) of gas resources, which are discovered but not yet approved for development, show the largest volumes in the Middle East, Eurasia, and Africa. The IEA\u2019s calculations indicate an addition of around 28 million barrels per day (mb/d) and 1,300 billion cubic meters (bcm) to the supply balance by 2050, if these resources are developed.\nRelated Article\nThis report indicates the need for more upstream investments, since without new fields, oil supply by 2050 could fall by 45 million barrels a day. As a result, a lack of continued investment in these fields would mean the world would lose the equivalent of Brazil and Norway\u2019s combined production from the global oil balance each year.\nOn the other hand, natural gas production would decrease by an average of 9%, or 270 bcm, each year, which is equivalent to total natural gas production from the whole of Africa today, according to the IEA\u2019s analysis.\nThe new report, which draws on production data from around 15,000 oil and gas fields from around the world, shows that decline rates vary widely across field types and geographies, with onshore supergiant oil fields in the Middle East declining at less than 2% per year, while smaller offshore fields in Europe average more than 15% per year.\nThe analysis highlights that tight oil and shale gas tend to decline even more steeply, with output decreasing by more than 35% over one year and a further 15% over a second year without further investment.\nThe International Energy Agency outlined: \u201cNearly 90% of annual upstream oil and gas investment since 2019 has been dedicated to offsetting production declines rather than to meet demand growth. Investment in 2025 is set to be around USD 570 billion, and if this persists, modest production growth could continue in the future.\n\u201cBut a relatively small drop in upstream investment can mean the difference between oil and gas supply growth and static production. At the same time, less investment is required in a scenario in which demand contracts.\u201d\nWhile a halt in upstream investment would have cut oil supply by just under 4 million barrels per day each year in 2010, the equivalent figure is 5.5 mb/d now, while natural gas decline rates have risen from 180 billion cubic meters per year to 270 bcm.\nThe International Energy Agency underscored: \u201cUnder natural decline rates, global oil and gas supply would become much more concentrated among a small number of countries in the Middle East and Russia, with implications for energy security.\n\u201cMost oil production in the United States comes from fast declining unconventional sources, while in the Middle East and Russia most oil is produced from slowly declining conventional supergiant fields. Absent further capital investment, advanced economies would face rapid production declines \u2013 a 65% drop over the next decade \u2013 while declines would be shallower in the Middle East and Russia (45%).\u201d\nBased on the report\u2019s findings, it has taken almost 20 years on average to move from issuing an exploration license for oil and gas until first production, including nearly a "

                "body": "The EUR/USD has come off its highs on the back of a stronger retail sales report from the US than expected. But it remains to be seen whether the stronger data will ignite a dollar rally, when tomorrow the Fed is about to deliver the first of probably three rate cuts before the end of 2025. At the same time, the ECB is most likely done with its rate cuts. This should result in narrowing of yield differentials between the US and Eurozone bonds. At the same time, much of the dollar selling may already be done. So, the EUR/USD upside may be capped but the downside risks are currently low. Thus, I continue to think we will see $1.20 handle soon, meaning my EUR/USD forecast remains bullish.\nUS retail sales surprise, but does it matter?\nRetail sales rose 0.6% on the headline front and 0.7% on the core front in August, both higher than expected. But does it matter? Well, the data suggests it is not all doom and gloom out there, but this is probably too little too late to prevent a rate cut tomorrow. The Fed has clearly signalled it will trim rates and everyone expects them to do so. But the recent dollar selling was never about this week\u2019s likely rate cut. It was all about whether we will get one or two more cuts before the year is out. Well, the jury is still out on that, as surely one retail sales report is unlikely to sway the Fed in one or the other direction.\nSo, from a rate cut perspective, traders may take the retail sales beat in their stride and continue to buy dips in foreign currencies.\nEUR/USD forecast: $1.20 still on bulls\u2019 radars\nEarlier today, the dollar was sliding towards its weakest level since July, with the euro climbing 0.5% and brushing against highs last seen in 2021. The policy divergence here is stark \u2014 the Fed looks ready to cut into 2026, while the ECB has more or less shut the door on fresh easing. For euro bulls, that\u2019s a recipe for momentum, though I\u2019d caution against assuming Europe\u2019s fundamentals are anywhere near robust, though we had a stronger ZEW survey from Germany this morning to suggest investor sentiment is improving towards the Eurozone's largest economy.\nWith the ECB not seen cutting again soon, and the Fed potentially about to start another cutting cycle, this should provide a positive backdrop for the euro, lifting the pair to the summer highs of above 1.1830 in the coming days. So, I still see the EUR/USD potentially reaching for $1.20 in the coming days.\nEUR/USD key levels to watch\nOn the EUR/USD daily chart, support is now seen around 1.1780 initially ahead of the 1.1700 handle next. First line of resistance now comes in at 1.1830, marking the July high. It is possible we could see a false break or double top there, or at least a temporary top before the market resumes higher. Thereafter, I don\u2019t see much resistance until the psychologically important 1.20 handle. I would only drop my technically bullish EUR/USD forecast should rates break the current structure of higher highs and higher lows. Thus, a small pullback will not necessarily signal the end of the bull trend.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R"

Whether the rally extends now rests with the Fed, with markets watching if policymakers validate dovish pricing or push back.\n- EUR/USD nears July highs\n- Momentum signals bullish bias\n- Fed decision key for direction\nEUR/USD is now within touching distance of setting fresh multi-year highs, continuing to grind higher ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision later in the week. With the U.S. interest rate outlook more influential on the pair\u2019s recent movements than yield differentials or shifts in outright European yields, whether the Fed can meet or exceed dovish market pricing may determine whether a retest of the July highs sinks or swims.\nEUR/USD Tests Final Hurdle before July Highs\nHaving traded in a sideways range for more than a month following the release of the July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report at the start of August, the latest leg higher kicked off following a bounce from the intersection of the 50-day moving average and uptrend running from the August lows, delivering a bullish key reversal candle on the daily.\nThe signal proved to be a reliable one, seeing EUR/USD push higher in the subsequent days, testing the July 24 high of 1.1788 in Asia on Tuesday.\nSource: TradingView\nThat\u2019s the first topside level of note, with a clean break above putting the pair on a potential collision course with the July high of 1.1832. Should EUR/USD fail at 1.1788, uptrend support is found at 1.1700 today. Considering the coiling pattern of recent weeks resembles a bear wedge, a break of the latter points to a possible deeper flush, putting the 50-day moving average, 1.1600 support, or even the July swing low in play.\nMomentum indicators favour upside over downside, with RSI (14) continuing to trend higher above 50, a bullish signal confirmed by MACD which has already staged a bullish crossover in positive territory. The message is one of building bullish momentum, improving the odds of topside breaks sticking.\nWhile the European calendar is relatively busy on Tuesday, most events screen as noise rather than signal when it comes to near-term directional risks. What\u2019s more important for EUR/USD is today\u2019s U.S. retail sales report and the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday.\nWith markets priced for the funds rate to bottom around 3% this cycle, it may require either the Fed to communicate a need to push rates into stimulatory territory\u2014which seems unlikely\u2014or a definitive signal from U.S. economic data that activity is rolling over, to spark a meaningful leg higher for the euro.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\nThat's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.\nFor example, the Piotroski's Picks method averages 23% annual returns by focusing on financial strength, and you can get it as a standalone screen.

                "body": "The euro is gaining momentum against the U.S. dollar as traders price in widening policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. EUR/USD has surged nearly 14% in 2025, breaking above a multi-year consolidation band between 1.0500 and 1.1000 and now holding near 1.1700. With technicals and fundamentals aligned, a move toward the psychologically important 1.2000 level \u2014 last seen in 2021 \u2014 is increasingly likely.\nRichmond Lee, CFA and Senior Market Analyst at PU Prime commented:\nEUR/USD remains supported as the U.S. dollar index (DXY) struggles near 97.35, reflecting persistent pressure on the greenback. With markets already pricing in a 25 bps Federal Reserve rate cut, sentiment has shifted toward the possibility of a larger move by year-end 2025. This dovish outlook is eroding dollar demand and strengthening the euro\u2019s appeal.\nThe upcoming U.S. retail sales report will be pivotal. A weaker reading would likely reinforce expectations of deeper Fed easing, further weighing on the dollar and boosting EUR/USD. While a strong surprise could slow the pair\u2019s advance, dollar fundamentals remain tilted toward weakness, keeping the near-term bias upward for EUR/USD.\nThe Fed is preparing for its first rate cut in almost a year, with futures markets assigning a 95% chance of a 25 bps move at the September meeting. The U.S. benchmark rate has remained at 4.25\u20134.50% since December 2024, but weakening labor data is shifting sentiment. August\u2019s jobs report showed only 22,000 positions added, well short of expectations, while unemployment has climbed to 4.3%. Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole remarks acknowledged a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in employment, reinforcing the dovish pivot. Markets now price in 75\u2013100 bps of cuts by year-end, a sharp shift that erodes the dollar\u2019s yield advantage.\nThe ECB has already cut by 200 bps since mid-2024, bringing the deposit rate down to 2.00%. President Lagarde has suggested the easing cycle is nearly complete, noting that rates are \u201cwell-positioned\u201d for current conditions. With eurozone inflation back at 2%, the central bank can afford to pause. While one or two further cuts are possible, the ECB is in a holding pattern, in sharp contrast to the Fed\u2019s impending easing. This divergence makes long-euro positions attractive, particularly as European fundamentals improve.\nU.S. GDP expanded 3.3% in Q2, but growth is feeding sticky inflation. Core PCE remains at 2.9%, limiting the Fed\u2019s flexibility. The eurozone, by contrast, has stabilized inflation at target, giving policymakers breathing room. Labor dynamics also favor Europe: eurozone unemployment is steady at 6.2%, while the U.S. labor market is showing cracks. Historical data revisions have erased nearly 1 million jobs, reinforcing the perception of slowdown.\nGermany has announced nearly \u20ac1 trillion in defense and infrastructure spending, boosting the growth outlook and complementing the ECB\u2019s less aggressive stance. Meanwhile, U.S. fiscal and trade policy complicates the Fed\u2019s task. Broad tariffs \u2014 10% on all imports, with higher rates for certain countries \u2014 are set to add 0.8\u20132.2 percentage points to core inflation. This asymmetric effect hurts the U.S. more than Europe: ECB research shows such tariffs may cut eurozone growth by 0.3\u20130.5 percentage points, but inflationary impact is muted.\nEUR/USD has decisively broken out of its multi-year 1.0500\u20131.1000 range and is consolidating near 1.1720. Resistance is seen at 1.1830, a key breakout trigger. Above that, Fibonacci extensions from the 2022 low at 0.9534 point to resistance at 1.1916 and 1.2019 \u2014 both converging with the 1.20000 target. A confirmed breakout above 1.1830 would validate the next bullish leg.\nInstitutional reallocation is reinforcing the bullish setup. European pension funds, if returning to 2015 allocation levels, could drive up to $217 billion in USD selling. Major banks are also backing the move higher: Morgan Stanley projects 1.2000\u20131.2500 by mid-2026, while Goldman Sachs "

UK CPI data is due tomorrow and is expected to rise to 3.9% amid a stagflationary outlook.\nThe central bank is expected to leave rates up 4% in Thursday's meeting. Given sticky inflation and concerns over the chancellor's budget in late December, the Bank of England may not cut rates until early next year.\nThis is in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which kicks off its two-day meeting today and is expected to reduce rates by 25 basis points in the right announcement tomorrow.

Sterling has strung together three consecutive weekly gains, advancing from lows near 1.3150 in August to current levels, as traders shift focus to central bank policy meetings on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFed Rate Cut Bets Pressure the Dollar\nMarket pricing shows nearly a 100% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed\u2019s September 16\u201317 meeting, which would lower the federal funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%. With unemployment claims spiking close to four-year highs and sentiment indices collapsing, pressure is mounting on the Fed to signal more easing into year-end. Inflation at 2.9% in August complicates the message, but Powell\u2019s remarks will be decisive. A dovish dot plot projecting rates closer to 3.00%\u20133.25% by end-2026 would confirm bearish momentum for the dollar, allowing GBP/USD to test the 1.3620\u20131.3650 resistance band.\nBank of England Steady as UK Budget Concerns Linger\nThe Bank of England meets on September 18, with markets widely expecting no policy change and the base rate to remain at 4.00%.

It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release f"

The AUD/USD pair appreciated as the US Dollar (USD) struggled ahead of the looming US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy meeting due on Wednesday.\nThe AUD could have received support after China and the United States (US) reached a commercial agreement on Monday to place TikTok under US ownership, with final approval anticipated during a Friday call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The move comes amid firm conviction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver a 25-basis-point (bps) interest rate cut at Wednesday\u2019s monetary policy meeting, a scenario markets now view as a done deal.\nAt the time of writing, AUD/USD trades near 0.6672, its strongest level in more than ten months. The pair has benefited from broad-based USD weakness, as traders fully price in imminent Fed easing. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering above eight-week lows around 97.30.\nFresh positioning data reinforced the shift in sentiment. The latest CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) report showed that net speculative short positions in AUD futures fell to around -79.2K contracts, compared with -82.7K previously. This marks the second straight week of reduced bearish exposure, driven partly by an uptick in long bets and short covering.\nMarket focus now turns to a heavy data calendar on both sides of the Pacific. In the US, Tuesday\u2019s Retail Sales will be pivotal in gauging consumer strength ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision.\nIn Australia, Thursday\u2019s employment report will be crucial for shaping Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy expectations. The central bank has flagged that the pace of any decline in the cash rate will largely be driven by labor market conditions, making this week\u2019s jobs data particularly sensitive for the currency.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Japanese Yen Talking Points:\n- USD/JPY has built into a hard range over the past six weeks, with the last attempted breakout on the July FOMC and BoJ rate decision snapped back after the NFP report.\n- EUR/JPY is nearing a major point of resistance while GBP/JPY is already testing a breakout above the 200.00 handle, both setups followed in these pieces and looked at in greater depth in the video below.\n- I\u2019ll be looking into all three markets in tomorrow\u2019s webinar and you\u2019re welcome to join. Click here to register.\nUSD/JPY remains in what\u2019s become a very consistent range and that\u2019s been the case since the first few days of August. Initially, USD/JPY broke out after the FOMC rate decision and that furthered on the BoJ rate decision in late-July. But the NFP report on the following Friday brought growth fears back around the US and USD/JPY was slammed back to support, which has held in the six weeks since.\nMaking matters there perhaps even more uninteresting is the fact that the range in USD/JPY has been just about 100 pips from recent support to resistance, which doesn\u2019t allow for much intra-day volatility, either.\nThe fact that the USD has been weak in many other major markets highlights the fact that USD/JPY is essentially marrying together two very weak currencies. And that weakness could be more attractive elsewhere, with either USD or JPY paired up with a currency like the Euro or British Pound. I\u2019ve been talking about this for some time now, including the late-July pullback. This is when EUR/JPY built support at the 170.00 handle, along with a higher-low, and GBP/JPY held support just four pips above the 195.00 level before bulls started to take-over again.\nThis week brings both the Fed and BoJ so there could be some motivation for trends, which I\u2019ll look at below.\nIn the major pair of USD/JPY, if we do see a Fed go slightly less dovish than what markets are looking for, there could be motive for topside, similar to what showed in July when Powell sounded not ready to cut rates. That led to a sizable breakout in USD/JPY that continued through the BoJ meeting and given how heavily rate cut expectations have priced-in to the US, it doesn\u2019t seem too low a bar for Powell to surprise to the upside.\nThat said, I think there\u2019s still the very real question in that scenario as to whether USD/JPY would be the most optimal pair to work with that Yen-weakness.\nUSD/JPY Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nAhead of the Fed and BoJ rate decision in July, we saw some fast position squaring in EUR/JPY. The pair quickly snapped back for a test of the 170.00 handle, which caught a rally around the BoJ meeting as the bank didn\u2019t sound ready to push more hawkish. But it\u2019s from that major move that a Fibonacci retracement was born that continues to hold value today.\nAs looked at last week, higher-low support held around the 172.30 level, and now we have a shorter-term test of support at prior resistance, between the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements.\nTaking a step back, there\u2019s now an ascending triangle formation in-play on the pair and that\u2019s a bullish breakout formation.\nAnd on the fundamental front, Christine Lagarde sounded less dovish at the ECB meeting last week, saying that \u2018the disinflationary process is over\u2019 and that the Eurozone economy is in a \u2018good place,\u2019 so if we do see the Fed push into a more dovish posture, that sets up divergence amongst the Central Banks which could justify greater Euro strength. I covered this in the article over the weekend in reference to EUR/USD, but it can similarly be adapted to EUR/JPY, as well.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nI\u2019ve favored GBP/JPY even over EUR/JPY, although that may shift this week after Lagarde\u2019s comments at ECB on Thursday. But, from a price action perspective the British Pound continues to lead the way as this morning ushered in a fresh yearly high on the pair.\nPerhap"

The pair closed at \u00a5147.66, after trading as high as \u00a5148.07 last week, showing the market\u2019s reluctance to break the range before this week\u2019s major central bank decisions.\nFed Policy Expectations Drive Correlation With USD/JPY\nMarket pricing shows four 25-basis-point cuts from the Federal Reserve by June 2026, totaling around 109 basis points. This expectation has tightened the negative correlation between rate cut pricing and USD/JPY to -0.87, meaning the pair moves almost inversely to Fed expectations. The Fed is widely expected to cut 25 bps this week, taking the funds rate to 4.00\u20134.25%. If the dot plot signals a funds rate near 3.00\u20133.25% by end-2026, aligned with market pricing, USD/JPY may remain stable. However, a more aggressive six-cut outlook would likely push the yen higher, testing \u00a5146.00 and below.\nU.S. Economic Data and Labour Market Pressures\nThe U.S. economy is flashing signs of strain. Weekly jobless claims spiked to levels not seen in almost four years, while consumer sentiment dropped sharply according to the University of Michigan survey. Inflation, however, surprised to the upside at 2.9% year-on-year in August, complicating the Fed\u2019s messaging. Weakness in retail sales or further deterioration in the Empire State Manufacturing Index \u2014 expected to fall from 11.9 to 3 \u2014 could accelerate dovish bets, pushing USD/JPY lower toward \u00a5146.20, the 50-day EMA.\nBank of Japan Balances Dovish Tone Against Market Pressure\nThe Bank of Japan meets this week with its policy rate at 0.5%, and markets are pricing a 20% chance of a hike. Since lifting rates in July 2024 and again in January 2025, the BOJ has signaled a pause, but political uncertainty following Prime Minister Ishiba\u2019s resignation has weakened sentiment. Traders see around two hikes priced through mid-2026, but Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s dovish reputation keeps expectations muted. If his tone shifts hawkish, USD/JPY could drop rapidly below \u00a5146.00, while vague or cautious guidance would reinforce resistance at \u00a5149.00.\nSafe-Haven Yen Demand on Global Market Stress\nThe yen has found modest support from safe-haven demand amid Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign rating to AA-, raising fears of European debt contagion. This risk-sensitive backdrop lifted the yen to \u00a5147.39 earlier this week. However, broader flows show investors still favoring U.S. yields, keeping the yen capped. The correlation of USD/JPY with equity volatility has collapsed, meaning risk appetite has little impact compared to the rate differential story.\nRead More\n-\nIWY ETF Climbs to $270.12 Backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and AI Growth\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Trades Above $115K\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Prediction: HG=F Climbs to $4.60 as Supply Strain Meets Fed Policy Shift\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Holds 1.3585 With Fed and BoE in Spotlight\n15.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY Levels\nOn charts, USD/JPY momentum indicators remain flat.

Investors seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path, while the US central bank will resume its rate-cutting cycle this week. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor driving flows towards the lower-yielding JPY and exerting downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nMeanwhile, the recent political developments in Japan could give the BoJ reasons to delay rate hikes. This, along with a positive risk tone, might keep a lid on any further appreciating move for the safe-haven JPY. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait for this week's key central bank events. The Fed is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Wednesday ahead of the two-day BoJ meeting starting Thursday, which will provide a fresh impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen is underpinned by BoJ rate hike bets, bearish USD\n- The Japanese Yen has been struggling for a firm near-term direction over the past week or so and oscillating in a range against its American counterpart amid ambiguity over the Bank of Japan rate hike decision. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation added a layer of uncertainty in the markets and could give the BoJ more reasons to go slow on interest rate hikes.\n- Japan's farm minister and the chief government spokesperson, Shinjiro Koizumi, on Tuesday announced his candidacy to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replace the outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.\n- Meanwhile, the US-Japan trade deal has removed some risks to domestic growth. The BoJ sees the development paving the way for steady progress toward the inflation target. Moreover, a tight labor market and optimistic economic outlook keep the door open for an imminent BoJ interest rate hike by the end of this year and offer some support to the JPY.\n- Moreover, the current market pricing points to a nearly two full 25-basis-point rate hikes by July next year, which, in turn, warrants some caution before placing aggressive JPY bearish bets. Traders might also opt to wait on the sidelines ahead of the latest BoJ monetary policy update on Friday. This, along with a bearish US Dollar, should cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near its lowest level since July 24 amid rising bets for a more aggressive policy easing by the US Federal Reserve. Traders ramped up their bets for three interest rate cuts by the Fed this year after the recent US macroeconomic data pointed to signs of a softening labor market.\n- The US Senate voted to confirm Stephen Miran \u2013 one of US President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisers \u2013 to join the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. Miran will now be voting on this week's interest rate decision. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who can participate in the pivotal two-day meeting starting Tuesday.\n- On the geopolitical front, Trump said on Monday that a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is difficult. This comes amid the intensifying Russia-Ukraine war and brewing Middle East tensions, which could further benefit the safe-haven JPY ahead of the key central bank events.\n- Tuesday's US economic docket features the release of US monthly Retail Sales figures and Industrial Production data later during the North American session.

The pair depreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could have received support from the improved Oil prices. WTI price received support after a potential supply disruption from Russia following Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure and mounting US pressure on buyers of Russian crude.\nMarkets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on Wednesday. Expectations for BoC easing have increased after data showed a loss of roughly 65,500 jobs in August and a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.1%. Traders will likely observe Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on Tuesday, which could influence the central bank\u2019s policy outlook.\nThe US Dollar (USD) depreciates against its peers as traders expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting due on Wednesday. However, there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut, with markets factoring in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\nTraders will also likely observe the Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the \u2018dot plot,\u2019 where each member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects the federal funds rate in the near future.\nMarkets are broadly expecting the Fed to deliver three straight 25 basis-point interest rate cuts through the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. Both brokerage firms projected on Friday a 25-basis-point rate reduction at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to"

                "body": "The Canadian dollar is flexing its muscles ahead of this week\u2019s inflation report, supported by stronger manufacturing sales and early signs of a technical reversal across CAD pairs. While soft employment data raises pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut rates, the broader picture suggests CAD bulls may not be done yet.\nView related analysis:\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/CAD\n- USD/CAD Technical Outlook: Futures Traders move Against the Canadian Dollar\n- AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY and ASX 200 Technical Setups: Key Levels in Focus\nCanadian Employment Weakness Fuels BoC Rate Cut Bets\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to cut its overnight cash rate (OCR) by 25bp to 2.5% on Wednesday, a move that the 1-month OIS has priced in with a 64% probability.\nWeakening labour market conditions are the main reason the BoC may be forced to resume its easing cycle, with employment contracting, participation declining, and unemployment climbing.\nEmployment fell for a second straight month in August, with the -65.5k drop marking the sharpest decline since January 2022. While the bulk of the losses came from part-time jobs (-59.7k), the deterioration is still significant. The participation rate slid to 65.1%, its lowest since May 2021, while the unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% \u2013 the highest since August 2021.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Manufacturing Rebound Eases Pressure on BoC\nWith the 1-year OIS only pricing a 54% chance of another 25bp cut, market expectations are not overly dovish. The BoC could adopt a more cautious tone with this week\u2019s rate cut, particularly after the surprise rebound in manufacturing sales.\nManufacturing sales rose 2.5% in July to $70.3 billion, the fastest pace since January 2023. The transportation sector led the gains, with auto and aerospace sales rebounding strongly. Normally, July sees temporary shutdowns in Ontario auto plants, but closures were less severe this year. Combined with a 6.7% rise in auto exports, the data suggests manufacturers are adapting to Trump\u2019s tariffs, signalling that the worst disruptions may have passed.\nIf stronger inflation figures follow, money markets could fully price out expectations of further rate cuts, potentially boosting the Canadian dollar broadly.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Inflation Data Key for BoC and Loonie Direction\nAttention now shifts to today\u2019s inflation report. Headline CPI has slowed to 1.7% y/y, but core CPI remains at 2.6%, the upper end of the BoC\u2019s target band. Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation at 3.0% and median CPI at 3.1% remain uncomfortably high for doves.\nCounterintuitively, the Canadian dollar could weaken if trimmed mean and median CPI linger deeper into the 3% range, as that would raise stagflation concerns and revive expectations for further BoC cuts. Conversely, even a modest cooling in these measures could give the BoC breathing space to be more cautious with its dovish messaging, potentially lifting the Canadian dollar.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis\nWe\u2019re seeing early signs of a reversal in favour of Canadian dollar bulls, and I expect these moves to extend. It\u2019s still early days, but CAD is trading higher against all its major FX peers so far this week, building on mixed success against them late last week.\nGBP/CAD formed a notable bearish engulfing candle around the June high on Monday, snapping its 7-day rally. A similar bearish engulfing pattern appeared on EUR/CAD, hinting at a near-term cycle high. The mighty Australian dollar has also allowed AUD/CAD to retrace for a third straight day from its highest level since November 2023. CAD/JPY has risen for a third day as well, though my bias remains neutral for now. USD/CAD, however, has caught my attention, as it appears to have finally printed the swing high I anticipated last week.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Chart"

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair experienced a pullback in Tuesday's trading, retreating from the year-to-date high of 200.75 touched the previous day. Nevertheless, the exchange rate remains above the psychological level of 200.00, indicating sustained buying interest.\nThe key driver of market sentiment is the upcoming release of UK inflation data. The UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to be the focal point for markets, and if the data exceeds expectations, it could reduce the likelihood of an immediate interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), thereby providing support for the pound.\nA London-based foreign exchange analyst stated: 'If the CPI shows resilience, the pound could gain renewed support in the short term, and GBP/JPY may retest its highs.'\nOn the other hand, the Japanese yen (JPY) has shown overall strength due to growing expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will raise interest rates. Investors believe the central bank will continue on its path toward policy normalization, despite uncertainties surrounding domestic political conditions. These expectations have provided fundamental support for the yen, exerting downward pressure on GBP/JPY.\nHowever, lingering doubts about the timing and pace of rate hikes may limit further upside potential for the yen.\nFrom a daily chart perspective, after encountering resistance near 200.75, GBP/JPY retreated but remains range-bound above the 200 level. Key resistance lies in the 200.80\u2013201.00 range, with a breakout potentially leading to new highs. Support is seen in the 199.50\u2013199.20 zone, with a breach likely triggering additional profit-taking.\nThe daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains elevated but has not entered the extreme overbought territory, suggesting that while upward momentum has slowed somewhat in the short term, the trend has not reversed.\nA Tokyo-based investment bank strategist noted: 'GBP/JPY may consolidate in the range of 199.50 to 201.00 in the short term, with the breakout direction likely depending on the outcome of the UK CPI data and BoE policy guidance.'\nEditor's Comment:\nThe movement of GBP/JPY is currently constrained by two factors: UK inflation data determines the direction of the pound, while expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan influence the strength of the yen. In the short term, if UK CPI data is strong, the pound may regain upward momentum and attempt to break through the 201 level again.\nIf the data is weak, the market may start pricing in a dovish path by the BoE in advance, leading to further downside risks for GBP/JPY. Overall, the pair remains in a high-range consolidation pattern, with attention required on fundamental triggers."

                "body": "GBP/JPY retreats from yearly high, holds above 200.00 ahead of UK jobs report\n|- GBP/JPY drifts lower on Tuesday and snaps a three-day winning streak to the YTD peak.\n- BoJ rate hike bets benefit the JPY and exert some downward pressure on spot prices.\n- Traders look to the UK jobs data for a short-term impetus ahead of key central bank events.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts some selling during the Asian session on Tuesday and for now, seems to have snapped a four-day winning streak to its highest level since July 2024, around the 200.75 region, touched the previous day. Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the 200.00 psychological mark as traders look forward to the UK employment details for a fresh impetus ahead of the key central bank events.\nThe UK jobs report, along with Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, could offer critical insight into the trajectory of inflation and its wider implications on monetary policy. A stronger-than-expected CPI print could further reduce the odds for an immediate interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), which is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday. This, in turn, could provide a goodish lift to the British Pound (GBP) and assist the GBP/JPY cross to attract some dip-buyers at lower levels.\nAhead of the key data, a broadly firmer Japanese Yen (JPY) exerts some downward pressure on spot prices. Despite domestic political turmoil, investors seem convinced that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor underpinning the JPY. That said, the uncertainty over the likely timing and the pace of rate hikes by the BoJ might cap gains for the JPY and help limit deeper losses for the GBP/JPY cross.\nFurthermore, the prevalent risk-on environment \u2013 as depicted by a generally positive mood around the equity markets \u2013 could offer some support to the currency pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the GBP/JPY cross has topped out in the near-term and positioning for any meaningful corrective decline.\n(The story was corrected on September 16 at 05:39 GMT, to say in the title, the third bullet point and the first paragraph that traders now look to UK jobs data, and not UK CPI.)\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards. It is the inflation measure used in the government\u2019s target. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Sep 17, 2025 06:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 3.9%\nPrevious: 3.8%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase of interest rates or the reduction of bond-buying by the BOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates looser monetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "Seasoned crypto traders have witnessed countless market cycles, yet there\u2019s a need to address a critical challenge plaguing today\u2019s investment landscape: major blockchain platforms are facing structural limitations that prevent the exponential returns sophisticated traders demand.\nWhile Solana benefits from Galaxy Digital\u2019s $700M institutional backing and Ethereum continues expanding into real-world applications like mortgage lending, both networks suffer from fundamental scalability constraints that cap their growth. The door is opening for newer, more agile projects that can sidestep all of these issues simultaneously, and the Layer Brett ($LBRETT) presale has caught everyone\u2019s attention accordingly. Let\u2019s find out why.\nETH\u2018s validator risks expose network vulnerabilities despite mortgage lending expansion\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent performance shows concerning patterns despite positive developments. While new innovations like litUSD stablecoin integration demonstrate ETH\u2019s expanding utility in mortgage lending markets, recent validator slashing events expose critical infrastructure vulnerabilities that institutional investors cannot ignore.\nEthereum\u2019s market cap approaching $500 billion creates mathematical constraints on explosive growth. For ETH to achieve 30x gains, the network would need to reach a $15 trillion valuation\u2014exceeding the entire current crypto market. These ceiling dynamics become apparent when analyzing institutional flow patterns and network congestion during peak usage periods.\nThe Federal Reserve rate cut environment benefits ETH price action short-term, but fails to address core scalability limitations. High gas fees during network congestion continue throttling retail adoption, while validator slashing incidents highlight centralization risks that sophisticated traders monitor closely.\nSOL\u2018s $700M institutional backing validates technology but limitations remain\nGalaxy Digital CEO Novogratz\u2019s endorsement of Solana as \u201ctailor-made\u201d for financial markets validates SOL\u2019s institutional-grade infrastructure. The $700M institutional accumulation through exchanges confirms professional trader confidence in Solana\u2019s technology stack and market positioning.\nAnalysts projecting SOL\u2019s $1,314 price target represents significant upside from current levels, yet this target reflects approximately 5-6x gains rather than the 30-50x exponential returns that create generational wealth. Solana\u2019s $100+ billion fully diluted valuation requires massive capital inflows to achieve true exponential growth.\nWhile Solana\u2019s speed and low transaction costs attract institutional adoption, the network\u2019s periodic outages and centralization concerns create trading volatility that limits sustained exponential momentum. Professional traders recognize SOL\u2019s strength while acknowledging mathematical growth constraints inherent in large-cap digital assets.\nLayer Brett\u2018s pricing unlocks exponential gains through Layer 2 innovation\nLayer Brett represents the mathematical evolution that transcends traditional blockchain limitations through innovative Layer 2 architecture. At $0.0058 per token with over $3.7 million raised, $LBRETT provides the low-cap entry mathematics that enable authentic exponential returns impossible with established networks.\nThe project\u2019s over 700% staking APY demonstrates how Layer 2 efficiency gains translate into tangible investor benefits. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees or Solana\u2019s intermittent outages, Layer Brett\u2019s infrastructure combines institutional-grade security with exponential presale mathematics that sophisticated traders demand.\nLayer Brett\u2019s presale positioning offers strategic advantages over both SOL and ETH ceiling dynamics. While Galaxy Digital accumulates Solana at premium valuations and Ethereum faces validator risks, early $LBRETT positioning provides mathematical exposure to 30-50x potential through proven Layer 2 technology and memecoin viral mechanics that drive explosive adoption"

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH), the foundational blockchain for countless decentralized applications, is poised for a significant surge, with recent analyses projecting its value to reach an impressive $9,801 by 2030. This optimistic forecast is not mere speculation but is firmly anchored in several transformative trends shaping the cryptocurrency landscape: the escalating adoption of Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions, the burgeoning influx of new institutional staking products, and the sustained, vigorous expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activities.\nThis potential ascent of Ethereum carries profound implications for the entire crypto market, signaling a maturing ecosystem and potentially redirecting capital flows. Investors and market participants are now closely watching how these intertwined developments will reshape the future of digital finance and the broader Web3 economy, cementing Ethereum's role as a cornerstone of decentralized innovation.\nThe Triple Engines of Growth: Layer-2s, Institutional Staking, and DeFi/NFT Boom\nThe anticipated climb of Ethereum to nearly $10,000 is underpinned by a confluence of technological advancements and market dynamics. Each driver plays a critical role in enhancing Ethereum's utility, accessibility, and appeal to a widening demographic of users and institutions.\nLayer-2 networks are at the forefront of this transformation. As Ethereum's mainnet grapples with scalability challenges, L2 solutions like Arbitrum (ARBITRUM) and Optimism (OP) have emerged as vital conduits, offloading transaction processing from the main blockchain while maintaining its security. By reducing gas fees and speeding up transaction times, L2s are making the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly and economically viable for a broader range of applications and users. Industry experts, including VanEck, foresee a colossal $1 trillion collective market capitalization for Ethereum's Layer-2 protocols by 2030, a testament to their pivotal role in scaling the network and driving its adoption. This expansion is critical, ensuring that Ethereum can handle the increasing demand stemming from DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications without succumbing to network congestion or prohibitive costs.\nSimultaneously, the crypto world is witnessing an unprecedented influx of institutional interest, particularly in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking mechanism. The introduction of institutional-grade staking products and the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are monumental catalysts. These regulated investment vehicles provide traditional financial institutions and their clients with a secure and compliant pathway to gain exposure to ETH, which was previously a barrier for many. Analysts suggest that these ETFs will not only attract substantial capital but also effectively remove a significant amount of ETH from circulation as it gets staked, contributing to a potential supply squeeze. This institutional embrace, evidenced by major firms accumulating ETH at a pace exceeding retail demand, indicates a structural shift that could exert sustained upward pressure on Ethereum's price. Companies like Coinbase (COIN) and Fidelity (FNF) are among those expected to play a key role in facilitating this institutional adoption through their various staking and custodial services.\nFinally, the relentless expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity continues to cement Ethereum's dominance. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of the DeFi landscape, commanding the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) by a significant margin compared to other blockchains. This dominance means that the vast majority of innovative financial applications, from lending protocols to decentralized exchanges, operate on or are closely integrated with Ethereum. The thriving NFT market, too, predominantly relies on Ethereum, with iconic marketplaces like OpenSea and prominent colle"

HODL STKE (\"SOL Strategies\" or the \"Company\"), a publicly traded Canadian company focused on investing in and providing infrastructure for the Solana blockchain ecosystem, marks the one-year anniversary of its strategic transformation from a Bitcoin holding company to North America's first publicly traded enterprise dedicated to the Solana ecosystem. The transformation has delivered shareholder value while establishing new categories of institutional blockchain participation through the Company's DAT++ model.\n\"Twelve months ago, we didn't just pivot our strategy, we developed an entirely new business model within the digital asset treasury space,\u201d said CEO Leah Wald. \u201cOur DAT++ approach combines traditional treasury holdings with infrastructure-driven validator revenues, creating dual revenue engines that compound growth. What makes this transformation remarkable is that we\u2019ve built this comprehensive operation from essentially a blank canvas, assembling a world-class team while achieving a Nasdaq cross-listing.\u201d\nFinancial Performance Milestones\nTreasury Growth: Solana treasury expanded from $0 SOL holdings as of March 31, 2024, to $144 million, holding 435,064 SOL tokens with total assets reaching $164 million.\nProfitability Achievement: Achieved $800,000 adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DAT++ model's dual revenue approach.\nFinancial data available on the Company's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca and investor relations page at https://solstrategies.io/investors/, see page 16 of the Company's Management Discussion and Analysis for the Three and Nine Months ended June 30, 2025.\nThe DAT++ Competitive Advantage\nDeveloped the DAT++ approach, combining digital asset treasury holdings with validator infrastructure operations to create dual revenue streams that compound growth at nearly double traditional staking-only models.\nOperational Milestones\nValidator Network: Operates over CAD $1.24 billion in delegated SOL across five validators, managing 3.73 million SOL tokens with over 12,000 unique staking participants.\nSource: Delegated SOL valuations calculated using SOL = $332 CAD as of 11:30am ET September 12, 2025.\nTechnology Leadership: One of the first validators running Firedancer, launched the first native Solana staking mobile app, developed multiple open-source packages adopted across the Solana ecosystem, and created Dune dashboard reporting enabling daily investor tracking.\nCompliance Leadership: Completed SOC1 Type 1, SOC 2 Type 1, and ISO 27001 audits, establishing enterprise grade institutional compliance standards that enable enterprise adoption.\nNasdaq Listing: Achieved cross-listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under ticker \"STKE\" on September 9, 2025, becoming the first Solana-focused company to reach this milestone.\nStrategic Partnerships\nSelected by ARK Invest as exclusive Solana staking provider for their Digital Asset Revolutions Fund. Established strategic partnerships with Neptune Digital Assets (CSE: NDA) and integration with BitGo's institutional custody platform.\nSecured USD $500 million convertible note facility with ATW Partners, $25 million facility from former Chairman Antanas Guoga and a $30 million financing from ParaFi Capital. Filed a preliminary shelf prospectus in Canada providing flexibility for future growth initiatives.\nStrategic Acquisitions and Growth\nExecuted three strategic acquisitions, Cogent, Orangefin, and Laine's validator network,that helped transform the Company into the vertically integrated Solana infrastructure operation it is today.

Even with the correction, SOL gained 24% in the past 30 days, supported by stronger onchain activity.\nTraders are now debating whether the current momentum could push SOL toward $300, especially as the Solana network has regained its lead in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\nIn September, Solana surpassed Ethereum to become the top blockchain for DEX trading. The network processed $121.8 billion in monthly volumes, about 90% higher than competitor BNB Chain. Securing leadership in this segment is key because higher volumes generate more fees, which creates recurring demand for SOL to pay for those transactions.\nAccording to Nansen data, fees on Solana rose 23% over the past seven days. The increase is notable given that Ethereum still has nearly seven times more total value locked (TVL). Yet ETH holders see limited benefits from that base since many decentralized applications, including restaking and real-world assets (RWA), show low turnover and weak fee generation.\nCorporate treasury allocations accelerate demand for SOL\nRecent corporate treasury activity has boosted demand for SOL. Some companies are raising capital through stock or debt offerings and allocating the proceeds to cryptocurrency. One example is Forward Industries (FORD), originally a medical and technology design firm, which raised $1.65 billion in private funding and used the proceeds to acquire SOL for its reserves.\nForward Industries was financed by Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Jump Crypto \u2014 both a market maker and venture capital fund \u2014 and Multicoin Capital, known for early bets on Helium (HNT), Filecoin (FIL), Solana, and Polkadot (DOT). Separately, a Solana-focused treasury firm called DeFi Development Corp disclosed holdings exceeding 2 million SOL, valued at more than $460 million.\nPantera Capital, another major blockchain asset manager, announced on Monday the launch of a new Solana-backed treasury vehicle, the Nasdaq-listed Helius (HSDT). The $500 million initial private placement was co-led by the Hong Kong-licensed fund manager Summer Capital and could expand to over $1 billion, according to the press release.\nRelated: Bitcoin and Solana ETPs lead $3.3B crypto inflow rebound: CoinShares\nAnother possible tailwind for SOL comes from a proposed open-source bridge between Solana and Base, an Ethereum layer-2 developed by Coinbase. Base has more than 20 million active addresses in 30 days, according to Nansen. The bridge would let users move assets across chains, creating what Base creator Jesse Pollak called a more \u201cinteroperable and connected\u201d ecosystem.\nThe Trump-backed crypto initiative World Liberty Financial (WLFI) also announced on Monday a partnership with Solana\u2019s memecoin platform Bonk.fun and the Raydium DEX to fund \u201cmultimillion-dollar promotional rewards.\u201d The effort targets USD1 stablecoin pairs, with WLFI\u2019s token reportedly backed entirely by US dollars and cash equivalents.\nConsidering Solana\u2019s expanding onchain activity, the accumulation of SOL by treasury-focused firms, and the visibility from the Base bridge and WLFI campaign, traders see conditions for further upside. A rally to $300 would give Solana a $163 billion market capitalization, still representing a 70% discount to Ether\u2019s $543 billion valuation, making the scenario plausible in the near term.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The recent rally surged the SOL price toward $250 resistance line before falling back below $235. Now the price has fallen to $230 as the bulls are trying to establish foothold above $230.\nFrom a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at 2.18, with the indicator showing rising selling pressure with recent candles. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) fell to 43.96, indicating that Solana faces strong resistance at the $250 mark and SOL needs to defend the $230 level to prevent a breakdown towards $212.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from Solana price analysis?\nThe Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $200. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards.\nAs the price falls back to $230, SOL can be expected to hold steady at the level and continue rising towards the $245 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $235, SOL may fall back to the $212 support continuing the consolidation.\nIs SOL a good investment?\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked (TVL).

It projects free cash flow from its machinery, energy, and transportation businesses to be around $7.5 billion in 2025, versus $9.4 billion last year.\nAdvertisement\n3. International Business Machines: Down 3.8%\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) stock dropped sharply on July 24 after releasing Q2 numbers and continued to fall through August, losing 3.8% in the month. Ironically, IBM's revenue rose 8% year over year, and management now expects 2025 free cash flow to exceed its guidance of $13.5 billion, driven by growth in software.\nSoftware alone made up 43% of IBM's revenue in Q2. Last year, IBM generated $12.7 billion in FCF.\nIBM shares fell because its software revenue growth missed analysts' estimates.

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.\nTesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.\nAlphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.\nThe market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.\nStocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.\nThat\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.\nWhat\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nAnother threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.\nTrump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors from its board.\n\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network Monday, using his trademark all-caps style.\nOn Wall Street, Intel rose 2.9% after trimming its forecast for expenses this year. The move came after it completed the sale of a 51% stake in its Altera business to the Silver Lake investment firm.\nThat helped offset a 24.7% drop for Hain Celestial, which reported a larger loss for its latest quarter than it did a year earlier. Interim CEO Alison Lewis said the owner of \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d brands like Terra chips is making moves to stabilize sales \u201cas we recognize our performance has not met expectations.\u201d\nAlaska Air Group lost 6.7% after the airline said high fuel costs will likely cause its third-quarter results to come in at the low end of its forecasted range. It also cited higher expenses for overtime pay and passengers\u2019 compensation after bad weather and air-traffic control issues led to difficult operations in the summer, though it saw strong airfare trends thanks to demand for premium seats.\nNvidia edged down by less than 0.1% after China accused the chip company of violating its antimonopoly laws. Chinese regulators did not mention a punishment for Nvidia in a one-sentence statement on the matter but did say they would carry out \u201cfurther investigation.\u201d\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 30.99 points to 6,615.28.

It jumped to a record high of \u00a39.343, up by over 23% from its lowest level this week. This article highlights some of the top catalysts that may drive the Footsie Index this week.\nUK jobs, inflation, and retail sales data\nCopy link to sectionThe first main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer jobs numbers on Tuesday. Economists expect the upcoming jobs report to show that the economy added 158k jobs in the three months to July, much lower than the previous 238k.\nThey expect the data to reveal that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7%, while the average earnings rose by 4.8%.\nThe other main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer inflation data on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming data to reveal that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.9% in August from 3.8%, while the core CPI slowed to 3.7%.\nThese numbers will confirm that the UK is in a period of stagflation, which is characterized by a high inflation rate and slow economic growth. It is normally a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare because there is usually no good response mechanism.\nThe ONS will then publish the latest retail sales data on Friday. These numbers will provide more information about the health of the economy.\nBank of England interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision on Thursday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to take the UK inflation and jobs numbers into consideration when making these decisions.\nMost analysts see the bank leaving interest rates unchanged at 4% as cutting interest rates to boost the economy will likely have a negative effect on inflation.\nThere will be two key drivers for the FTSE 100 and sterling in this decision. First, they will react to a news on quantitative tightening in the UK, with analysts expecting the annual figure to be between \u00a3380 billion and \u00a3550 billion this year.\nSecond, the vote split will be watched closely as investors reflect on what to expect later this year. Market participants expect either one or no interest rate cuts this year.\nRead more: Bank of England cuts rates to 4% in historic split vote\nUK Gilt yields\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the performance of the UK bond market, commonly known as gilts.\nData shows that the 10-year yield has eased to 4.65%, while the 30-year one dropped to 5.48%, down from the year-to-date high of 5.75%.\nA hawkish Bank of England decision will likely lead to higher yields, which will likely impact the stock market. Historically, investors tend to move to the bond market when yields rise.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest decision on Wednesday.\nThis will be an important decision as it will be the first time that the central bank slashes interest rates this year.\nA Fed cut may positively impact American and global equities. However, the risk is that the interest rate cuts have already been priced in."

But domestic momentum has been strong: positive updates from Sainsbury and AO World helped the FTSE 250 outperform, offering a glimpse of optimism even when blue-chips stumble. Central bank decisions could fuel ongoing volatility, but resilient retailers show there\u2019s still upside if you know where to look.\nThe bigger picture: Investment signals point to bigger UK shifts.\nThe UK\u2019s ability to attract blockbuster investment is under scrutiny as big pharma pump the brakes on growth, putting a spotlight on the need for clear policies and attractive business conditions. Meanwhile, new tech and civil nuclear deals with the US\u2014and negotiations over steel tariffs\u2014reflect an effort to strengthen global economic ties.

                "body": "European stock markets, led by a resurgent German DAX index, have delivered an unexpectedly strong performance in 2025, marking a significant turnaround from previous years. This robust growth, fueled by renewed investor confidence and strategic economic shifts, has seen key indices reach multi-year highs and even all-time records, positioning Europe as a compelling investment destination. The unexpected surge highlights a pivotal moment for the continent's financial landscape, promising potential ripple effects across various sectors and altering global investment flows.\nThe impressive gains signal a broader recalibration of investor perception towards European equities, driven by a confluence of attractive valuations, evolving monetary policies, and targeted fiscal stimuli. This performance not only defies earlier cautious forecasts but also underscores a growing conviction in the region's economic resilience and corporate profitability, setting the stage for a potentially transformative period for public companies and the wider European economy.\nA Continental Revival: What Happened and Why it Matters\nThe year 2025 has witnessed a remarkable resurgence across European stock markets, with the German DAX index taking center stage in this impressive rally. As of September 15, 2025, the DAX stood at an impressive 23,744 points, registering a substantial 27.43% increase over the past year. The index's year-to-date (YTD) return reached 20.88% by May and further climbed to 34.60% by early September, even touching an all-time high of 24,641.50 in July. This strong performance marks the first time in over two decades that European equities have significantly outperformed their U.S. counterparts, signaling a profound shift in global investment patterns.\nBeyond Germany, the optimism permeated broader European markets. The Morningstar Europe Index gained 6% in Q1 2025 and was up almost 11% YTD by May. The EURO STOXX 50 (STOXX: SX5E) surged 3.5% in February and saw a 10.81% increase in USD terms during Q1, reaching 5,426 points by mid-September and an all-time high of 5,568.65 in March. Similarly, the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX: SXXP) recorded its best start to a year since 2019 in absolute terms and its strongest relative start against the STOXX USA 500 since 2001. This collective ascent is not merely statistical; it signifies a pivotal moment where European markets are regaining investor trust and demonstrating robust fundamental strengths.\nSeveral factors have converged to propel this bullish trend. A crucial element has been the shift in investor sentiment, as evidenced by the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany, which rebounded sharply through mid-2025, reflecting growing optimism. Economically, Germany initiated a historic fiscal expansion, including a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund and increased defense spending, signaling a departure from its traditional fiscal conservatism. Simultaneously, the European Central Bank (ECB) began easing monetary policy with interest rate cuts, anticipated to stimulate the economy and corporate profitability. Furthermore, European stocks entered 2025 with attractive valuations compared to their US counterparts, drawing global investors seeking value and diversification.\nRobust corporate earnings throughout late 2024 and early 2025 also provided a significant impetus. Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 generally exceeded earnings expectations, and projections suggest that Europe's annualized profit growth could outpace the U.S. for the first time in over a decade. Geopolitical factors, such as hopes for de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict and increased defense spending across the EU, further stimulated economic activity and investor confidence. The relative underperformance of the US market in early 2025, driven by election uncertainty and trade tensions, also encouraged a reallocation of capital towards the more attractively valued European markets.\nNavigating the Boom: Winners Emerge Ac"

                "body": "RFK Jr.'s MAHA report on children's health leaves something out: nicotine\nTrump administration report on children's health leaves one thing out: nicotine\nFrances Daniels, a Baltimore mother of three, read the Trump administration's 20-page report called \"Make Our Children Healthy Again,\" and noticed some notable words were missing from it: \"Smoking\" and \"nicotine.\"\nThe word \"tobacco\" is mentioned once in the document, in a reference to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\"I was horrified,\" Daniels says. \"It never once mentioned substance usage. Specifically: nicotine.\"\nThat was of grave concern to Daniels, because nicotine and the chemicals vaped with it, hooked and nearly killed one of her children three years ago. Her child spent six brutal weeks in the hospital with EVALI, a lung injury caused by e-cigarette use. \"They had about six tubes in their lungs at one point, draining fluid out \u2014 three on each side with machines on either side of the bed.\"\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the strategy is \"mobilizing every part of government to confront the childhood chronic disease epidemic.\" The administration's list of recommendations in its report calls for public-service campaigns about the risks of alcohol, controlled substances, and vaping. It also recommends continued crack downs on illegally imported vapes, and the health agency announced an $86 million seizure of e-cigarettes last week.\nNPR has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for comment.\nA priority in Trump 1.0\nThe report's prescriptions sound too weak to Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. She says it contrasts with President Trump's stance in 2019, when she met with him.\n\"He was in the Rose Garden and in the Oval Office, talking about youth vaping,\" she says of his emphasis on prevention, during his first term. \"The fact there is not a greater emphasis put on tobacco and nicotine, which is harming youth \u2014 it's very, very surprising.\"\nTobacco use remains the top cause of preventable death in the US.\nThat's why Brian King \u2014 an epidemiologist and former head of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products \u2014 says omissions of smoking, tobacco and other nicotine products make no sense. \"Something to combat chronic disease without tobacco control is like attempting a triathlon without a bicycle \u2014 you are destined for failure before leaving the starting line,\" King says.\nCuts to successful tobacco control efforts\nKing, now executive vice president at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the administration's stated support for public awareness and greater enforcement run counter to its recent actions. \"In the same breath, the administration has eliminated the very unit that conducts that work at FDA,\" he says. He also notes the Trump administration eliminated the Office of Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which funded state tobacco control programs \u2014 some of which King says are in the process of shutting down.\nSuch programs are credited with dramatic reductions in smoking \u2014 and more recently vaping \u2014 among teens.\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration also withdrew plans to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes, despite the fact that flavored tobacco and nicotine are known to be a major draw for young people, says Priya Fielding-Singh, director of policy at the Global Food Institute at George Washington University. \"An educational campaign isn't a compelling substitute for enacting tobacco regulation to keep these products out of the hands of kids and teens,\" Fielding-Singh said in a statement.\nNevertheless, smoking and vaping are falling out of favor with adolescents, and Penn State public health professor Jonathan Foulds says therefore young people today are at far less risk \u2014 especially compared to the many other public-health threats they face. \"Nicotine itself is not very high on the list of public health priorities for kids,\" Foulds says"

                "body": "The Trump administration released its latest report Tuesday on how to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d the second installment of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s strategy to combat chronic disease among children. While this report amplified calls to address long-standing environmental and behavioral practices that harm kids, experts said it was slim on details about how to turn policy priorities into regulatory action. They also worried about a disconnect between what this report says and how the Trump administration has unraveled research that would address these issues.\nSince the Senate confirmed him in February, Kennedy has promoted the concept and use of what he calls \u201cgold-standard science\u201d to expose the causes of child health outcomes, a phrase he repeated today when speaking about how the commission behind the report would proceed with development rules and recommendations.\nBut health and environmental experts who spoke to PBS News said his actions speak louder than words; research has shown that actions like the administration\u2019s push to shred health and environmental regulations could contribute to worsening, not improving, the outcomes and wellbeing of children.\n\u201cSecretary Kennedy has correctly identified chronic disease as a major driver of poor health and high healthcare costs,\u201d said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a written statement. \u201cBut neither his record as health secretary nor most of the policies outlined in this report inspire confidence that he is the right person to solve this problem.\u201d\nThe much-anticipated report was brief, fewer than 20 written pages filled with bullet points highlighting several policy priorities that Kennedy and the Trump administration have already touted or acted on in recent months.\n\u201cA lot of these 128 recommendations are things I\u2019ve been dreaming about my whole life,\u201d Kennedy said Tuesday at a press conference.\nMarc Weisskopf, a professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, told PBS News that he was particularly heartened to see that the Trump administration says it is paying attention to the role that a lack of physical activity, access to nutritious foods and environmental factors can shape children\u2019s health outcomes.\nBut he also pointed to the disconnect between what this report says and how the Trump administration has unraveled research to better understand these issues and regulations designed to address them.\nIf the goal is to deliver \u201cgold-standard science\u201d and to protect children\u2019s health, Weisskopf said, \u201cWe need people who are knowledgeable about this work to be around the table.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the issues the latest report seeks to address, and some important factors experts say were overlooked:\nTargeting poor diet, additives and fluoride\nIn the same report where the administration slammed lax standards on food and linked them to deteriorated health outcomes, the Trump administration called for deregulation of agriculture and food.\nEmphasizing the need for revamped dietary guidelines, the report called for changes in committees and task forces that advise the federal government about these standards. The report slammed the availability of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d and the use of artificial food dyes, building on Kennedy\u2019s previously announced plans to phase out certain dyes in April. The administration pledged to increase testing for heavy metals like lead in infant formula, and look for ways to boost breastfeeding rates nationwide.\nThe report also re-upped Kennedy\u2019s campaign against fluoride, stating that the CDC would update recommendations for fluoride and PFAS in drinking water. Public health experts have celebrated fluoride as one of the great innovations in cavity prevention and improved dental health.\nThe National Institutes of Health will link health insurance claims informatio"

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)\nCiting \u201cmultiple reports of deeply troubling\u201d comments made by teachers and school personnel concerning the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson on Friday advised school districts to investigate educators making such comments and refer them to the Virginia Board of Education for licensure revocation.\nSocial media comments concerning Kirk\u2019s death have proliferated in Virginia, including remarks by school system workers in Accomack, Chesterfield, and Orange counties and the city of Newport News that have stoked controversy.\n22-year-old Utah man in custody suspected of killing Charlie Kirk\nOn Sunday, Axios Richmond reported that Chesterfield County School Board member Dorothy Heffron announced she would resign at the end of her term on December 31, following her widely criticized social media post that drew condemnation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is also running for governor, and other leaders.\n\u201cCall me old fashioned, but I remember when we used to be okay with shooting Nazis,\u201d Heffron wrote on Instagram. Her account has since been deleted.\n\u201cParents entrust our educators with the care and development of their children, and they rightly expect teachers and school leaders to model the values of respect, civility, and responsibility,\u201d said Gullickson in a statement. \u201cAnyone who would suggest the heinous murder of the father of two young children is acceptable should be disqualified from teaching or working with children again.\u201d\nHeffron\u2019s remarks struck a nerve among Republicans including Youngkin and. Earle-Sears, who claimed on Sept. 14 that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger had not responded to the tragedy or social media remarks.\nSpanberger shared a statement with Richmond TV news station WWBT on Sept. 12 condemning political violence.\n\u201cAs the investigation continues and law enforcement continues to build their case, I think it\u2019s important to state unequivocally: I condemn any efforts to justify or minimize the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk or anyone else,\u201d Spanberger wrote.\nThe Virginia Education Association (VEA), the largest union for teachers and support specialists, questioned the superintendent\u2019s response when, according to VEA President Carol Bauer, their members face harassment through various forms.\n\u201cThis is a little bit of political overreach. I certainly agree that educators should model professionalism. We really cannot support a blanket condemnation that fails to distinguish between private personal expression and professional conduct,\u201d Bauer said to 13News Now.\nHowever, Bauer said the association \u201cstands ready\u201d to support its members \u201cwhose due process rights have been violated in this climate.\u201d\nIn Virginia, multiple cases have arisen regarding remarks about the death of the 31-year-old, who was a husband and father of two young children.\nOne case involving an unnamed staff member at Newport News Public Schools was suspended after reportedly stating, \u201cI hope he suffered through all of it,\u201d in reference to Kirk.\nA staff member of Accomack County Public Schools is also under investigation for a comment posted on social media, according to Superintendent Gennifer Miller. Republicans including Earle-Sears have also highlighted another Central Virginia teacher\u2019s comments about Kirk.\nDel.
