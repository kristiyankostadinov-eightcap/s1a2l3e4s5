                "body": "Gold was trading at $3,348 per ounce at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on August 12, 2025. This is a $8 fall from yesterday at the same hour and $882 higher than a year ago.\nFor investors wanting an asset less affected by inflation, gold may be a wise choice. Historically, Gold is an asset that appreciates over time. Rather than collecting the actual physical gold manifestations, many people use a gold IRA, which also offers the convenience of not having to store physical gold, which can come with its own cost. Regardless of how you purchase gold, it can help serve as a steady part of a portfolio during market volatility.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for December 5, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.18% for December 5, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for December 5, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for December 5, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for December 5, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for December 5, 2025.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold isn\u2019t a guaranteed answer in every financial environment. In a strong economy, stocks can deliver better returns both in the short and long term. From 1971 to 2024, traditional stocks averaged 10.7% annual returns, while gold averaged 7.9%.\nStill, gold is a reliable, risk-averse asset during economic uncertainty. That\u2019s why some investors see it more as a store of value instead of a typical investment like stocks or bonds.\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot price is the current rate for buying or selling gold immediately in over-the-counter trades. This helps investors track gold demand and market trends. A higher spot price means stronger demand. Unlike futures, the spot price is for immediate settlement.\nWhen the price for future delivery is above the spot price, it\u2019s called contango, which is common for commodities with storage costs. If the futures price is lower, it\u2019s called backwardation.\nMany factors can cause the spot price to fluctuate. Investors should be prepared for this volatility.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nThe price spread is the gap between the buying and selling price of an asset.\nIn gold trading, the ask price is the cost to buy, and the bid price is what you\u2019d get for selling. The bid is always less than the ask.\nA smaller spread means a more liquid market. Tight spreads typically indicate higher gold demand.\nHow to invest in gold\nIf you picture gold investing as a suitcase filled with gold bars, that\u2019s only part of the story. While buying physical bars, coins, or jewelry is an option, most gold trading happens via exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nJames Taska, a fee-based financial advisor, says, \u201cThere is a great debate as to whether paper gold is as useful as the physical. From a financial advisor\u2019s viewpoint, it is much easier to rebalance a client\u2019s allocation of gold if it is owned as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the spread when attempting to buy/sell gold can be quite variable and wide.\u201d\nPopular ways to invest in gold include:\n- Gold bars and rounds: Also known as bullion, sold by weight, with purity and manufacturer details marked.\n- Gold coins: Collectible coins like the American Gold Eagle, often priced higher than bars due to rarity.\n- Gold jewelry: Priced above gold content for design and craftsmanship.\n- Gold futures contracts: Agreements to buy gold at a future date, allowing speculation without handling the metal.\n- Gold funds: Mutual funds or ETFs invested in gold, with values tied to the underlying assets.\nIs it a good time to invest in gold?\nDeciding if now is the right time to invest in gold is subjective. However, gold can help diversify your portfolio and reduce market risk.\nGold remains a stable asset amid market volatility. Prices have reached record highs, up more than 25% since early 2025, driven by inflation and uncertainty. Many experts recommend adding gold for diversification.\nCurrent precious me"

                "body": "Gold Price: Gold\u2019s remarkable rally shows no signs of easing as it heads into 2026, and market experts believe the precious metal may now be poised for another strong upward surge.\nIn a recent report, brokerage house Ventura said that it believes a \u201ccocktail powered by central bank buying, stubborn inflation, widening US deficits, and concerns around the US economy and tariffs\u201d could propel gold prices to a target range of $4,600\u2013$4,800 in the coming year.\nAn expectation of 75 bps worth of US Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 is expected to keep strong bidding interest alive and deepen the metal\u2019s multi-year bull market.\nVentura highlights that gold\u2019s bullish cycle remains \u201cfar from over\u201d as institutional investors increasingly seek an inflation hedge, followed by rising retail and speculative participation. The firm notes that this layered demand is strengthening the foundation of gold\u2019s long-term rally.\nMeanwhile, last month, Deutsche Bank had lifted its 2026 gold price forecast to $4,450 an ounce, up from $4,000 earlier, citing steadier investor inflows and sustained central-bank buying. The bank now anticipates gold to trade in a $3,950\u2013$4,950 range next year, with the upper end sitting roughly 14% above the current December 2026 COMEX futures price.\nIt described a \u201cpositive structural backdrop,\u201d noting that strong central-bank purchases and ETF inflows are absorbing a large share of available supply, leaving less metal for jewellery demand even as total demand continues to exceed supply. Deutsche Bank kept its 2027 forecast at $5,150, saying the estimate \u201cstraddles the uncertainty\u201d between a normalised market environment and a scenario of prolonged elevated official-sector buying.\nFurther more, Morgan Stanley, in an earlier report, had predicted that gold could rise to $4,500 per ounce by mid-2026, supported by firm physical demand from exchange-traded funds and ongoing central-bank purchases amid a cloudy global economic outlook. The bank noted that gold had recently entered overbought territory on the RSI gauge, but the latest pullback has \u201creset the market to a healthier level,\u201d improving positioning. Morgan Stanley expects ETF inflows to strengthen as interest rates fall, while central-bank buying should continue\u2014though at a more moderate pace\u2014alongside stabilising jewellery demand.\nThe brokerage also warned of downside risks, including bouts of volatility that may drive investors toward alternative assets, as well as the possibility of central banks trimming their gold holdings, which could weigh on prices.\nMeanwhile, brokerage house HDFC Securities notes that gold\u2019s investment appeal has strengthened significantly amid persistent inflation, expectations of lower real interest rates and weakening faith in fiat currencies. The brokerage emphasises gold\u2019s ability to hedge against geopolitical conflict, market volatility and deteriorating fiscal conditions across major Western economies.\nHDFC Securities recommends that investors allocate 5\u201310% of their portfolios to precious metals such as gold and silver, with scope to increase exposure gradually depending on risk appetite. Despite short-term volatility, the firm believes gold\u2019s medium-to-long-term outlook remains \u201cstructurally strong.\u201d\nStrong rally to $4299 was driven by expectations of a Fed rate cut (Dec 9th \u2013 10th). The prospect of lower US interest rates continues to support gold and building confidence in December rate cut. Investors betting that softening inflation and signs of cooling labor conditions will give policymakers room to ease while dollar weakened.\nAccording to Ventura, gold has printed new highs for nine consecutive quarters, including Q4 2025, reflecting one of the most powerful multi-year rallies in modern history. The surge signals what Ventura calls a systemic deterioration in fiat currency value, a trend reinforced by gold now ranking as the second most important reserve asset among global central banks.\nIn India, the bullishness appears even m"

                "body": "Crude oil prices stabilized near two-week peaks on Monday, buoyed by expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut and escalating geopolitical risks in key producing regions. Brent crude futures traded around $63.81 per barrel, up 0.09 percent on the day, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude hovered near $60.16, reflecting a 0.13 percent gain. Despite year-to-date declines of over 11 percent, the benchmarks remained on track for weekly advances, underscoring a fragile balance between supply concerns and demand optimism.\nAnticipation of a Fed rate reduction this week dominated trading sentiment, as lower borrowing costs could spur U.S. economic growth and lift fuel consumption in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer. Markets priced in a high probability of a 25-basis-point cut, potentially easing recession fears and supporting industrial activity. Geopolitical premiums further bolstered prices, with stalled U.S.-Russia talks over Ukraine sustaining sanctions on Moscow\u2019s energy exports and enabling ongoing Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries and pipelines.\nTensions extended to Venezuela, where President Donald Trump\u2019s signals of imminent action raised fears of disruptions to the country\u2019s 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) output, according to Rystad Energy estimates. Ukrainian attacks, including on the Druzhba pipeline, heightened supply risks without immediate flow interruptions, while Russian tanker activity surged amid U.S. sanctions. These factors offset softer elements, positioning oil for its first weekly rise in weeks.\nSupply and demand pressures\nBearish counters capped upside potential. U.S. inventories rose by 574,000 barrels last week per EIA data, alongside gasoline and distillate builds, signaling ample stockpiles. Saudi Arabia slashed its January Arab Light crude price for Asia to a five-year low, reflecting weak regional demand, while Canadian heavy oil weakened. OPEC+ production hikes and surging non-OPEC output from the U.S., Brazil, and Canada fueled oversupply worries, with the IEA forecasting a market surplus next year.\nForecasts varied, with Trading Economics projecting Brent at $64.17 by quarter-end and $69.96 in 12 months, driven by macro models balancing risks. JP Morgan warned of a plunge to the $30s by FY27-end if non-OPEC supply outpaces demand, citing shale expansions and inventory builds.\nRead more: Oil prices fall to $63.21 as market awaits key inflation data ahead of Fed meeting\nSaudi price cuts signal tepid Asian demand\nFor Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) producers, steady prices offered relief amid fiscal pressures, though Saudi price cuts highlighted Asia\u2019s tepid appetite. OPEC+ ministerial talks reaffirmed gradual hikes of 400,000 bpd starting November, aiming to prevent gluts while responding to non-OPEC gains. Russia\u2019s Urals crude traded at $54.92, down amid sanctions, underscoring Europe\u2019s pivot from discounted barrels.\nBroader energy markets mirrored caution: natural gas dipped 2.07 percent to $5.18, gasoline edged up 0.42 percent to $1.84, and heating oil held flat at $2.36. In India, retail petrol and diesel prices remained unchanged despite global fluctuations, unchanged since May 2022 per oil marketing companies. Traders eyed upcoming EIA and OPEC monthly reports for clarity on 2026 balances.\nVolatility expected from Fed decisions and OPEC+ data\nVolatility looms with the Fed decision, OPEC+ data, and Venezuela developments. Escalation in Ukraine or U.S. intervention could spike risk premiums, but robust supply growth\u2014U.S. output at 13.844 million bpd, Saudi at 10 million bpd\u2014poses downside threats. Analysts urged caution, noting overbought signals like Brent\u2019s RSI above 77 in prior sessions.\nMiddle East stakeholders, from Riyadh to Abu Dhabi, navigate these dynamics amid energy transition pushes and AI-driven demand shifts in refining. Oil\u2019s rebound, though modest, signals resilience against headwinds, with weekly closes potentially confirming bullish momentum."

                "body": "Crude oil production in the United States is booming, reports Poten & Partners in its weekly opinion.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil reached 13.8 Million barrels per day (Mb/d) in September 2025, a remarkable recovery since bottoming out in 2008 below 5 Mb/d.\nThe shale oil boom was primarily responsible for this turnaround. The decision to allow crude oil exports from the U.S. at the end of 2015 also contributed, because it made U.S. crude accessible to the international market. This export access converged U.S. oil prices with global benchmarks, narrowing Brent - WTI spreads and boosting domestic production.\nOver the last 10-15 years, shale production in the U.S. has increased rapidly, both in real terms, and as a percentage of total U.S. production. In October 2025, shale output reached 9.04 Mb/d, representing 65% of total U.S. production. As shale production expanded, U.S. crude oil exports followed suit.\nAt the end of 2015, just before the overall ban was lifted, exports were below 500 Kb/d. Since 2023, exports have averaged above 4.0 Mb/d. However, the rapid growth in shale production seems to have leveled off, and export growth has slowed this year as well. Which begs the question: Are we at peak U.S. production (and exports)?\nTo answer the question, we will not only look at shale oil, but also at conventional onshore production as well as offshore U.S. Gulf output. Shale oil has been the engine of U.S. production growth, but over the years there have been ups and downs, driven by external factors (Covid, oil prices, OPEC policies) and changes within the industry. Over time, the shale industry has successfully weathered the storms of low oil prices and demand challenges. Companies have become more efficient, eking out productivity gains from technological advancements like longer lateral wells, enhanced hydraulic fracturing, and digital tools, enabling higher output despite fewer active rigs.\nOver the last five years, the industry has also consolidated through merger and acquisitions. Large companies, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, have acquired smaller independents, and the attention has shifted to shareholder returns rather than growth at all cost. This has reduced production growth, especially in a lower oil price environment.\nHowever, don\u2019t count out shale just yet. As one shale CEO said in a letter to his shareholders: \u201cNever underestimate the American engineer\u201d. Drilling technology continues to improve, and companies keep finding ways to reduce break-even costs. One of the biggest potential advances in shale production could come from increasing the recovery rate. The recovery percentage of shale oil in the U.S. typically ranges from about 5% to 15% of the original oil in place, depending on the specific technology and formation characteristics.\nThe CEO of Chevron recently emphasized that the next phase of the shale revolution is to increase the recovery rate. Every 1%-point increase in the recovery rate is worth billions and according to Chevron: \u201cWe know where the oil is. If we left 90% of the oil behind, it would be the first time in history that we didn't figure out how to do it\u201d.\nShale is not the only area where the U.S. oil industry sees potential. Oil production in the deepwater U.S. Gulf is also on the upswing. Production in the \u201cGulf of America\u201d is close to 2.0 Mb/d and deepwater startups in 2025 are forecast to push production from this area to 2.2 Mb/d in 2026 (an all-time high). Further growth is expected in 2027.\nAnother area that has significant growth potential is Alaska. In their most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA forecasts that crude oil produced from Alaska will reach 477,000 b/d in 2026, a 13% (55,000 b/d) increase from 2025. This is the largest annual increase since the 1980s. Over the next decade, several new projects will come online, boosting production further.

Shale oil has been the engine of U.S. production growth, but over the years there have been ups and downs, driven by external factors (Covid, oil prices, OPEC policies) and changes within the industry. Over time, the shale industry has successfully weathered the storms of low oil prices and demand challenges. Companies have become more efficient, eking out productivity gains from technological advancements like longer lateral wells, enhanced hydraulic fracturing, and digital tools, enabling higher output despite fewer active rigs.\nOver the last five years, the industry has also consolidated through merger and acquisitions. Large companies, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, have acquired smaller independents, and the attention has shifted to shareholder returns rather than growth at all cost. This has reduced production growth, especially in a lower oil price environment.\nHowever, don\u2019t count out shale just yet. As one shale CEO said in a letter to his shareholders: \u201cNever underestimate the American engineer\u201d. Drilling technology continues to improve, and companies keep finding ways to reduce break-even costs. One of the biggest potential advances in shale production could come from increasing the recovery rate. The recovery percentage of shale oil in the U.S. typically ranges from about 5% to 15% of the original oil in place, depending on the specific technology and formation characteristics.\nThe CEO of Chevron recently emphasized that the next phase of the shale revolution is to increase the recovery rate. Every 1%-point increase in the recovery rate is worth billions and according to Chevron: \u201cWe know where the oil is. If we left 90% of the oil behind, it would be the first time in history that we didn't figure out how to do it\u201d.\nShale is not the only area where the U.S. oil industry sees potential. Oil production in the deepwater U.S. Gulf is also on the upswing. Production in the \u201cGulf of America\u201d is close to 2.0 Mb/d and deepwater startups in 2025 are forecast to push production from this area to 2.2 Mb/d in 2026 (an all-time high). Further growth is expected in 2027.\nAnother area that has significant growth potential is Alaska. In their most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA forecasts that crude oil produced from Alaska will reach 477,000 b/d in 2026, a 13% (55,000 b/d) increase from 2025. This is the largest annual increase since the 1980s. Over the next decade, several new projects will come online, boosting production further.

                "body": "Crude oil prices stabilized near two-week peaks on Monday, buoyed by expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut and escalating geopolitical risks in key producing regions. Brent crude futures traded around $63.81 per barrel, up 0.09 percent on the day, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude hovered near $60.16, reflecting a 0.13 percent gain. Despite year-to-date declines of over 11 percent, the benchmarks remained on track for weekly advances, underscoring a fragile balance between supply concerns and demand optimism.\nAnticipation of a Fed rate reduction this week dominated trading sentiment, as lower borrowing costs could spur U.S. economic growth and lift fuel consumption in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer. Markets priced in a high probability of a 25-basis-point cut, potentially easing recession fears and supporting industrial activity. Geopolitical premiums further bolstered prices, with stalled U.S.-Russia talks over Ukraine sustaining sanctions on Moscow\u2019s energy exports and enabling ongoing Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries and pipelines.\nTensions extended to Venezuela, where President Donald Trump\u2019s signals of imminent action raised fears of disruptions to the country\u2019s 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) output, according to Rystad Energy estimates. Ukrainian attacks, including on the Druzhba pipeline, heightened supply risks without immediate flow interruptions, while Russian tanker activity surged amid U.S. sanctions. These factors offset softer elements, positioning oil for its first weekly rise in weeks.\nSupply and demand pressures\nBearish counters capped upside potential. U.S. inventories rose by 574,000 barrels last week per EIA data, alongside gasoline and distillate builds, signaling ample stockpiles. Saudi Arabia slashed its January Arab Light crude price for Asia to a five-year low, reflecting weak regional demand, while Canadian heavy oil weakened. OPEC+ production hikes and surging non-OPEC output from the U.S., Brazil, and Canada fueled oversupply worries, with the IEA forecasting a market surplus next year.\nForecasts varied, with Trading Economics projecting Brent at $64.17 by quarter-end and $69.96 in 12 months, driven by macro models balancing risks. JP Morgan warned of a plunge to the $30s by FY27-end if non-OPEC supply outpaces demand, citing shale expansions and inventory builds.\nRead more: Oil prices fall to $63.21 as market awaits key inflation data ahead of Fed meeting\nSaudi price cuts signal tepid Asian demand\nFor Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) producers, steady prices offered relief amid fiscal pressures, though Saudi price cuts highlighted Asia\u2019s tepid appetite. OPEC+ ministerial talks reaffirmed gradual hikes of 400,000 bpd starting November, aiming to prevent gluts while responding to non-OPEC gains. Russia\u2019s Urals crude traded at $54.92, down amid sanctions, underscoring Europe\u2019s pivot from discounted barrels.\nBroader energy markets mirrored caution: natural gas dipped 2.07 percent to $5.18, gasoline edged up 0.42 percent to $1.84, and heating oil held flat at $2.36. In India, retail petrol and diesel prices remained unchanged despite global fluctuations, unchanged since May 2022 per oil marketing companies. Traders eyed upcoming EIA and OPEC monthly reports for clarity on 2026 balances.\nVolatility expected from Fed decisions and OPEC+ data\nVolatility looms with the Fed decision, OPEC+ data, and Venezuela developments. Escalation in Ukraine or U.S. intervention could spike risk premiums, but robust supply growth\u2014U.S. output at 13.844 million bpd, Saudi at 10 million bpd\u2014poses downside threats. Analysts urged caution, noting overbought signals like Brent\u2019s RSI above 77 in prior sessions.\nMiddle East stakeholders, from Riyadh to Abu Dhabi, navigate these dynamics amid energy transition pushes and AI-driven demand shifts in refining. Oil\u2019s rebound, though modest, signals resilience against headwinds, with weekly closes potentially confirming bullish momentum."

                "body": "WTI crude oil trades with a slight negative bias, easing from an over two-week high reached last Friday. Despite this, geopolitical tensions could restrict Russia\u2019s oil supply, offering support to prices.\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s expected rate cut maintains pressure on the US Dollar, helping prevent larger losses for oil. WTI crude oil prices attempt to sustain a three-week uptrend, hovering just below the $60.00 mark, with a slight decrease of less than 0.10% on Monday.\nImpact of Geopolitical Developments\nDiscussions are underway among the G7 and EU about replacing the current price cap on Russian oil with a maritime services ban. This move could impact Russia\u2019s oil exports and, alongside stalled Russia-Ukraine peace talks, supports oil prices.\nExpectations of a Fed rate cut depress the US Dollar, potentially benefiting dollar-denominated commodities, including crude oil. However, concerns over an anticipated global supply surplus in 2026 may limit gains.\nOPEC\u2019s recent report suggests global oil supply may overtake demand by 2026 due to higher expected output from OPEC+ members. Rising US crude inventories also pose constraints on price increases.\nThe 50-day Simple Moving Average breakout last Friday offers a bullish signal, making any price dip a potential buying opportunity. The overall trend favours an upward movement for WTI crude oil, despite supply concerns.\nMarket Strategies and Federal Reserve Actions\nWith WTI crude oil sitting just below $60, we are seeing conflicting signals that suggest a period of volatility ahead. Geopolitical tensions, particularly the threat of a full maritime services ban on Russian oil, are providing a floor under prices. This uncertainty limits downside risk for now.\nThe potential for new G7 and EU actions against Russian exports is a significant factor we must watch in the coming weeks. We\u2019ve already seen Russian seaborne crude exports drop by about 400,000 barrels per day in November 2025, according to the latest tanker tracking data. Any formal announcement of a ban would sharply curtail supply and could send prices higher.\nAdding to the upward pressure is the expectation of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week. The CME FedWatch Tool is currently pricing in an over 85% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, which would further weaken the US dollar. A softer dollar generally makes oil more affordable for holders of other currencies, which can boost demand.\nHowever, a cap on prices comes from renewed fears of a supply surplus heading into 2026. OPEC\u2019s latest monthly report projects that global supply could exceed demand by over 1.2 million barrels per day by the middle of next year if production increases as planned. This long-term bearish outlook is causing some traders to hesitate.\nWe also have to consider the rising US crude inventories, which are weighing on sentiment. Last week\u2019s report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed a surprise build of 2.4 million barrels, which goes against the typical year-end trend of inventory draws. This pattern is reminiscent of late 2023, when consistent inventory builds prevented prices from sustaining any rally.\nGiven this push and pull, derivative strategies should focus on volatility rather than a single direction over the next few weeks. Options traders might consider straddles or strangles with expirations in January or February 2026 to profit from a significant price move in either direction following the Fed meeting or new geopolitical headlines. The technical breakout above the 50-day moving average suggests buying on dips might be the preferred short-term tactic, but the fundamental supply picture warrants caution."

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair experiences modest gains, trading near 1.1645 during the early Asian session on Monday. Expectations for a US Federal Reserve rate cut in December could influence the US Dollar while supporting the Euro. German Industrial Production and Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence reports are anticipated later.\nInterest Rate Influence\nMarket sentiment shows an 87% likelihood of a 25 basis points rate cut by the Fed, adjusting the federal funds rate to a range of 3.50%-3.75%. Should the Fed implement a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d it may bolster the US Dollar and challenge the EUR/USD pair. Conversely, Eurozone inflation came in slightly higher than projected in November, easing the need for a European Central Bank rate cut.\nThe Euro is the currency for 20 EU nations and ranks second in global trading volume, with EUR/USD being the most traded pair. The European Central Bank oversees monetary policy, aiming for price stability by adjusting rates, which impacts the Euro\u2019s value. Eurozone inflation data is crucial in determining interest rate adjustments.\nEconomic indicators, such as GDP and employment figures, influence the Euro\u2019s strength. A positive Trade Balance, reflecting exports exceeding imports, tends to enhance a currency\u2019s value. Major economies within the Eurozone, including Germany and France, significantly influence the region\u2019s economic standing and the Euro.\nWith the Federal Reserve decision just two days away on Wednesday, December 10th, we see the market has already priced in an 87% chance of a rate cut. This expectation is solidified by recent data, such as the November Non-Farm Payrolls report from last Friday which came in at a disappointing 85,000 jobs, and the October US CPI data showing core inflation softening to 3.1%. The primary focus is therefore not on the cut itself, but on the Fed\u2019s forward guidance.\nMonetary Policy Divergence\nGiven this, we anticipate a rise in implied volatility for EUR/USD options expiring this week. The key risk is a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d where the Fed reduces rates but signals a pause in its easing cycle through its dot plot projections. A sensible strategy would be to use options to position for a larger-than-expected move, as a truly dovish statement could send the pair sharply higher, while a hawkish surprise would reverse recent gains.\nOn the other side of the pair, the European Central Bank appears content to hold its policy rate steady, with its next meeting on December 18th. We note that the latest Eurozone HICP inflation for November 2025 came in at 2.8%, still stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. This policy divergence, with the Fed easing while the ECB holds firm, creates a fundamental tailwind for the Euro.\nThis situation mirrors the divergence we saw begin in 2024, but with the roles reversed. Back then, the ECB was leading the rate-cutting cycle, but now in late 2025, the Fed appears to be the more aggressive easer. Historically, these periods of policy divergence have fueled sustained trends in currency pairs, suggesting further potential strength for the Euro against the Dollar into early 2026."

This subtle rise reflects underlying accumulation ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision on December 11, 2025. Market participants anticipate a 25-basis-point cut, which would bring the federal funds rate to 3.5%\u20133.75%, triggering renewed weakness in the U.S. dollar (USD). The euro (EUR) benefits from regional inflows and improving industrial sentiment in the Eurozone, reinforcing short-term demand between 1.1620\u20131.1650.\nFed Transition and Shifting Power Dynamics\nMarket sentiment is being reshaped by the evolving political and institutional framework within the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure, ending in spring 2026, is already affecting expectations. His likely successor is projected to adopt a more accommodative approach if inflation remains below 2%, marking a decisive shift from Powell\u2019s cautious tone. This has weakened the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) below 99.80, the lowest since September, helping EUR/USD stabilize near 1.1650.\nEuropean Stability and ECB Monetary Posture\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has maintained its deposit rate at 3.75%, while inflation in the eurozone cooled to 2.2% year-over-year, the lowest level in four years. Lower energy costs and reduced import pressure have strengthened the euro\u2019s fundamentals. At the same time, eurozone industrial output rose 0.6% month-over-month, while Germany\u2019s PMI improved to 49.8, showing signs of recovery. The euro\u2019s correlation with the Stoxx 600 Index climbed to 0.73, illustrating stronger investor appetite for European assets as capital rotates out of the U.S.\nTechnical Framework: EUR/USD Key Levels and Momentum\nThe EUR/USD trend remains structurally bullish while price holds above 1.1590, which produced the last major breakout. The pair currently oscillates within a 1.1600\u20131.1700 consolidation zone. A decisive close above 1.1700 could extend the rally toward 1.1740, while a pullback below 1.1590 may lead to profit-taking near 1.1535. The 50-day EMA at 1.1560 continues to support short-term bullish momentum, while algorithmic models identify 1.1668 as the critical pivot for continuation toward 1.1725.\nMacro Divergence and Yield Compression\nRecent U.S. economic indicators confirm a slowdown. Nonfarm Payrolls grew only 142,000, and the unemployment rate increased to 4.1%, its highest since 2021. Meanwhile, U.S. 2-year Treasury yields fell to 4.28%, while German Bunds stabilized around 2.23%, compressing the yield spread to its narrowest in 10 months \u2014 a major bullish catalyst for EUR/USD. In parallel, eurozone current account surpluses have expanded to \u20ac31.5 billion, providing additional currency support through export-backed inflows.\nInstitutional Flows and Derivative Positioning\nCFTC data show net-long euro contracts increasing for a third consecutive week, now totaling +1.07 million, compared to +111,800 the week prior \u2014 a clear sign of institutional accumulation. Option markets reveal dense call positioning above 1.17 for December expiry, reflecting expectations of a controlled upward move.

The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decisions significantly affect its value, aiming for 2% inflation for price stability. Economic data like GDP and the Trade Balance also influence GBP\u2019s direction, as stronger figures generally boost the currency\u2019s value.\nAs of today, December 8, 2025, we see GBP/USD holding around the 1.2850 mark, a noticeable shift from the 1.3330 levels discussed in prior analyses. With both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England set to announce policy decisions next week, traders are showing caution. This reflects a familiar pattern of waiting for central bank guidance before making major moves.\nFed\u2019s Hawkish Outlook\nThe previous expectation of a dovish Federal Reserve has completely reversed by late 2025. With US core inflation holding at 3.1% through November, the Fed is signaling a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 stance to ensure price stability. This hawkish outlook provides underlying support for the US Dollar, capping any significant upside for the GBP/USD pair.\nOn the UK side, the fiscal consolidation measures that Chancellor Reeves introduced back in 2023 have since stabilized government finances, but economic growth has remained sluggish. We just saw Q3 2025 GDP figures come in at a mere 0.1%, while inflation remains sticky at 3.5%. This puts the Bank of England in a difficult position, unable to cut rates to spur growth without risking another inflation surge.\nGiven this dynamic, buying dips in GBP/USD, a strategy that may have worked in the past, now carries more risk. Implied volatility for GBP/USD options expiring after next week\u2019s central bank meetings has already climbed to a three-month high of 9.5%. Traders might consider strategies like purchasing put options to hedge against a potential drop below the 1.2800 support level.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the old resistance at the 100-day SMA near 1.3370 is a distant memory from several years ago. Our focus now is on the 50-day SMA, which is providing firm resistance at the 1.2910 level. The pair\u2019s failure to close above this mark for the past three weeks suggests that sellers currently have the upper hand."

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) remains weak around 98.9\u201399.3, its lowest since May, as the market prices in an 84\u201390% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. Core PCE Price Index rose 0.2% month-on-month and 2.8% year-on-year, confirming disinflation momentum, while the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index surged to 53.3, its strongest level since July. Despite resilient consumer sentiment, the cooling inflation outlook continues to anchor expectations for policy easing.\nFed Pivot and Yield Compression Anchor Pound\u2019s Momentum\nTraders have shifted heavily toward long-sterling exposure as the dollar\u2019s yield advantage narrows. The two-year U.S.\u2013U.K. yield spread has compressed to 23 basis points, the smallest gap since 2021. Derivatives markets confirm the shift: call volumes on sterling have risen 26% week-over-week, and leveraged funds hold 28,000 net long GBP futures contracts, up sharply from 18,000 a month earlier. The conviction is clear \u2014 a dovish Fed is fueling the pound\u2019s upside momentum, especially after a sustained rally from 1.3150 in early November to above 1.3360 now.\nTechnical Structure Suggests Room Toward 1.35\nTechnically, GBP/USD is consolidating just above 1.3330, with near-term resistance at 1.3365 (the 100-day SMA). A confirmed breakout above 1.3365 opens the next resistance zones at 1.3471 and 1.3500, the multi-month ceiling that capped price action throughout Q3 2024. Support lies at 1.3300, 1.3250, and 1.3186. A sustained break below 1.3186 would shift bias to corrective mode, exposing 1.3040 as the deeper retracement area. Indicators favor the bulls \u2014 RSI remains elevated at 61, while the MACD shows widening positive divergence, signaling strong underlying momentum.\nBank of England\u2019s Policy Crossroads\nAcross the Atlantic, the Bank of England (BoE) faces its own policy dilemma. A 25 bps rate cut to 3.75% is expected at the December 18 meeting as officials confront slowing growth and moderating wage pressures. U.K. Q3 GDP rose just 0.1% quarter-over-quarter, while average earnings cooled from 7.7% to 6.9% annually. Despite weaker data, the BoE remains cautious about cutting too aggressively, aware of inflation risks from energy and imported goods. The BoE\u2013Fed divergence remains the key structural driver: with the Fed signaling as much as 100 bps of cumulative cuts by mid-2026, the pound retains a relative yield premium in the near term.\nVolatility and Positioning: Traders Brace for Dual Central Bank Week\nVolatility expectations surged into the final weeks of 2025. The one-week implied volatility for GBP/USD rose to 8.6%, up from 6.1% a week earlier. Traders are positioning for sharp moves around the FOMC and BoE meetings. Options data shows rising bullish exposure \u2014 call spreads targeting 1.3450\u20131.3500 have seen heavy inflows, while short-put writers cluster around 1.3200, betting that the level will hold as firm structural support.\nMacro Correlations Reinforce Sterling\u2019s Lead\nIntermarket relationships confirm the dominance of dollar weakness across G10 pairs. EUR/USD holds firm near 1.1640, while USD/JPY trades around 155.00, reflecting the dollar\u2019s broad retreat. The GBP/USD\u2013DXY correlation remains tightly inverse at \u20130.91, meaning sterling\u2019s trajectory continues to mirror U.S. yield shifts. This alignment highlights how closely "

I should be more excited, but there\u2019s little new to add: the RBA is almost certain to hold, cuts are firmly off the table, and another solid jobs report looks likely. Governor Bullock signalled last week that a hike is possible if inflation stays sticky \u2014 which effectively rules out any move this week given quarterly CPI isn\u2019t released until late January. Ultimately, the Fed meeting remains the bigger driver for the Aussie via the US dollar.\nFed Meeting Remains the Dominant AUD/USD Catalyst\nWhile the soft ADP print revived hopes for more Fed cuts next year, last week\u2019s broader US data doesn\u2019t justify a materially dovish stance. A 25bp cut is expected and likely, but ISM services remains in expansion, consumer sentiment is rising, layoffs are falling and jobless claims beat expectations. That\u2019s not the backdrop for a noticeably dovish dot plot.\nThis is the final FOMC meeting of the year with updated staff projections, and traders will be focused on the 2025 rate path. Fed funds futures price an 86.2% chance of a 25bp cut this week, but only a 40.3% chance of another in April and 32.1% in September. The US dollar will take its lead from the median rate outlook. Three implied cuts would meaningfully pressure the dollar; two still allow December\u2019s usual bearish USD seasonality to play out, while a third would amplify the move.\nAUD/USD Correlations\nCopper continues to show the strongest positive relationship with AUD/USD across the 10-, 20- and 60-day windows. That stands out given the sharp drop in the Aussie\u2013yuan 10-day correlation to 0.37 over the past fortnight. The move is largely explained by the deeply inverted relationship between the US dollar and AUD/USD, sitting at -0.90 on the 10-day and -0.95 on the 20-day lookback.\nRisk appetite remains supportive for the Aussie, with correlations to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones holding near 0.8 on the 10-day window and at least 0.85 on the 20-day. The 60-day correlations also sit just below 0.8.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nBond Yields and Options Flows Continue to Underscore AUD/USD Upside Bias\n- The top panel shows Australian 2-year yields trending higher since July, alongside a widening AU\u2013US 2-year yield spread.

Spot prices currently trade around the 0.6640 region as traders look to China's Trade Balance data for some impetus ahead of this week's key central bank event risks.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Tuesday and is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged and keep focus on taming inflation. In fact, RBA Governor Michele Bullock admitted last week that inflation is not yet sustainably back within the central bank's 2% to 3% annual target band. Furthermore, Australia's economy grew at its fastest annual pace in two years, which, along with a strong labour market, fueled speculations that the RBA will instead hike interest rates next year. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to dovish US Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations, which keeps the US Dollar (USD) bulls on the defensive and acts as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair.\nThe recent US macro data pointed to a gradual cooling of the economy, which, along with comments from several Fed officials, suggests that another interest rate cut in December is all but certain. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, traders are currently pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the US central bank will cut interest rates by 25-basis-points (bps) on Wednesday. Traders, however, opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path before placing fresh directional bets, which, in turn, leads to the AUD/USD pair's subdued price action during the Asian session. Hence, the market focus will remain glued to the updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the post-meeting press conference.\nIn the meantime, China's Trade Balance data could provide some impetus to the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the currency pair. Nevertheless, the aforementioned fundamental backdrop seems tilted firmly in favor of bullish traders and suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair remains to the upside. Hence, any meaningful corrective pullback could be seen as a buying opportunity and is more likely to remain cushioned.\nEconomic Indicator\nTrade Balance CNY\nThe Trade Balance released by the General Administration of Customs of the People\u2019s Republic of China is a balance between exports and imports of total goods and services. A positive value shows trade surplus, while a negative value shows trade deficit. It is an event that generates some volatility for the CNY. As the Chinese economy has influence on the global economy, this economic indicator would have an impact on the Forex market. In general, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) CNY, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish) for the CNY.\nRead more.Next release: Mon Dec 08, 2025 03:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 640.4B\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

A sharp upward revision in the price deflator and accelerating wage growth point to a structural shift away from decades of disinflation. With unions pushing for sizeable pay hikes and markets pricing a near-certain BOJ hike in December, the yen\u2019s bullish tone looks increasingly supported.\nInflation Signals Strengthen Despite GDP Downgrade\nJapan\u2019s economy contracted more sharply than first reported in the September quarter, with GDP falling at an annualised pace of 2.3% compared to the initial 1.8% estimate. The downgrade was driven by weaker capital spending, reversing an earlier estimate of growth, while private consumption saw only a modest lift. Japan\u2019s trade exposure means GDP growth often sees large swings, especially this year with the added layer of rapidly changing U.S. tariff policy. As a result, the latest contraction carries little implication for the BOJ\u2019s near-term policy stance.\nAlongside the growth revision, the implicit price deflator\u2014a broad gauge of economy-wide price pressures\u2014was revised sharply higher to 3.4% from 2.8%, continuing the elevated readings seen over the past two years. This suggests inflationary forces are becoming entrenched, reinforcing signs of a structural shift away from the disinflationary backdrop that has dominated since the early 1990s. If sustained, this trend marks a significant change in Japan\u2019s macro environment.\nSource: LSEG\nWage Growth Adds Momentum\nBuilding on the upward revision in the implicit price deflator, wage data released earlier in the session added further evidence of persistent inflationary pressures. Nominal wages rose 2.6% in October, the fastest pace in three months, supported by gains in base pay, overtime, and bonuses. Regular pay increased 2.6%, while overtime climbed 1.5%, pointing to underlying strength in labour demand. With unions pushing for wage hikes of 5% or more in next year\u2019s spring negotiations, similar to the increases secured over the past two years, it would make the case for sustained inflationary pressures as wage-setting dynamics become further entrenched.\nDespite the acceleration in nominal pay, real wages fell for a tenth consecutive month, sliding 0.7% from a year earlier as consumer prices continued to outpace earnings growth. While purchasing power remains under strain, the persistence of nominal wage growth alongside elevated inflation signals a structural shift in Japan\u2019s economy where wage trends rather than price shocks may increasingly shape policy and investment decisions.\nAs discussed earlier, the downward revision to GDP has not altered market expectations for a BOJ rate hike later this month, with pricing continuing to lean heavily toward a move.\nBOJ Policy Implications\nSource: Bloomberg\nMarket pricing continues to lean heavily toward a rate hike at the BOJ\u2019s December meeting, with overnight index swaps implying a 90% probability of a 25 basis point increase. That confidence has built steadily since Governor Ueda\u2019s hawkish remarks last Monday, marking a clear shift in expectations for near-term policy.\nSource: LSEG\nFurther out, Japanese five-year OIS now trades at 1.383%, almost double where it began the year. This measure reflects the average level markets expect overnight interest rates to hold over the next five years, making it a useful gauge of medium-term policy expectations. The sharp rise underscores growing conviction that the BOJ will move away from its ultra-loose stance and normalise policy over time. The hawkish repricing has combined with increased JGB issuance to fund the government\u2019s latest stimulus package, pushing yields higher across the curve in recent months.\nAs outlined in my week-ahea"

                "body": "USD/JPY took the spotlight early in the Monday, December 8, session, as crucial Japanese economic data fueled speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike.\nWage growth and finalized Q3 GDP numbers supported market bets on a December BoJ hike, boosting demand for the Japanese yen. The USD/JPY pair retreated on the stronger yen.\nRising expectations of a BoJ rate hike have coincided with bets on a December Fed rate cut, opening the door to heightened volatility as key data rolls out. This morning\u2019s data supported a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY, hinging on dovish Fed and hawkish BoJ rate paths.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nAverage cash earnings increased 2.6% year-on-year (YoY) in October, up from 2.1% in September. Overtime pay rose from 1% YoY to 1.5% in October. A pickup in wages is crucial for the BoJ hawks, looking to advance monetary policy normalization.\nHigher wages increase household purchasing power, boost consumer spending, and fuel demand-driven inflation. Furthermore, an upswing in household spending would bolster the economy, given that private consumption accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nLast week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled an imminent rate hike, citing wage growth, underscoring the importance of household purchasing power on the Bank\u2019s policy stance.\nUSD/JPY responded, briefly falling from 155.285 to 155.240 after the data.\nWhile wage growth lifted bets on a December BoJ rate hike, finalized Q3 GDP data offered the BoJ doves an argument to delay a policy adjustment until January. The economy contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, revised from a preliminary 0.5% contraction. However, the downward revision to headline GDP stemmed from a 0.2% QoQ fall in capital expenditure. According to the preliminary report, capital expenditure had risen 0.4% QoQ.\nTwo components drew significant interest, given BoJ Governor Ueda\u2019s recent comments on easing tariff risk and rising wages:\nMarkets will likely discount the drop in external demand (though unchanged), given that the US administration lowered tariffs on Japanese goods from 25% to 15% in the quarter and BoJ Governor Ueda\u2019s recent comments.\nLooking at the one-minute chart, the pair briefly rose to a high of 155.381 before sliding to a low of 155.165 after the finalized GDP report. USD/JPY price action showed market sentiment toward higher wages and the upward revision to private consumption.\nWhile expectations of a BoJ rate hike are strengthening yen demand, key US data will fuel speculation about multiple Fed rate cuts.\nLater on Monday, US economic data will influence USD/JPY trends as the FOMC interest rate decision and projections loom. Economists expect Consumer Inflation Expectations to soften from 3.2% in October to 3.1% in November.\nA drop in the NY Fed 1-Year Consumer Inflation Expectations would align with last week\u2019s inflation data, supporting bets on a Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed rate path would weaken demand for the US dollar, sending USD/JPY lower, aligning with my bearish short- to medium-term outlook.\nFor context, the US Core PCE Price Index rose 2.8% YoY in September, down from 2.9%, while Michigan Inflation Expectations fell from 4.5% in November to 4.1% in December.\nThe prospect of a December Fed rate cut, further easing in H1 2026, and BoJ rate hikes are key for USD/JPY trends.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December cut stood at 88.4% on December 8, up from 86.2% on December 5. Meanwhile, the chances of a March rate cut slipped from 46.5% to 46.1%.\nWith markets already pricing in a December cut, traders should closely monitor the chances of a March cut.\nWhile key US inflation data will influence US dollar demand, there are no FOMC member speeches to overshadow the reports. The Fed\u2019s Blackout Period is in effect until December 11, limiting Fed-driven volatility.\nLooking at the dai"

The Loonie pair fell drastically on Friday after the release of the Canadian labor market report for November, which showed that the Unemployment Rate dropped significantly to 6.5% from 6.9% in October due to a significant increase in part-time workers.\nFull-time jobs created by the Canadian economy in November were 53.6K, slightly lower than 66.6K in October, while economists anticipated that employers would have shed 5K jobs.\nStrong Canadian employment data has diminished hopes of an interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) for the monetary policy scheduled on Wednesday. The BoC is expected to hold interest rates steady at 2.25%.\nHowever, the uncertainty over trade relations between the United States (US) and Canada still remains a major hang for the Canadian Dollar.

If the BoC believes inflation will be above target (hawkish), it will raise interest rates in order to bring it down. This is bullish for the CAD since higher interest rates attract greater inflows of foreign capital. Likewise, if the BoC sees inflation falling below target (dovish) it will lower interest rates in order to give the Canadian economy a boost in the hope inflation will rise back up. This is bearish for CAD since it detracts from foreign capital flowing into the country.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Dec 10, 2025 14:45\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 2.25%\nPrevious: 2.25%\nSource: Bank of Canada\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

                "body": "The coming week is one of the most important of the year for macro traders. Between 8 and 15 December 2025, four major central banks meet, China releases fresh trade and inflation data, and Europe and the UK publish key inflation and growth numbers. All of it lands against a backdrop of moderating but still\u2011sticky global inflation and mounting political pressure for easier policy. [1]\nBelow is a detailed, day\u2011by\u2011day guide to the global economic calendar, plus the latest forecasts and market narratives as of 7 December 2025.\nBig picture: Why this week matters\n- Policy turning point: The US Federal Reserve, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Bank of Canada (BoC) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) all meet within three days. Markets see the Fed delivering another 25\u2011bp cut while the others mostly hold. [2]\n- Inflation near targets, but not quite \u201csolved\u201d:\n- US CPI is running around 3% year\u2011on\u2011year and the Fed\u2019s preferred PCE gauge around 2.8%, both above target but far from 2022\u2019s peaks. [3]\n- Eurozone inflation ticked up to 2.2% in November, \u201cpractically at target,\u201d in the words of ECB policymaker Joachim Nagel. [4]\n- Germany\u2019s flash HICP for November printed 2.6%, with the final estimate due on Friday. [5]\n- Growth is lukewarm: UK GDP shrank 0.1% in September, and October\u2019s data (out Friday) are expected to show near\u2011stagnation. [6]\n- Politics is reshaping inflation: Tariff policy, particularly in the US and between the EU and China, is now a key driver of inflation and trade flows, adding to the stakes around China\u2019s trade and price data early in the week. [7]\nIn short: rates are no longer rising aggressively, but central banks are far from declaring victory. This week\u2019s decisions and data will help determine how fast\u2014if at all\u2014policy can ease in 2026.\nThe main events: Four big central\u2011bank meetings\n1. US Federal Reserve (FOMC) \u2013 Wednesday 10 December\n- What: FOMC rate decision, Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference\n- When: Statement and SEP at 14:00 ET; Powell at 14:30 ET (Wednesday US time) [8]\n- Current policy: Federal funds target range 3.75\u20134.00% after an October cut. [9]\n- Market pricing: About an 80\u201385% implied probability of another 25\u2011bp cut to 3.50\u20133.75%. [10]\nThe Fed\u2019s internal divisions, rather than the move itself, are the real story. At least five of the twelve voting FOMC members have publicly questioned the need for further cuts, while three Board governors actively support one. Three or more dissents would be the largest split since 2019. [11]\nComplicating the Fed\u2019s job is a data backlog caused by a 43\u2011day government shutdown, which has delayed the November jobs report until after the meeting. Jobless claims have fallen to their lowest level in over three years, suggesting the labour market is softening but far from collapsing. [12]\nWhat to watch in the Fed decision\n- The vote tally:\n- A narrow vote with multiple dissents would signal deep disagreement and could make future cuts harder to deliver.\n- The new \u201cdot plot\u201d:\n- The SEP is likely to show only limited further easing in 2026, consistent with the OECD\u2019s view that rate\u2011cutting cycles in major economies will largely end by 2026. [13]\n- Powell\u2019s tone on tariffs and inflation:\n- Tariffs have pushed parts of US inflation above 3%, even as overall CPI and PCE hover near 3%. Powell\u2019s comments on how durable this pressure is could move both the dollar and the long end of the Treasury curve. [14]\nFor markets, a \u201ccut\u2011with\u2011hawkish\u2011guidance\u201d mix is the base case. A larger\u2011than\u2011expected bloc of hawkish dissents, or strong language about keeping rates higher for longer, would be dollar\u2011positive and negative for rate\u2011sensitive equities.\n2. Reserve Bank of Australia \u2013 Tuesday 9 December\n- What: Cash\u2011rate decision and Governor\u2019s statement\n- When: 14:30 Sydney time; next scheduled update on the RBA\u2019s website is explicitly set for 9 December 2025. [15]\n- Current policy: Cash rate 3.60% since November. [16]\n- Consensus: A firm hold at 3.6"

                "body": "This is the article content.\nThe Bitcoin ETP Revolution\nPicture this: the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) marks a seismic shift in how we perceive cryptocurrency, carving a path for Bitcoin to stride confidently into the realm of mainstream finance. As institutional players pile into the Bitcoin frenzy, its identity as a commodity becomes clearer, elegantly separating it from the tumultuous realm of altcoins swamped by regulatory fog. This critical juncture paints a portrait of cautious optimism for Bitcoin, but it\u2019s not a wild free-for-all into the crypto ocean; rather, we witness a meticulous weaving together of traditional and digital finance amidst the haze of uncertainty.\nThe SEC's Guarded Approach to Crypto Governance\nEnter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as it boldly asserts its authority over cryptocurrency regulation with a calculated, almost surgical precision. Under Gary Gensler's stewardship, the SEC's endorsement of Bitcoin ETPs has emerged alongside a strict set of conditions designed to carve out a regulated sanctuary for crypto-compliant behavior. Despite popular belief that the SEC is throwing open the gates for crypto, Gensler reveals an underlying trepidation: a staggering number of digital assets are devoid of inherent value. In this high-stakes environment, Bitcoin shines as a model of compliance, distinctly distancing itself from the vast majority of altcoins that languish in regulatory limbo.\nInstitutional Investment: A Tipping Point\nThe arrival of Bitcoin ETPs doesn't just stir the pot; it heralds a transformative epoch for institutional investment. Major asset managers are now exploring these regulated instruments as a means to hedge against the unpredictable tides of the digital currency seas. Bitcoin ETPs serve as a bridge, linking the solid ground of traditional markets to the electrifying waters of cryptocurrencies. However, this carefully orchestrated acceptance raises eyebrows about the survival prospects of altcoins, whose turbulent nature might dissuade risk-averse investors seeking a haven of stability. The question looms large: can altcoins ever find their footing in such a rigorously regulated playground?\nMarket Integrity Through Regulatory Scrutiny\nGensler emphasizes that regulation within the crypto sphere transcends mere compliance; it\u2019s about safeguarding the very fabric of market integrity. The SEC's relentless vigilance significantly influences the entry of new tokens, many of which it views as potential unregistered securities. This approach cultivates a market that bifurcates, allowing Bitcoin to bask in its regulatory clarity while myriad altcoins grapple for breath. The SEC\u2019s intervention bolsters Bitcoin's legitimacy, positioning it favorably in the eyes of wary investors, while the struggle for acceptance continues to plague altcoins.\nThe Altcoin Quagmire\nWhile Bitcoin savors its newfound regulatory approval, altcoins are ensnared in a labyrinth of challenges that their leading counterpart seems to evade effortlessly. The SEC\u2019s unwavering focus illuminates the inherent risks that alternative tokens face, hindering their ability to establish themselves within mainstream finance. Absent robust regulatory pathways, these altcoins fumble for legitimacy and funding, stifling the birth of potential innovations that might disrupt the financial landscape as we know it.\nProject Crypto: Catalyzing Change\nIn this landscape, Project Crypto emerges as a potential game-changer, championed by former SEC Chair Paul Atkins. This ambitious initiative seeks to rejuvenate financial regulations by embracing the integration of blockchain technology and tokenization into existing systems. By focusing on tokenization rather than a full-scale shift towards cryptocurrencies, Project Crypto fosters innovation while maintaining a strong tether to compliance standards. As such initiatives take root, they harbor the seeds of broader acceptance for digital assets, potenti"

                "url": "https://beincrypto.com/bittensor-tao-halving-december-2025-analysis/",
                "body": "Bittensor (TAO) is days away from its first-ever halving as the decentralized AI network nears the 10.5 million TAO supply mark. Scheduled on or around December 14, the event will cut daily token issuance by half.\nThis halving marks a pivotal point for Bittensor, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) emission reduction model. While experts expect the event to trigger a positive price reaction, others warn of a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\nSponsoredBittensor Halving Mechanics and Supply Dynamics\nBittensor has a fixed supply cap of 21 million TAO, designed to create scarcity similar to Bitcoin. According to the latest data from Taostats, the circulating supply has reached 10,451,753 TAO, nearing the halving threshold.\nThis event will reduce daily emissions from 7,200 TAO to 3,600 TAO, impacting rewards for miners, validators, and subnet owners. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s time-based schedule, Bittensor\u2019s halving activates when the circulating supply hits 10.5 million tokens.\nMiner registration, network activity shifts, and the introduction of Alpha tokens can affect the timing, so the exact date is flexible. Furthermore, Subnet Alpha tokens, introduced in February 2025, follow the same emission schedule.\nWhy the Halving Matters\nHalvings are typically considered bullish catalysts because they slow the rate at which new tokens enter circulation. Historical examples across Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) show that markets often respond with anticipatory rallies driven by tightening supply dynamics and trader psychology. While outcomes vary, the narrative around scarcity tends to shape sentiment in the lead-up to emission cuts.\nGrayscale\u2019s Research Analyst Will Ogden Moore emphasized the long-term impact of this structural shift. He noted that reduced emissions naturally increase scarcity and can reinforce network value over time.\nSponsoredThe analyst also pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory through four halvings, during which the asset\u2019s market value and network security continued to strengthen even as miner rewards declined. According to Moore, Bittensor\u2019s inaugural halving represents a comparable milestone. This signals the maturing of the protocol as it progresses toward its fixed 21 million TAO cap.\n\u201cThe early success of certain subnet-based applications and an increase in institutional capital in the Bittensor ecosystem, combined with the forthcoming TAO supply halving, could be a positive catalyst for price, in our view,\u201d Moore added.\nTAO Technical Outlook and Market Sentiment\nDespite this, market sentiment regarding TAO sentiment remains cautious. An analyst stressed that, although the halving will enhance TAO\u2019s long-term scarcity, the event itself is unlikely to spark an immediate price rally.\n\u201cI am not expecting TAO to move on the halving event. Over time, increased scarcity will matter.. as it has for Bitcoin every four years But.. I don\u2019t see it being an important catalyst to price in the short term That said.. it is a major moment in the Bittensor journey,\u201d the post read.\nAnother trader warned of a possible \u201csell the news\u201d event as the halving approaches. He noted that TAO has already slipped below a key support zone and faced a sharp rejection during an attempted reclaim, signalling weakening bullish momentum.\n\u201cI warned of a potential sell the news event, and it is looking more likely that is the case\u2026.The 3 day zone I highlighted has been lost, and we have just seen an aggressive rejection on the reclaim attempt. If $300 now continues as resistance I think this very likely retraces to $230, and I would not be surprised to see it below $200 either,\u201d the analyst stated.\nMeanwhile, BeInCrypto Markets data showed that TAO has slipped nearly 28% over the past month. However, it has seen modest gains of 5.2% over the past week.\nAt the time of writing, the altcoin traded at $288.33, up 1.83% over the past day. Now, whether the halving event will reinforce the broader weakness or help boost market sentiment will become clearer in the da"

                "body": "By allowing people to lock in future gas prices. the system could help traders, developers, and institutions hedge against volatility and better plan operational expenses. The idea comes as Ethereum\u2019s fees, while currently low, continue to swing sharply. Buterin argues that a futures market will not only smooth out these fluctuations but also provide clearer signals about long-term fee expectations.\nButerin Proposes New Way to Stabilize Gas Fees\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin caused fresh discussions about the future of network fees after proposing the creation of a trustless on-chain futures market for gas. The idea was shared in a post on X,and came in response to questions about whether Ethereum can guarantee low and predictable gas fees as adoption scales. Buterin argued that while ongoing roadmap improvements aim to reduce costs, users, developers, and institutions need greater certainty about what they will pay to transact in the months and years ahead.\nHis proposed solution is similar to how traditional futures markets operate. In commodities like oil, futures contracts let buyers and sellers lock in prices at a later date, reducing uncertainty and helping manage risk. An Ethereum gas futures market would adopt the same principle.\nUsers could secure a set base fee for a defined future time window, effectively locking in the price of blockspace before they need it. This could allow high-volume users like traders, app developers, and institutions to hedge against volatility and plan operational expenses more accurately.\nButerin explained that such a market would do more than protect against spikes. It would also offer a reliable metric for the ecosystem to understand expectations around future gas costs. This transparency could support better long-term planning for everything from protocol development to application design. A well-functioning on-chain futures system would, in his view, serve as a core financial tool for Ethereum\u2019s maturing economy.\nThe proposal arrives at a moment when Ethereum gas fees have fallen a lot throughout 2025. Basic transactions currently average around 0.474 gwei, or roughly one cent, according to Etherscan. More complex operations, like token swaps, NFT sales, or bridging assets, cost between $0.05 and $0.27. Despite the overall downtrend, fee levels have stayed unstable.\nYTD ETH gas prices (Source: Ycharts)\nData from Ycharts shows that average transaction fees started the year at $1, dipped to $0.18 at their lowest, and spiked to $2.60 at times before settling close to $0.30. For Buterin, this volatility proves why a futures market could become essential infrastructure for Ethereum."

Data from Ycharts shows that the average fee started the year at $1 and has since declined to $0.30, with surges to as high as $2.60 and crashes to as low as $0.18 along the way."

                "body": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is promoting a new mechanism to mitigate sudden spikes in transaction costs on the network.\nHis latest proposal outlines a trustless, on-chain prediction market designed to help users secure future gas prices and manage volatility rather than react to it.\nButerin Backs Ethereum Gas Pricing Market\nOn December 6, Buterin argued that Ethereum needs a market-based signal for future demand for block space.\nThe structure would trade exposure to the network\u2019s Base Fee by letting participants buy or sell gas commitments tied to a future window.\nAccording to him, the aim is to give developers and heavy users a way to lock in costs and plan even when the spot price of gas remains low.\nThe proposal comes at an unusual time, as gas prices are near multi-year lows.\nEtherscan data shows that Ethereum's average gas price is about 0.468 Gwei, or roughly three cents. This is because much of the network\u2019s retail activity has shifted to cheaper Layer 2 networks like Base and Arbitrum.\nYet, Buterin argues that current tranquility breeds complacency.\nHe stresses that an on-chain futures curve would provide a clear signal of long-term market expectations. It would permit users to prepay for block space and lock in costs regardless of future spikes.\n\"People would get a clear signal of people's expectations of future gas fees, and would even be able to hedge against future gas prices, effectively prepaying for any specific quantity of gas in a specific time interval,\" he stated.\nIndustry Experts Throw in Views\nSupporters see the proposal as an underappreciated pillar of Ethereum\u2019s long-term design. They argue that a trustless gas futures market would fill a structural gap rather than introduce another DeFi novelty.\nIn their view, a BASEFEE market would align expectations with transparent pricing and provide the ecosystem with a shared reference point for future network conditions.\nSo, a liquid market for gas exposure could change this dynamic by allowing developers to buy gas insurance to cap operating costs ahead of critical events. Heavy users could also offset future fee spikes by taking the opposite market position.\n\"If Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for everything, then gas itself becomes a financial asset. So yeah a trustless gas futures market isn\u2019t a \u201cnice to have.\u201d It feels like a natural evolution for a chain aiming for global-scale coordination,\" the analyst stated.\nMeanwhile, one industry advisor at Titan Builder noted that running this as a classic derivative market would be difficult because validators could manipulate outcomes by producing empty blocks."

                "body": "As 2025 draws to a close, Solana (SOL) finds itself at a crucial crossroads, shaped by both global economic trends and significant upgrades to its blockchain infrastructure. The platform\u2019s future performance will depend on how effectively it adapts to changes in monetary policy and leverages its technical advancements. This overview explores the combined impact of these elements, referencing recent industry reports and institutional perspectives.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to monetary policy in the latter part of 2025 has played a pivotal role in influencing Solana\u2019s market behavior. With the Fed adopting a more accommodative stance\u2014halting interest rate increases and signaling a return to quantitative easing in early 2026\u2014liquidity has flowed into riskier assets, boosting demand for cryptocurrencies such as SOL.\nIndustry analysis highlights that the Fed\u2019s rate reduction in October 2025 prompted a surge in institutional investment. Notably, the Bitwise Solana ETF (BSOL) attracted $417 million in its initial phase, reflecting a broader trend of crypto assets being embraced as diversification tools, especially as traditional bond yields remain low.\nDespite these positive developments, uncertainty around monetary policy continues to fuel volatility. For example, a 14% decline in Solana\u2019s price in early November 2025 was linked to forced liquidations caused by delays in anticipated rate cuts and concerns over ongoing quantitative tightening. Nonetheless, historical patterns indicate that lower interest rates tend to make non-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, a trend that was evident as Solana\u2019s value climbed during the Fed\u2019s gradual rate reductions in 2024 and 2025.\nInstitutional involvement has further strengthened Solana\u2019s resilience to macroeconomic shifts. The introduction of regulated investment vehicles, such as the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, brought in $421 million in late 2025, underscoring confidence in Solana\u2019s long-term prospects. These moves are part of a larger wave of crypto integration into mainstream finance, including retirement plans and exchange-traded products.\nSolana\u2019s technological progress in 2025 has solidified its reputation as a high-speed blockchain capable of rivaling established financial systems. The rollout of the Firedancer validator client and the Alpenglow consensus protocol has dramatically improved both scalability and efficiency. Firedancer, for instance, has slashed validator costs by 80% and diversified the network\u2019s validator ecosystem, enhancing overall stability. Meanwhile, Alpenglow\u2019s streamlined voting system has reduced block finality times to as little as 100\u2013150 milliseconds, paving the way for real-time applications and high-frequency trading.\nThese upgrades are integral to Solana\u2019s broader ambition to become a dominant force in global finance. By the end of 2025, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance reached $10.2 billion, supported by strategic collaborations such as those with Western Union for international payments. Developer participation has also soared, with over 17,700 active contributors utilizing innovative tools like Pinocchio and Token Extensions to drive further growth.\nMarket indicators point to a positive outlook for Solana. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has found support near $133, and technical signals\u2014including the TD Sequential buy indicator and rising On-Balance Volume (OBV)\u2014suggest potential gains toward the $150\u2013$165 range by year\u2019s end. Past events, such as the 400% rally following the Token-22 upgrade in 2024, reinforce this optimistic perspective.\nWhile Solana\u2019s advancements on both the technical and institutional fronts enhance its durability, certain risks remain. Persistent inflation or a shift in the Fed\u2019s policy direction could dampen appetite for risk assets. Additionally, although upgrades like Firedancer have strengthened the network, vulnerabilities could still pose challenges to long-term stabil"

Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s conclusion of its multi-year quantitative tightening (QT) program, global liquidity dynamics have shifted decisively. The Fed\u2019s transition toward easing \u2014 after maintaining restrictive policy between 2023 and mid-2025 \u2014 has begun injecting liquidity back into markets. This shift historically benefits risk assets, especially those with strong transactional ecosystems like Solana.\nDuring the QT phase, the crypto sector lost an estimated 15% of total market value, with liquidity constrained and speculative flows diverted toward Bitcoin and stablecoins. Solana\u2019s ecosystem, heavily dependent on capital efficiency and on-chain throughput, saw trading volatility surge while institutional inflows dried up. However, as of December 2025, post-QT liquidity injections have turned net-positive, producing the first expansionary macro environment since early 2022. This shift aligns with Solana\u2019s recent stabilization above $132 and the reduction in downside momentum after weeks of heavy selling.\nStructural Market Compression Around $132 Reflects Indecision Before Breakout\nSolana\u2019s price has consolidated tightly between $130 and $145, reflecting a market in equilibrium following months of volatility. The SOL-USD pair currently trades near $135.66, up 2.7% daily, as buyers defend a critical horizontal range that defines the lower boundary of its multi-month trading structure.\nThe chart shows a pattern of narrowing volatility, with volumes dropping 18% week-over-week. The Stochastic RSI sits in an oversold recovery phase, and the MACD histogram has converged toward neutral \u2014 both suggesting that momentum selling is losing intensity.\nTraders identify the $124\u2013$130 zone as Solana\u2019s structural pivot. Each approach toward this band since 2023 has generated rebounds of 30\u201345%, confirming its role as the backbone of the long-term uptrend. Market depth data indicates large resting bids between $125 and $127, reinforcing the probability of stabilization if the range is retested.\nDescending Wedge and Historical Trendline Define the Long-Term Setup\nAnalysts following high-timeframe structures describe Solana as moving within a descending wedge formation anchored around $128\u2013$130. The wedge has guided all major corrections since early 2024, with repeated tests of its lower band. The upper boundary near $150\u2013$155 marks the inflection zone that could confirm a new breakout if reclaimed with volume.\nPrice currently rests on the same diagonal trendline that supported every major recovery since 2023, including rebounds from $8 in late 2022, $21 in mid-2023, and $65 in early 2024. A clean bounce from this structure would sustain the long-term bullish trajectory toward $180\u2013$200. Failure to hold this zone would expose deeper retracements to $120 and potentially $108, the next liquidity shelf.\nShort Liquidations and Revolut Adoption Reignite Confidence\nThe latest rebound above $140 was fueled by $60 million in short liquidations across Solana-native perpetual platforms within 24 hours, according to SolanaFloor. This liquidation cluster flushed out excessive leverage and reset open interest, allowing price to stabilize under healthier market conditions.\nAt the same time, a major adoption catalyst arrived from Revolut, Europe\u2019s largest neobank with 65 million users, which integrated Solana payments, staking, and transfers. This move expands retail accessibility and on-ramps institutional flows into the Solana network, ali"

That was one of the last major economic releases ahead of the Fed's policy gathering taking place this week.\nTraders have grown increasingly hopeful over recent weeks that the Fed will lower interest rates at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is the final one of the year. Fed funds futures are pricing in a roughly 88% chance of a decrease, up from under 67% a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\"Markets are appropriately focused on an interest rate cut or hold coming out of ... [the] FOMC meeting,\" Eric Freedman, Northern Trust's chief investment officer for wealth management, wrote to clients. But, \"investors are perhaps more interested in dynamics surrounding voting-member outlooks and future Fed leadership.\"\nThere is no economic data of note due Monday, but the New York Fed is releasing its survey of consumer expectations in the morning. Investors will keep an eye on earnings from companies such as Lululemon, Costco, Broadcom, Oracle and Adobe slated for this week.\nCRH, Carvana and Comfort Systems will join the S&P 500 beginning Dec. 22, S&P Global announced Friday.\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH, the Irish materials maker, jumped more than 6% in extended trading. Shares of used car sales platform Carvana and HVAC provider Comfort Systems added more than 9% and 1%, respectively.\nS&P Global said the trio would replace LKQ, Solstice Advanced Materials and Mohawk Industries.\n\u2014 Alex Harring\nFutures tied to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 all traded around flat shortly after 6 p.m. ET Sunday night.\n\u2014 Alex Harring"

The closure was first reported by the Mail on Sunday.\nThe entrepreneur warned earlier this year that costs for milk powder, cocoa, electricity and staff had increased so much that he was failing to make money.\nNews of the closure comes as businesses reel from the impact of Labour\u2019s Budget. Companies cut jobs at the fastest pace since July 2021 last month as they battled rising labour costs.\nBusinesses had repeatedly warned of job losses after Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, raised employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions in her maiden Budget last year, alongside increases in the minimum wage.\nAround 3,500 retail properties will also pay an extra \u00a3112m in business rates from next April as a result of changes announced in Ms Reeves\u2019s second Budget last month, according to tax consultants Ryan. The British Independent Retailers Association estimates that a typical shop owner will see their bill rise by 15pc next year.\nIt has sparked warnings that Britain\u2019s high streets risk being further hollowed out in the coming years as more firms go bust."

                "body": "The U.S. Navy released summaries for four separate investigations into incidents that involved the USS Harry S. Truman between December 2024 and May 2025.\nThe investigation looked into the Truman\u2019s collision with a merchant vessel, along with the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornets.\n\u201cThese investigations assessed underlying procedural compliance and standards and reviewed how a Carrier Strike Group prepares for and responds to adversity during combat operations,\u201d the investigation summary read.\nVice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby vowed that the service would learn from the incidents, especially in light of the investigation\u2019s findings.\nKilby added that the Navy would continue to invest in its service members to ensure they were ready for future challenges.\nThe USS Harry S. Truman collided with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12 near Port Said, Egypt. No injuries or flooding were reported.\nRELATED\nShortly after, the service relieved Capt. Dave Snowden, commanding officer of the USS Harry S. Truman, due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.\nThe investigation found that the collision was avoidable and that the \u201ccarrier\u2019s bridge team failed to safely navigate past the merchant vessel.\u201d\nRegarding the collision, the incident \u201ccould have caused catastrophic results,\u201d the report concluded.\nBetween December 2024 and May 2025, the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group was plagued with errors involving jets that each costs approximately $60 million.\nThe USS Gettysburg shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet in December 2024 in an act of friendly fire, an F/A-18F Super Hornet attempting to land on the USS Harry S. Truman in May toppled overboard and an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet fell off the hangar deck of the Truman in April.\nThe investigation found that the friendly fire incident resulted from misidentification that stemmed from a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d\nThe April incident in which the jet and a tow tractor fell from Truman\u2019s hangar bay occurred as a result of evasive maneuvers in response to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the summary stated. The investigation attributed the jet\u2019s loss to an aircraft brake system failure, as well as poor communication between the bridge, flight deck control and hangar bay control.\nThe investigation further found that the failed landing of an F/A-18 that forced two pilots to eject in May arose from a failure of the #4 arresting wire aboard Truman that resulted from \u201ca malfunctioning #4 starboard sheave damper.\u201d\nThe report also cited inadequate maintenance practices, low manning levels, limited knowledge, insufficient training, high operational tempo and combat conditions as catalysts for the incident.\nRiley Ceder is a reporter at Military Times, where he covers breaking news, criminal justice, investigations, and cyber. He previously worked as an investigative practicum student at The Washington Post, where he contributed to the Abused by the Badge investigation."

                "body": "Japan's Nikkei edges lower, big tech shares drag amid valuation worries\nBy Kevin Buckland\nJapan's Nikkei share average edged lower on Monday, weighed by tech stocks amid continued investor caution about sky-high valuations for artificial intelligence-related shares.\nAt the same time, a more stable yen after a bout of strength in recent weeks supported the broader market, even with rising market bets for a Bank of Japan interest rate hike next week. Gains for Wall Street on Friday provided an additional tailwind.\nThe Nikkei NI225 declined less than 0.1% to 50,473.84 as of the midday recess. The broader Topix TOPIX, by contrast, added 0.4% to 3,376.43.\nThe biggest drag on the Nikkei was startup investor SoftBank Group 9984, shaving 93 points from the index with a 2.5% slide. Next was chip-testing equipment maker Advantest 6857, which fell 0.9%, followed by chip-making machinery manufacturer Tokyo Electron 8035, which lost 1%, subtracting a combined 79 points from the index.\n\"There's a sense of overheating in high-tech stocks, making them susceptible to selling pressure,\" said Fumika Shimizu, an equities strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\"The underlying trend of falling tech stocks remains intact.\"\nOverall, though, winners vastly outnumbered losers on the Nikkei, with 162 of its 225 components rising, 59 falling, and four trading flat.\nThe index rose to a record high of 52,636.87 in early November before succumbing to profit-taking, centered on AI-related shares.\n\"The Nikkei feels heavy,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.\n\"For the time being, I expect stocks to trade sideways. A rise from here would come with high risk.\"\nDespite the fall in chip-related shares, stocks tied to expectations of increased demand for data centers were among the top performers on the Nikkei. Fujikura 5803 soared 5.7% and Fuji Electric 6504 jumped 4.1%.\nThe best-performing sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry groups was real estate RE, which climbed 2.6%.\nBanking TTOPIXB lost 0.7% to be the bottom performer, but that was after rising to the highest level since 1999 last week on expectations the BOJ will resume hiking rates."

SoftBank Group led the fall with a 2.5% drop, weighing on the index, while high-valuation chip and AI names like Advantest and Tokyo Electron also declined, knocking off 79 points from the Nikkei. That said, the broader market showed underlying strength: 162 out of 225 stocks actually gained on the day, helped by a rally in real estate stocks and solid results from firms like Fujikura and Fuji Electric riding the data center boom. A steady yen and positive sentiment from Wall Street offered some support, but caution is growing, with market strategists flagging the risk of overheating in certain tech segments and predicting sideways trading ahead.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tech fatigue cools the rally.\nProfit-taking in major AI-focused stocks is tapping the brakes on a red-hot sector and casting doubt on whether tech valuations can keep rising after such big leaps. Real estate shares are stepping up as the new source of momentum, balancing out the market as money shifts to less stretched sectors. This rotation may keep the Nikkei\u2019s short-term moves in check, with many investors taking a cautious approach after recent surges.\nThe bigger picture: Rotation highlights broader caution.\nInvestors piling into real estate suggests a search for stability and diversification away from overheated tech names. Muted moves in banking stocks\u2014even as market watchers expect a possible Bank of Japan rate hike\u2014add another layer of hesitation. Altogether, Japan\u2019s market is echoing global trends: investors are tiptoeing toward safer, value-driven plays, aware of the risks tied to interest rate shifts and a still-sensitive currency.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nReda Farran, CFA \u2022 4 days ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
