The practice dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, during the German economic miracle. Currently, half the reserves are held domestically at the Bundesbank, with the rest in New York and London. Between 2013 and 2017, Germany already repatriated part of its reserves from New York and Paris.\nGermany and Italy together hold $245 billion in gold in Federal Reserve vaults.

                "body": "The relationship between gold prices and the dollar: Everything to know\nInvestors have long viewed gold as a steady hedge during periods of economic uncertainty, but its role in today's markets is evolving rapidly. Recent shifts in monetary policy, stubborn inflation risks and rising geopolitical tensions have all reshaped how investors think about safety, value and long-term protection, and have pushed traditional market relationships to their limits.\nAgainst that backdrop, gold's recent price behavior has been anything but ordinary. After breaking through key price thresholds in 2024 and 2025 \u2014 first $3,000 per ounce, then $4,000 \u2014 the price of the precious metal has continued climbing in 2026, recently surpassing $4,600 per ounce and setting a string of new all-time highs. What once looked like a cyclical upswing now resembles a sustained re-rating of gold's place in the global financial system.\nA combination of persistent central-bank buying, shifting rate expectations and changing investor attitudes toward risk has helped keep gold's momentum intact. Perhaps most surprising, though, is how the metal has behaved alongside a relatively strong U.S. dollar, challenging long-held assumptions and leaving many investors wondering what comes next. Below, we'll break down what investors should know now.\nWanted to invest in gold now that the price is climbing? Get started here now.\nThe relationship between gold prices and the dollar\nBelow, experts break down why the price of gold keeps climbing and the precious metal's complex relationship with the dollar.\nWhy gold prices have been climbing\n\"Gold can be a valuable asset in a portfolio precisely because it has [a] low correlation with other asset classes,\" emphasizes Ben Nadelstein, head of content at Monetary Metals.\nThis independence from traditional market patterns has caught investors' attention, especially as the economy faces increasing uncertainty. The appeal of gold's unique behavior has helped drive its impressive price climb, but it's not the only factor at work. Industry professionals highlight other forces that have pushed gold prices higher:\nCentral bank buying: Central banks have dramatically increased their gold reserves in recent years and continue to do so.Investor sentiment: More investors are adding gold to diversify their portfolios amid inflationary and financial stability concerns.De-dollarization: The BRICS+ nations are reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar.Market evolution: Gold prices now respond to a broader range of global economic factors.\nHow gold prices typically move with the dollar\nHenry Yoshida, co-founder of Rocket Dollar, highlights that gold prices and the U.S. dollar traditionally move in opposite directions.\nAdvertisement\n\"A stronger U.S. dollar will suppress the price of gold, while a weaker U.S. dollar will likely drive the price of gold higher through increased demand,\" Yoshida says.\nBut Michael Petch, co-founder and president of Argo Digital Gold, points out that this relationship isn't absolute.\n\"[When there's] financial instability, gold and the dollar may [go up as people] seek safe-haven assets,\" Petch says.\nThe complex interplay between gold and the dollar\n\"Large-scale government accumulation has added a demand-side force that can push [gold] prices higher, even in a strong-dollar environment,\" Petch says.\nBeyond this influence, Kevin Bryan, director of customer experience at The Alloy Market, points to several often-overlooked factors that create a more nuanced dynamic:\nSupply limits: Mining strikes and environmental regulations can restrict gold production. As a result, gold prices may go up, even if the dollar is strong.Geopolitical risks: Rising global tensions and trade disputes create uncertainty. Naturally, this drives people to invest in safe-haven assets such as gold.Inflation concerns: Investors may turn to precious metals, including gold and silver, to hedge against inflation, regardless of current dollar strength.Digi"

                "body": "Gold Vs. Dollar: Why the Precious Metal Has Surpassed the U.S. Dollar as the World\u2019s Largest Reserve Asset\nFor decades, the U.S. dollar stood unchallenged as the cornerstone of the global financial system \u2014 the dominant reserve currency, the main medium for cross-border trade, and the bedrock of international monetary stability. But in a historic reordering of global assets, gold has now surpassed U.S. Treasury holdings to become the largest reserve asset held by central banks worldwide, signaling a dramatic shift in how nations protect and preserve wealth amidst inflation, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\ufffd\nGold Eagle +1\nA Historic Turn in Global Reserves\nOfficial data from the World Gold Council and recent financial reports reveal that central banks now hold more gold by value than U.S. government debt (Treasuries) for the first time since 1996. This is not just a numerical milestone \u2014 it marks a symbolic reassessment of risk and value at the highest levels of global finance. Gold holdings have climbed above $4 trillion while holdings of U.S. Treasuries stand slightly below that level, driven by robust gold price gains and deliberate reserve diversification.\ufffd\nGold Eagle\nTraditionally, foreign exchange reserves \u2014 the assets held by national monetary authorities to back liabilities and influence monetary policy \u2014 have been dominated by the dollar. Even as recently as 2024, the U.S. dollar accounted for around 46 % of total reserve assets, dwarfing gold\u2019s share at about 20 %. However, when gold is aggregated with currency reserves and Treasuries, recent estimates suggest its share has grown \u2014 pushing the dollar\u2019s effective proportion below the historic 50 % threshold.\ufffd\nCoinCodex\nWhat\u2019s Driving the Shift?\nSeveral key forces have propelled this shift:\n1. Inflation and Currency Risk:\nPersistent inflationary pressures in major economies have eroded confidence in fiat currencies, especially as central banks engage in unprecedented monetary easing. Gold, a tangible asset with intrinsic value, has long been seen as an inflation hedge \u2014 a reliable store of value when purchasing power falls. This perception has strengthened markedly among central bank reserve managers over the past few years.\ufffd\nFinancialContent\n2. Geopolitical Uncertainty:\nHeightened geopolitical tensions \u2014 from trade conflicts to sanctions and shifting alliances \u2014 have underscored vulnerabilities in dollar-based assets. Nations wary of exposure to U.S. economic policy or political leverage are increasingly diversifying their portfolios into assets like gold that are not tied to any single government\u2019s fiscal or monetary stance.\ufffd\nFinancialContent\n3. Central Bank Buying Frenzy:\nCentral banks have been accumulating gold in record volumes. For several consecutive years, official sector purchases have exceeded 1,000 metric tonnes annually \u2014 a level not seen since the height of the Bretton Woods era. Emerging economies such as India, China, and Turkey are among the most active buyers, reflecting both economic ambition and strategic caution.\ufffd\nForbes\nWhy This Matters\nThis historic shift has multiple implications:\nGlobal Financial Stability: A reserve system anchored by tangible assets like gold can act as a counterbalance to volatility in fiat currencies. Gold\u2019s neutrality \u2014 it isn\u2019t tied to any nation\u2019s political agenda \u2014 makes it particularly attractive in a fragmented global economy.\ufffd\nFXStreet\nInvestor Behavior: Retail and institutional investors are also taking note. As gold has surged to multi-year price highs \u2014 driven in part by central bank demand \u2014 it has reclaimed space not only as a hedge but as a strategic portfolio allocation. This trend has sparked renewed interest in gold ETFs, bullion, and commodities exposure across global markets.\ufffd\nInvestopedia\nU.S. Dollar\u2019s Role: While this shift doesn\u2019t signal the immediate end of dollar dominance \u2014 the currency still plays a central role in trade settlement and financial markets \u2014 it does highlight a gradual d"

                "body": "Global Industrial Demand and Hard Asset Preference Drive Market Surge\nSAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, January 20, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ \u2014 The global financial landscape has reached a definitive turning point as silver shatters historical records, surging over 220% from $28.92 per ounce in January 2025 to a current peak of $93.00. This rally is not merely a price spike; it represents a fundamental migration of capital away from \u201ccounterparty-dependent\u201d paper assets and toward the undeniable utility of hard, physical metal.\nAs the world enters 2026, the case for silver has evolved from a speculative hedge into a strategic necessity. The primary drivers are a lethal combination of a five-year structural supply deficit and the \u201chard-wiring\u201d of silver into the backbone of the next industrial revolution.\nThe Catalyst: AI Infrastructure and the \u201cGreen\u201d Machine\nSilver\u2019s unique status as the most conductive element on the periodic table has made it the non-negotiable substrate for the 2026 technology boom.\n\u2022 AI Data Centers: High-performance GPUs and the massive cooling systems required for generative AI models have driven an 8% year-over-year increase in electronics-grade silver demand.\n\u2022 Solar \u201cThrifting\u201d Fails: Despite attempts to reduce silver loading in solar cells, the sheer volume of global photovoltaic installations, projected to hit nearly 700 GW of capacity, has forced industrial demand to record highs of over 700 million ounces annually.\n\u2022 The 5G & EV Convergence: From 5G base stations to the silver-rich circuitry in electric vehicles (EVs), the world is literally \u201csilver-plating\u201d its future.\nThe Hard Asset Advantage: Physicality vs. Fiat\nInvestors are increasingly rejecting \u201cpaper silver\u201d (ETFs and unallocated accounts) in favor of physical delivery. This shift is rooted in three core realities:\n1. Zero Counterparty Risk: In an era of record sovereign debt, now exceeding $340 trillion globally, physical silver represents wealth that exists outside the ledger of any government or bank.\n2. A Depleting Vault: The Silver Institute reports that global inventories in COMEX and LBMA vaults have been drained to decade lows. With Mexico\u2019s 2024 mining restrictions further tightening the tap, the physical market is in a state of \u201cacute tightness\u201d that paper contracts can no longer suppress.\n3. The Gold-to-Silver Ratio (GSR): Even at $90+, silver remains undervalued relative to gold. Historically, in \u201chard money\u201d cycles, the GSR compresses toward 15:1. Should this occur in the current 2026 environment, silver\u2019s trajectory toward triple digits is not just possible, it is mathematically probable.\nMarket Outlook: The Path to $150\nInstitutional analysts have been forced to revise their \u201cpaper-based\u201d models to account for the physical shortage.\n\u2022 The Oregon Group: Recently released a briefing titled \u201cThe Path to $150,\u201d citing that mine supply (stagnant at ~820 million ounces) cannot keep pace with the combined force of industrial consumption and the flight to hard assets.\n\u2022 Citigroup: Has set a near-term target of $100 by Q1 2026, noting that the market is in a rare \u201cbackwardation\u201d phase, where immediate physical delivery is more valuable than future promises.\nThe Strategic Shift to Physical Sovereignty\nThe 2025\u20132026 silver rally is a wake-up call for the modern investor. As digital currencies and fiat systems face trust deficits, the world is returning to the certainty of hard assets. Silver stands at the intersection of this movement, half-monetary shield half-industrial engine, proving that in an age of artificial intelligence, there is no substitute for physical reality.\nDisclaimer: This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the market for precious metals and rare coins.

                "body": "International silver prices have surpassed $100 for the first time ever. On the 23rd (local time), silver futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, COMEX, closed at $101.33 per troy ounce (approximately 31.1g), surging 5.2% from the previous trading day. Silver prices, which jumped more than 150% over the course of 2025, have continued their upward trend this year.\nGold prices are also on a high-flying trend. On the 23rd, February-delivery gold futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to $4,979.70 per troy ounce, approaching the $5,000 mark. A pattern has emerged where gold leads the way, followed by silver with even larger gains.\n\u25c7Surging Demand for Safe-Haven Assets Amid Dollar Distrust\nThe driving force behind the surge in gold and silver prices is anxiety over dollar-denominated assets. Reuters reported that investors are seeking safe-haven assets to replace key currency assets like the U.S. dollar, as concerns mount over the U.S. federal government\u2019s high debt burden and shaken confidence in the independence of the Federal Reserve. The anxiety over the dollar has fueled the \"Sell America\" phenomenon, where investors reduce holdings of U.S. assets, and the \"debasement trade,\" where they shift to physical assets like gold and silver to hedge against currency devaluation. The Fed cut the benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points from September 2024 to December 2025, lowering it to the range of 3.50\u20133.75%. Independent metals trader Tai Wong told Reuters, \"In times of extreme economic and political uncertainty, gold and silver are becoming essential components of strategic portfolios as both a safe haven and a diversification tool.\"\nSilver, often called the \"companion of the gold rally\" due to its strong tendency to move in tandem with gold prices, has recently seen gains that surpass those of gold. While gold prices have risen by around 15% this year, silver has jumped approximately 44%. The gap in growth rates is linked to silver\u2019s \"dual nature.\" Silver not only benefits from safe-haven demand but also sees price boosts from industrial demand. Hwang Byung-jin, a researcher at NH Futures, said, \"Half of the world\u2019s silver is consumed for industrial uses such as electronics and solar power, leading it to be perceived as an industrial metal like copper. In phases where both gold and copper prices rise, silver\u2019s price performance has been particularly strong.\"\n\u25c7\"Risen Too Quickly\"\u2026Warnings of Silver Market Overheating\nAs silver prices surged rapidly in a short period, warnings have grown louder. Rona O\u2019Connell, an analyst at global commodities brokerage and research firm StoneX, described the silver market to Reuters as a \"self-propelled frenzy.\" This means that as prices rose, more funds flowed in, which in turn pushed prices higher. She warned, \"Once cracks begin to appear in silver prices, they could easily escalate into major fractures,\" adding, \"Buckle up.\" Michael Widmer, a strategist at Bank of America (BofA), stated, \"Around $60 per ounce is the appropriate level for silver prices.\" David Wilson, BNP Paribas\u2019 chief commodity strategist, noted, \"The investor-driven rally since late November has become overheated,\" and added, \"Profit-taking is not far off.\"\nHowever, some view that silver prices will not collapse abruptly given the persistent instability in financial markets. Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus, told Reuters, \"Silver will continue to gain strength from the same factors supporting gold investment demand,\" adding, \"Persistent tariff concerns and low physical liquidity in the London market are also supportive factors.\"\nThe increasing industrial use of silver, particularly in solar power, combined with insufficient supply and inventory, is another reason why silver prices are expected to remain volatile. Ok Ji-hee, a researcher at Samsung Futures, said, \"As solar-focused industrial consumption grows, the demand for silver has increased significantly.\" She added, \"If factors like in"

His administration is criminally investigating the chair of the Federal Reserve and is taking a scorched-earth approach on affordability by threatening key profit drivers for banks and institutional investors.\n2026 has gotten off to a chaotic start.\nYou\u2019d think that would be enough to send the stock market into a downward spiral. But equities traders are taking most of that news in stride: Stocks hit an all-time high Monday and have fallen back just a smidge since then.\nInstead, investors have expressed their fears by setting the metals market on fire.\nSilver rose more than 6% Wednesday, rising above $90 an ounce and is up 29% this year. That\u2019s a stunning gain, especially considering silver prices surged 141% in 2025 for their best performance since 1979.\nGold is up nearly 1% Wednesday, well above $4,600 a troy ounce, and it has gained 22% this year. Like silver, gold also posted its best year since 1979 in 2025, jumping 65%.\nTin, copper, aluminum, lithium and zinc prices are also on the rise in 2026.\nAdvertisement\nGold is a traditional safe haven against inflation, mounting deficits, geopolitical tensions and general economic concerns. Akin to a \u201cstuff it under the mattress\u201d mentality, investors snap up tangible assets, including gold, when they\u2019re worried.\nMetals prices leapt higher after the US strikes on Venezuela and again on Trump\u2019s threats against the Iranian regime after a widespread crackdown on protesters.\nDespite a muted response from stocks, metals got another boost after Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced Sunday he is the subject of a criminal investigation, sparking concerns that the Fed could lose its political independence. Although a more political Fed could benefit stocks in the short term by sending interest rates lower, it could hurt the economy in the long term by undermining the central bank\u2019s credibility and potentially reigniting an inflation problem.\nThose concerns have also somewhat rebooted the \u201cSell America\u201d trade, sending US Treasuries and the dollar lower. Concerns about large deficits have also given new rise to the \u201cdebasement trade\u201d that has exacerbated those trends. As money pours out of those markets, it makes assets like gold and silver look cheaper.\nMetals have more than fear going for them: Old-fashioned supply and demand is also helping. Despite rising tariffs, China has found new markets to export to, sending its trade surplus to a record high, driving demand for metals that go into Chinese-made electronics. AI\u2019s massive expansion has also fueled demand for metals in the data centers that power the growing technology.\nRising metals costs could pose a problem as Americans face growing cost-of-living problems. The components go into a wide range of consumer goods. And oil prices, though still low, have started to rise in tandem with other commodities.\n\u201cBottom line, we have some serious industrial metal inflation going on,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, an independent analyst, in a note to clients. \u201cThe next Fed Chair is going to have quite the dilemma on their hands.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

Brent crude rose by $1.82 to sell at $65.88; this is the highest price since January 14. U.S. crude oil traded at $61.07 with an increase of $1.71, marking the highest level in more than a week. Both oil benchmarks recorded a total weekly growth of over 2.5 percent.\nU.S. Sanctions Package Against Iran\u2019s Oil Sector\nOn Friday, the United States announced new sanctions against vessels carrying Iranian oil, causing concerns about oil supply disruptions in West Asia. The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Friday that the country has sanctioned 9 vessels and 8 companies related to the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products.\nThis comes as, according to OPEC statistics, Iran is the fourth-largest crude oil producer in OPEC after Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the UAE, with a production of about 3.2 million barrels per day.\nIran\u2019s Record-Breaking Oil Production Despite 520 Sanction Packages\nDespite the sanctions, Iran remains one of the main oil exporters to China and the top exporter of seaborne oil to the country. At the same time, the \u201cStatistical Review of World Energy\u201d report by the Energy Institute (UK) stated that the country\u2019s oil and condensate production reached 5.1 million barrels, breaking its 46-year post-revolution record.\nKazakhstan\u2019s Oil Production Problem\nMeanwhile, Kazakhstan is facing difficulties resuming production from one of the world\u2019s largest oil fields. Chevron announced that oil production at Kazakhstan\u2019s Tengiz oil field has not yet resumed; this follows the operator, Tengizchevroil, announcing the field\u2019s closure on Monday after a fire occurred.\nThis incident has intensified the problems of Kazakhstan\u2019s oil industry, which was already under pressure due to bottlenecks in its main export route in the Black Sea, damaged by Ukrainian drones."

The week opened with President Trump threatening military intervention in Iran amid unrest tied to economic collapse and reports of thousands of civilian deaths, warning the US would \u201ccome to their rescue\u201d if protesters were \u201cviolently\u201d killed.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers?

However, Denmark\u2019s PM Mette Frederiksen and Greenland\u2019s PM Jens Frederik Nielsen said sovereignty is not negotiable.\nA further shock was the threat of 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne after France signaled it may decline to join Trump\u2019s \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d an organization overlapping NATO and requiring a USD 1 billion payment for a permanent seat. Risk appetite repeatedly deteriorated after each new headline, and the dollar failed to benefit.\nDomestic US data were \u201cfine\u201d, but the Q3 GDP was revised to 4.4%, jobless claims rose to 200K, November PCE inflation ran at 2.8% with core at 2.8%, and January flash PMIs stayed expansionary. On the other hand, the White House intensified pressure on the Fed. The Department of Justice subpoenaed Chair Powell and threatened an indictment over HQ renovation testimony. With Powell\u2019s term ending in May and no successor named, markets hesitated to price in confident forward guidance.\nEUR/USD Next Week\u2019s Key Events:\n- FOMC meeting and press conference\n- US durable goods orders\n- US Producer Price Index\n- Germany Q4 GDP preliminary estimate\nNext week, the Fed meeting is the focal point. However, the real catalyst is whether guidance meaningfully shifts March-cut odds and whether Trump names Powell\u2019s replacement around the decision, reframing the entire path of policy and perceived Fed independence.\nThe Eurozone calendar is light, so Germany\u2019s Q4 GDP and flash January HICP are the key EUR inputs; absent major surprises, EURUSD is likely to remain a barometer of US headline risk, yield repricing, and risk sentiment.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about South African forex brokers?

                "body": "The Euro strengthened against the US Dollar, surging above 1.1800 due to speculation about intervention to support the Japanese Yen. The USD Dollar Index fell to 97.53, reaching levels not seen since September 2025. Economic data showed American consumer sentiment improving, with the University of Michigan\u2019s index rising to 56.4. US business activity indicated growth, albeit with potential deceleration in the first quarter of 2026.\nIn Europe, PMI data presented a mixed picture, with the Composite and Services PMI below expectations, while the Manufacturing PMI showed modest expansion. Upcoming economic updates will include Eurozone GDP figures and ECB official speeches, potentially impacting market directions. In the US, market watchers will focus on Durable Goods Orders and the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s policy decisions.\nTechnical Factors\nLooking at technical factors, the EUR/USD pair cleared resistance levels, indicating an upward trend with sights on 1.2000. The Euro remains the second most heavily traded currency worldwide and is sensitive to ECB interest rate changes and economic data. Strong economic indicators and a positive Trade Balance tend to boost the Euro\u2019s value, while weaker data can lead to declines.\nWith EUR/USD breaking decisively above 1.1800 on the back of intervention rumors, the immediate impact for us is a surge in market volatility. One-month implied volatility for the pair has jumped from around 6.5% to over 8% in the past day, making options strategies more expensive but also potentially more rewarding. This signifies that the market is bracing for larger price swings in the coming weeks.\nGiven the new upward trend, we should consider strategies that profit from a continued rise in the Euro. Buying call options with strike prices near the 2025 high of 1.1918 or the psychological 1.2000 level is a direct way to play this momentum. For those wary of the high premiums, a bull call spread could be a more cost-effective way to target a specific upside level while defining risk.\nHowever, we must remain cautious with the Federal Open Market Committee meeting just days away. While futures markets are pricing in a 92% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady, any hawkish language from Chairman Powell could cause a violent reversal in the dollar\u2019s recent weakness. Buying some out-of-the-money put options could serve as a cheap hedge to protect any bullish positions from a sudden snapback.\nJapan\u2019s Previous Interventions\nWe should also remember how Japan\u2019s unilateral interventions played out back in late 2022, where the initial impact was strong but often faded without sustained follow-through. A coordinated move involving the Fed is a different beast, but until confirmed, this rumor-driven rally is on shaky ground. Any sign that this was just a \u201crate check\u201d and not a prelude to action could see the dollar quickly regain its footing.\nFinally, the focus isn\u2019t solely on the dollar, as upcoming Eurozone GDP figures present a risk to the Euro\u2019s side of the equation. Economists\u2019 consensus predicts that growth for the fourth quarter of 2025 was a sluggish 0.1%, a figure that could cap the Euro\u2019s rally if confirmed. A weaker-than-expected GDP reading would make it difficult for the pair to sustain levels above 1.1800, regardless of dollar weakness."

                "body": "January 24: JD Vance\u2019s \u2018Titanic\u2019 Economy Remark Puts Policy Risk in Focus\nJD Vance Titanic is trending in U.S. politics and markets. The \u201csinking ship\u201d image works as a sharp Trump economy metaphor, centered on affordability and public spending. For German investors, the rhetoric raises policy risk around inflation, deficits, tariffs, and immigration enforcement. Those levers can shift risk premia, FX, and sector leadership into 2026. We outline why headlines matter in DE, where DAX exporters rely on U.S. demand and EUR strength, and how to position for affordability crisis politics and 2026 policy risk without chasing noise.\nWhat the metaphor signals for policy risk\nThe JD Vance Titanic framing highlights pressure on prices and living costs. It points to tighter fiscal choices, deficit debates, and possible tariff moves that can lift goods prices. The line is now in headlines, including analysis of the phrase\u2019s punch source. Markets may price higher term premia if deficits widen or tariffs reappear, with knock-on effects for EUR assets.\nImmigration policy is tied to wage growth, services costs, and productivity. Stricter enforcement can tighten U.S. labor supply, raise unit costs, and slow growth-sensitive sectors. It can also shift politics on border funding and enforcement scope. Related appearances keep the theme in view, including coverage of remarks in Ohio source. For pricing, tighter labor supply can support inflation persistence and higher-for-longer U.S. yields.\nWhy this matters for German investors\nGermany sells autos, machinery, and chemicals into the U.S. A stronger USD from policy risk can aid DAX exporters on translation, but U.S. tariffs or consumer strain can cut volumes. EUR/USD swings also hit hedging costs. We watch the JD Vance Titanic narrative because it keeps the Trump economy metaphor front and center for trade, FX, and earnings sensitivity.\nU.S. energy policy can sway LNG project approvals and flows. Tighter export rules may lift European gas premiums and German input costs, affecting margins for industry. Conversely, supportive supply keeps costs in check. That channel matters for CPI and ECB path expectations in the euro area, shaping discount rates for DE equities and credit spreads on corporate paper.\nHow markets could price 2026 policy risk\nIf affordability crisis politics push toward tariffs or bigger deficits, markets may price fatter term premia and wider credit spreads. That supports value over long-duration growth. A calmer path favors cyclicals and tight spreads. The JD Vance Titanic narrative is a signal to track hedging costs, EUR/USD correlation with Bund-Treasury spreads, and volatility around U.S. fiscal debates.\nPotential beneficiaries include defense, energy infrastructure, and select industrials with U.S. order backlogs. Laggards may include import-reliant retailers and long-duration tech facing higher discount rates. For Germany, autos and machinery with U.S. exposure need close watch on tariff talk. Chemical names feel feedstock and gas-price pass-through risk if LNG policy tightens.\nPortfolio moves for EUR-based investors\nWe frame three simple paths. One, restrictive policy with firm growth: higher-for-longer yields, stronger USD, support for value and energy. Two, tariff-heavy and deficit-driven: higher inflation risk premia and wider spreads. Three, moderation and deals: softer volatility and better conditions for quality cyclicals. JD Vance Titanic stays as an indicator for which path gains momentum.\nKeep FX hedges dynamic around EUR/USD on rate differentials. Mix inflation-linked Bunds with quality credit to balance carry and inflation risk. Tilt equity toward cash-generative exporters with pricing power and short supply chains. Use staged entries before 2026 policy risk milestones. Reassess LNG exposure in energy-heavy sectors, and keep tail hedges for tariff or funding showdowns.\nFinal Thoughts\nJD Vance Titanic has cut through because it centers on affordability and the cos"

Activity and demand data also surprised positively: UK retail sales rose 0.4% MoM in December (versus expectations for a fall), adding to signs of a pickup and supporting sterling sentiment, even if the FX follow-through was at times modest.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe UK flash PMI set added to the constructive tone by signalling continued expansion in private-sector activity, reinforcing the idea that the UK economy is not rolling over into the BoE\u2019s subsequent decisions.\nOn the US side, \u201cgood\u201d data didn\u2019t translate into a stronger dollar because geopolitics dominated. The US economy\u2019s momentum was confirmed as Q3 2025 GDP was revised up to a 4.4% annualized pace, and business surveys stayed expansionary with the S&P Global flash PMIs showing manufacturing at 51.9 and composite at 52.8 in January.\nAt the same time, tensions between the US and Europe over Greenland added to volatility in the risk premium. Trump said he would impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries under pressure from Greenland. Later, he also said that a \u201cframework\u201d had been talked about after meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Denmark and Greenland both stated that their sovereignty is not negotiable. That mix made the markets jumpy and hurt steady demand for the USD.\nIn the next week, there won\u2019t be any big UK releases, so the tape will lead. So, GBPUSD should mostly trade like a Fed-week USD cross, reacting to changes in US yield expectations and any new geopolitical or tariff news.\nIf the Fed is hawkish, the USD can be stronger than the improving data pulse of the GBP. Conversely, if the Fed stays balanced and yields fall, the GBP can hold up better than its peers, given last week\u2019s hotter CPI and stronger activity signals.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about South African forex brokers?

However, the RSI approaching the overbought region indicates a potential pullback to the 1.3565 area before an upside continuation.\nThe upside target for the pair lies at 1.3700, ahead of 1.3750. On the downside, if the price breaks and stays below the 1.3565 level could gather further selling pressure and drag towards 1.3500.\nLooking to trade forex now?

There is important resistance around 1.3570 seen in the first week of January.\nUoB commented; \u201cWhile the price action suggests the risk for GBP remains on the upside, it is unclear for now whether upward momentum is strong enough to break above the significant resistance at 1.3570.\u201d\nThe UK PMIbusiness confidence manufacturing index strengthened to a 17-month high of 51.6 for January from 50.6 the previous month and above consensus forecasts of no change.\nThe services-sector index posted a strong advance to a 21-month high of 54.3 from 51.4 and above expectations of 51.7. The overall composite output index also hit a 21-month high.\nBusiness confidence strengthened, but there was a further notable decline in employment.\nChris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence commented; \u201cUK businesses kicked up a gear in January, showing encouraging resilience in the face of recent geopolitical tensions.

The trigger is not sentiment but hard data. December UK Retail Sales rose 0.4% m/m against expectations for a -0.1% decline, while annual growth accelerated from 1.8% to 2.5% versus a 1% consensus. That is a clean positive demand surprise at year-end, not a statistical fluke.\nBusiness activity confirms the story. The flash Services PMI jumped from 51.4 to 54.3, the Composite PMI climbed from 51.4 to 53.9, and Manufacturing PMI improved from 50.6 to 51.6. All three sit above the 50 expansion line and all three moved higher together. That combination\u2014firmer consumption and broad-based PMI strength\u2014forces rate markets to reconsider the speed and depth of Bank of England easing and gives GBP a fundamental floor against USD.\nInflation And Bank Rate: Why 3.75% Keeps GBP Supported\nThe rate backdrop amplifies the data shock. Bank Rate stands at 3.75% after the December cut, with core CPI around 3.9%, nearly 1.9 percentage points above the 2% target. With growth and demand firming, the bar for rapid cuts is high. Every upside surprise in real activity with inflation still near 4% reduces the pressure on the BoE to ease and mechanically increases the relative appeal of GBP carry.\nThis is exactly what the latest move in GBP/USD reflects. Markets that only weeks ago were happy to talk about a neat BoE cutting path now have to price a central bank that can credibly stay restrictive for longer than the Fed. A 3.75% policy rate anchored by nearly 4% core inflation is not the backdrop for a currency collapse. It is the backdrop for a regime where dips toward 1.34\u20131.35 attract buyers rather than trigger a break toward 1.30.\nUS Macro Mix: Firm Sentiment, Softer Labour, And Heavy Cut Pricing\nThe US side of the pair looks less clean. The final January University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading printed 56.4, a five-month high and better than forecast. One-year inflation expectations sit near 4.0%, with five-year expectations around 3.3%. On the surface that combination argues for a central bank that can stay wary of cutting too early.\nYet rate expectations have moved the other way. The Fed funds target range is 3.50%\u20133.75%, roughly aligned with Bank Rate, but markets are still pricing more than 100 bps of cuts through 2026. Weekly jobless claims have nudged higher, pointing to a cooling labour market, and investors have chosen to focus on the prospect of easier policy rather than on modestly sticky inflation expectations. That mix\u2014solid sentiment, softening labour and an aggressive cut curve\u2014keeps the Dollar on the back foot against a currency backed by stronger incoming data and a more constrained central bank.\nPolicy Credibility Risk: Fed Independence And Dollar Reputation\nBeyond the macro prints, USD is dealing with a credibility discount. Repeated tariff threats, a confrontational trade agenda and public clashes around the Fed\u2019s independence create a perception problem. A Supreme Court case involving a sitting Fed governor after an attempted removal and reports of a criminal inquiry touching the Fed chair\u2019s testimony are not normal background noise for the world\u2019s reserve currency.\nFor FX markets, this is simple. A currency whose central bank is perceived as exposed to political interference trades at a lower premium than one where the policy committee still looks insulated. When that pressure arrives at the same time as an aggressive easing profile"

Takata was the sole dissenter, arguing that the price stability target had largely been achieved and that risks to prices were skewed to the upside, but with no support from other board members, the outcome was not read as hawkish. That contrasts with November, when both Takata and Tamura dissented ahead of December\u2019s hike, a reminder that while broader dissent does not guarantee action, it is when the risk of a move starts to feel more live.\nInflation, Growth Forecasts Upgraded\nIn its updated forecasts, the bank left its core inflation projections for fiscal years 2025 and 2027 unchanged at 2.7% and 2% respectively, the latter consistent with its inflation mandate. The 2026 forecast was nudged up by a tenth to 1.9%. More notable adjustments were made to the alternative core measure that excludes fresh food and energy, with forecasts for 2025 and 2026 lifted by two tenths to 3% and 2.2% respectively. The 2027 projection was left unchanged at 2%, easing pressure to tighten policy aggressively by Japanese standards. The upward revisions to the nearer-term inflation outlook partly reflected firmer growth expectations, with real GDP forecasts for 2025 and 2026 raised by 0.2% and 0.3% to 0.9% and 1% respectively.\nSource: BOJ\nAssessment Firms Post December Hike\nFollowing the decision to lift rates by 25bp to 0.75% in late December, there was a clear shift in tone in the latest Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. On underlying inflation, the language was firmer than before. Previously, inflation was described as sluggish and closely tied to the pace of growth. That wording has gone. Now, underlying inflation is seen rising moderately, with wages and prices reinforcing each other, suggesting the bank is increasingly comfortable that inflation momentum can be sustained, even as policy continues to normalise.\nThe labour market narrative has also firmed relative to three months ago. Before the December hike, labour shortages were framed as something that would emerge later if growth improved. In the latest assessment, labour tightness is more clearly embedded in the inflation story, reinforcing the idea that wage pressures are no longer hypothetical and are starting to look more durable. That's important. On risks, the earlier assessment that growth risks were skewed to the downside has been dropped, replaced by a broadly balanced view for both activity and prices.\nOn the external backdrop, the tone is noticeably calmer. Trade and overseas policy risks are still acknowledged, but they are no longer framed as dominant headwinds. Overseas growth is treated as stabilising, which helps explain why the bank appears comfortable letting policy normalisation proceed at a gradual pace.\nMarkets Unmoved, Ueda Awaits\nSource: Bloomberg\nThere was little reaction in the swaps market to the decision, outlook or updated forecasts, with another 25bp increase essentially deemed a lock by June with a second fully priced by December. That path would see the overnight rate lifted to 1.25%.\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY was also relatively steady, holding onto earlier modest gains, while the JGB 2s10s curve continued to bull-flatten, fitting with the move seen in the run-up to the meeting. Attention now turns to Governor Ueda\u2019s press conference, scheduled to begin at 3:30pm Tokyo time. Given his recent tendency to lean dovish in post-meeting remarks, there is potential for upside in USD/JPY should that pattern continue.\nUSD/JPY Risks Biased Higher\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY remains in a strong uptrend on the weekly chart, bouncing strongly from the int"

Despite Trump withdrawing his tariff threat, the US Dollar Index ended the week down 1.97% at 97.096. Crucially, the Index plunged to its lowest level since September 2025.\nA hawkish Bank of Japan Governor, Kazuo Ueda, lifted demand for the yen, accelerating USD/JPY\u2019s decline on Friday, January 23.\nIn a choppy week ending January 23, the USD/JPY pair climbed to a high of 159.225 before plunging to a low of 155.6. Despite a modest recovery, USD/JPY ended the week down 1.47% at 155.751.\nUS dollar weakness and a hawkish BoJ policy outlook support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, Japanese economic data will influence expectations of a BoJ rate hike. Key data includes consumer confidence, Tokyo inflation, the labor market, and retail sales.\nA continued upswing in consumer confidence and steady labor market conditions would likely fuel speculation about an April BoJ rate hike. Improving consumer confidence, alongside a stable labor market, would support a pickup in consumer spending. Upward trends in consumer spending would fuel demand-driven inflation and bolster the economy.\nMeanwhile, Tokyo inflation and Japanese retail sales trends will give insights into the national inflation and demand backdrop.\nGiven the BoJ\u2019s quarterly outlook report, strong Japanese economic indicators may also raise expectations of multiple rate hikes in 2026. A hawkish BoJ rate path would boost yen demand, supporting the bullish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nThe Bank of Japan projected stronger economic growth and higher inflation in 2026, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance.\nBeyond the data, election-related news and BoJ rhetoric will also influence buying interest in the yen and USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY rallied 6.12% in the final quarter of 2025 as markets reacted to Sanae Takaichi becoming the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. Her push for fiscal spending fueled concerns about national debt levels, given Japan\u2019s 240% debt-to-GDP ratio. Notably, debt jitters sent the risk premium for Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) soaring to their highest level in decades, pressuring the yen.\n10-year JGB yields and USD/JPY climbed higher in January 2026, impacted by Prime Minister Takaichi calling a snap election. A landslide victory would strengthen the LDP\u2019s control, enabling Prime Minister Takaichi to pursue her policy goals uncontested.\nWhile the yen has weakened over concerns about Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending and national debt levels, a hawkish BoJ policy outlook is likely to be key for USD/JPY trends.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nAs markets consider Japanese politics and the BoJ\u2019s policy stance, US economic data and the Fed will influence buying interest in the US dollar. Key US economic indicators and events include:\nStronger consumer confidence and a modest rise in jobless claims would signal a pickup in private consumption. Increased spending would boost economic momentum and fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish Fed rate path. Fading bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut would lift demand for the US Dollar, sending USD/JPY higher.\nProducer prices will also be key, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Higher producer prices would indicate an uptick in consumer prices, tempering expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. For context, producers adjust prices higher or lower, depending on demand, passing higher prices or cost savings on to consumers.\nThe US data will influence the appetite for the US dollar.

                "body": "USD/JPY Today, January 25: NY Fed Rate Checks Spark Yen Surge\nUSD/JPY jumped after reports that the New York Fed conducted rate checks, lifting yen intervention risk and sparking talk of Japan-US coordinated intervention. The pair briefly traded around 155.66 in New York, putting FX at the center of today\u2019s Japan market focus. We explain what this means for equities, hedging, and near-term scenarios. With the BOJ holding policy steady, traders are watching official signals and liquidity conditions that could sway USD/JPY moves in the coming sessions.\nWhat sparked the yen surge\nTraders cited reports that the New York Fed conducted USD/JPY rate checks on behalf of the U.S. Treasury. That action often precedes or tests the market before potential intervention, so it drew fast attention. In New York trading, USD/JPY touched about 155.66, the strongest yen in four weeks, according to Reuters source.\nThe move followed the BOJ\u2019s policy hold, which had kept FX fragile. The rate check headlines flipped positioning and boosted the yen. Local media also highlighted the chance of joint action if dollar weakness extends, keeping volatility elevated source. Equity futures and Japan-sensitive risk assets turned choppy as traders assessed whether authorities would escalate beyond monitoring and verbal warnings.\nWhat it means for Japan investors\nA stronger yen can weigh on exporters that book overseas revenue, while importers may benefit from lower input costs in JPY terms. Automakers, machinery, and tech hardware often face near-term earnings pressure when USD/JPY falls. Airlines, retailers dependent on imports, and utilities can see relief on fuel and commodity costs. Financials may face mixed effects as FX volatility raises trading and hedging activity but can slow cross-border deal flow.\nWe expect firms to revisit hedge ratios. A quick USD/JPY drop can raise the price of dollar hedges and widen bid-ask spreads. Treasurers may consider laddered forwards and options to avoid timing risk. For households and SMEs with USD needs, staggered conversions and alert levels help reduce slippage. Keep settlement calendars handy since thin liquidity around fixes can amplify intraday swings.\nIntervention scenarios on the table\nMarkets are weighing Japan-US coordinated intervention if volatility worsens. A rate check increases the odds that authorities are mapping liquidity and price depth. Clear messages from Japan\u2019s MOF and the U.S. Treasury would be key tells. If USD/JPY momentum turns disorderly, joint action becomes more likely. Absent strong guidance, officials may prefer jawboning and targeted checks to steady trading.\nWe see two broad paths. If policy signals stay firm and yields slip, USD/JPY could grind lower as shorts add. If U.S. data or yields rebound, the pair can stabilize or retrace. Watch round numbers near 155 and 156 for liquidity pockets. Spreads may widen during the Tokyo fix and New York handover, creating slippage and quick reversals.\nPractical strategies for the week\nKeep position sizes small and use hard stops given headline risk. Options can help define downside while keeping upside open if intervention chatter fades. Consider conditional orders around event windows to reduce screen risk. If you hedge inventory or receivables, split orders across sessions to average execution. Track USD/JPY correlation with Nikkei futures to manage cross-asset exposure.\nList priority signals: MOF comments, any confirmed rate checks, and changes in U.S. yield curves. Review FX VaR against new volatility and adjust hedges to policy dates or data releases. For equity exposure, test earnings sensitivity to a stronger yen in guidance ranges. Keep cash buffers for margin calls, and avoid adding leverage during thin liquidity hours.\nFinal Thoughts\nUSD/JPY\u2019s jump on reported NY Fed rate checks shifted focus to intervention risk and policy signals. For Japan investors, the key is to separate noise from actionable tells. Monitor official comments, liquidi"

The index has held below this key pivot zone for the past four-weeks with weekly RSI highlighting divergence since October. The focus remains on possible inflection off this zone with a breach / weekly close above needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nS&P 500 Price Chart \u2013 SPX500 Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; S&P 500 on TradingView\nA closer look at the S&P 500 daily chart shows the index trading within the confines of a proposed near-term descending pitchfork. A decline of more than 3% off the record highs rebounded off the median-line this week with an outside-day reversal on Wednesday closing the week just below the upper parallel. Initial support rests with the 1.618% extension of the monthly decline at 6798 backed closely by the December low-day close (LDC) at 6770. Broader bullish invalidation rests at 6697-6718- a region defined by the 61.8% retracement of the November advance and the objective December low. Note that basic channel support converges on this zone into the close of the month and a break / close below would suggest a more significant high is place and a larger trend reversal is underway.\nA topside breach / daily close above 6983 would be needed to mark uptrend resumption with the next technical consideration eyed at the 1.382% extension of the broader 2020 advance near 7138.\nBottom line: The S&P 500 is trading into pivotal resistance with the monthly range set just below. While the broader outlook remains constructive, the risk remains for near-term inflection off this mark with the bulls vulnerable while below. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 6696 on pullbacks IF the index is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 6983 ultimately needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nNasdaq Price Chart \u2013 NDX Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; NDX on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: The Nasdaq is trading within a well-defined monthly opening-range just below resistance at the 2025 high-week close (HWC) at 25858. The index has been trading within an ascending pitchfork extending off the 2025 low with a failed attempt to breakout in October highlighting the risk for a pullback towards the 75% parallel. Initial support converges on this slope over the next few weeks at the 61.8% retracement of the November rally near 24625. Losses below this threshold would threaten a deeper pullback within the broader uptrend with subsequent support seen at the August HWC and the 23.6% retracement of the 2025 rally at 23712/907. Broader bullish invalidation rests with the 52-week moving average which converges on the median-line near 22815.\nResistance remains unchanged at 25858 and is backed by the 2025 swing high at 26182 and the 1.618% extension of the broader 2020 advance at 26609.

                "body": "USD/JPY sees a second decline in eight weeks as confidence in the US dollar dives.\nPresident Trump\u2019s tariff threat and push to acquire Greenland undermined US dollar demand, sending the US Dollar Index sharply lower. Despite Trump withdrawing his tariff threat, the US Dollar Index ended the week down 1.97% at 97.096. Crucially, the Index plunged to its lowest level since September 2025.\nA hawkish Bank of Japan Governor, Kazuo Ueda, lifted demand for the yen, accelerating USD/JPY\u2019s decline on Friday, January 23.\nIn a choppy week ending January 23, the USD/JPY pair climbed to a high of 159.225 before plunging to a low of 155.6. Despite a modest recovery, USD/JPY ended the week down 1.47% at 155.751.\nUS dollar weakness and a hawkish BoJ policy outlook support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, Japanese economic data will influence expectations of a BoJ rate hike. Key data includes consumer confidence, Tokyo inflation, the labor market, and retail sales.\nA continued upswing in consumer confidence and steady labor market conditions would likely fuel speculation about an April BoJ rate hike. Improving consumer confidence, alongside a stable labor market, would support a pickup in consumer spending. Upward trends in consumer spending would fuel demand-driven inflation and bolster the economy.\nMeanwhile, Tokyo inflation and Japanese retail sales trends will give insights into the national inflation and demand backdrop.\nGiven the BoJ\u2019s quarterly outlook report, strong Japanese economic indicators may also raise expectations of multiple rate hikes in 2026. A hawkish BoJ rate path would boost yen demand, supporting the bullish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nThe Bank of Japan projected stronger economic growth and higher inflation in 2026, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance.\nBeyond the data, election-related news and BoJ rhetoric will also influence buying interest in the yen and USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY rallied 6.12% in the final quarter of 2025 as markets reacted to Sanae Takaichi becoming the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. Her push for fiscal spending fueled concerns about national debt levels, given Japan\u2019s 240% debt-to-GDP ratio. Notably, debt jitters sent the risk premium for Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) soaring to their highest level in decades, pressuring the yen.\n10-year JGB yields and USD/JPY climbed higher in January 2026, impacted by Prime Minister Takaichi calling a snap election. A landslide victory would strengthen the LDP\u2019s control, enabling Prime Minister Takaichi to pursue her policy goals uncontested.\nWhile the yen has weakened over concerns about Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending and national debt levels, a hawkish BoJ policy outlook is likely to be key for USD/JPY trends.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nAs markets consider Japanese politics and the BoJ\u2019s policy stance, US economic data and the Fed will influence buying interest in the US dollar. Key US economic indicators and events include:\nStronger consumer confidence and a modest rise in jobless claims would signal a pickup in private consumption. Increased spending would boost economic momentum and fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish Fed rate path. Fading bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut would lift demand for the US Dollar, sending USD/JPY higher.\nProducer prices will also be key, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Higher producer prices would indicate an uptick in consumer prices, tempering expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. For context, producers adjust prices higher or lower, depending on demand, passing higher prices or cost savings on to consumers.\nThe US data will influence the appetite for the US dollar. However, the Fed\u2019s rate statement and pre"

Initial bias stays on the downside this week for 1.3641 support first. Firm break there will target 1.3538 low. On the upside, above 1.3781 minor resistance will turn intraday bias neutral.\nIn the bigger picture, price actions from 1.4791 are seen as a corrective pattern to the whole up trend from 1.2005 (2021 low).

For now, medium term outlook will be neutral until there are signs that the correction has completed.\nIn the long term picture, rising 55 M EMA (now at 1.3576) remains intact. Thus, up trend from 0.9056 (2007 low) should still be in progress. However, considering bearish divergence condition M MACD, sustained trading below 55 M EMA will argue that the up trend has completed with five waves up to 1.4791, and turn medium term outlook bearish for correction to 38.2% retracement of 0.9056 to 1.4791 at 1.2600."

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Blasts Through 1.36 as Strong UK Data Collide With a Weakening Dollar\nSterling rallies from 1.34 to 1.36 on Retail Sales and PMI surprises, stubborn 3.9% core CPI and a cautious BoE, while Trump-driven trade risk and over 100 bps of expected Fed cuts drag the Greenback lower | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD: Sterling Breaks 1.36 As Macro Divergence Deepens\nUK Data Shock: Retail Sales And PMIs Reprice The Pound\nGBP/USD has ripped from the mid-1.34 band to trade between 1.3540\u20131.3600, marking a four-month high and validating a clear macro shift in favour of Sterling. The trigger is not sentiment but hard data. December UK Retail Sales rose 0.4% m/m against expectations for a -0.1% decline, while annual growth accelerated from 1.8% to 2.5% versus a 1% consensus. That is a clean positive demand surprise at year-end, not a statistical fluke.\nBusiness activity confirms the story. The flash Services PMI jumped from 51.4 to 54.3, the Composite PMI climbed from 51.4 to 53.9, and Manufacturing PMI improved from 50.6 to 51.6. All three sit above the 50 expansion line and all three moved higher together. That combination\u2014firmer consumption and broad-based PMI strength\u2014forces rate markets to reconsider the speed and depth of Bank of England easing and gives GBP a fundamental floor against USD.\nInflation And Bank Rate: Why 3.75% Keeps GBP Supported\nThe rate backdrop amplifies the data shock. Bank Rate stands at 3.75% after the December cut, with core CPI around 3.9%, nearly 1.9 percentage points above the 2% target. With growth and demand firming, the bar for rapid cuts is high. Every upside surprise in real activity with inflation still near 4% reduces the pressure on the BoE to ease and mechanically increases the relative appeal of GBP carry.\nThis is exactly what the latest move in GBP/USD reflects. Markets that only weeks ago were happy to talk about a neat BoE cutting path now have to price a central bank that can credibly stay restrictive for longer than the Fed. A 3.75% policy rate anchored by nearly 4% core inflation is not the backdrop for a currency collapse. It is the backdrop for a regime where dips toward 1.34\u20131.35 attract buyers rather than trigger a break toward 1.30.\nUS Macro Mix: Firm Sentiment, Softer Labour, And Heavy Cut Pricing\nThe US side of the pair looks less clean. The final January University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading printed 56.4, a five-month high and better than forecast. One-year inflation expectations sit near 4.0%, with five-year expectations around 3.3%. On the surface that combination argues for a central bank that can stay wary of cutting too early.\nYet rate expectations have moved the other way. The Fed funds target range is 3.50%\u20133.75%, roughly aligned with Bank Rate, but markets are still pricing more than 100 bps of cuts through 2026. Weekly jobless claims have nudged higher, pointing to a cooling labour market, and investors have chosen to focus on the prospect of easier policy rather than on modestly sticky inflation expectations. That mix\u2014solid sentiment, softening labour and an aggressive cut curve\u2014keeps the Dollar on the back foot against a currency backed by stronger incoming data and a more constrained central bank.\nPolicy Credibility Risk: Fed Independence And Dollar Reputation\nBeyond the macro prints, USD is dealing with a credibility discount. Repeated tariff threats, a confrontational trade agenda and public clashes around the Fed\u2019s independence create a perception problem. A Supreme Court case involving a sitting Fed governor after an attempted removal and reports of a criminal inquiry touching the Fed chair\u2019s testimony are not normal background noise for the world\u2019s reserve currency.\nFor FX markets, this is simple. A currency whose central bank is perceived as exposed to political interference trades at a lower premium than one where the policy committee still looks insulated. When that pressure arrives at the same time as an aggressive easing profile"

Earn users received up to 8% annual returns on cryptocurrency deposits.\nIn mid-November 2022, the exchange suspended payments under the program.

Since they invest in the same thing, you almost need to split hairs to find a differentiator.\nWith Bitcoin ETFs, it all comes down to cost.\nIt's been a tumultuous year for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which ultimately produced a lot of volatility but nothing in the way of returns. After such a strong multiyear rally, a year \"off\" to digest gains and stabilize a bit is probably a good thing. But as we move forward into 2026, it's time to revisit the investment case again.\nBitcoin has, in my opinion, gone from alternative asset class to necessary portfolio allocation. In the same way we talk about stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate in a diversified portfolio, we should be adding Bitcoin to the discussion. Based on how the crypto market has evolved and the tailwinds of decentralization and AI development behind it, now's the time to look at building up Bitcoin positions again.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWith nearly a dozen different Bitcoin ETFs to choose from all essentially doing the same thing, the differentiator is cost. All invest in spot Bitcoin, so it makes sense to choose the one that lets you do it the cheapest.\nThe most popular Bitcoin ETF by a wide margin is the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) with more than $70 billion in assets under management.

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH 0.65%) is pretty much never the cheapest, nor the fastest, nor the smoothest blockchain to use. Still, some long-term investors prefer owning it to other cryptocurrencies, because they're buying an asset with exposure to a critically important platform within the crypto ecosystem more than they are depending on any single feature of that platform to deliver a return.\nSo if you care about what can still be relevant in crypto in five or 10 years, Ethereum's mix of steady economic activity on-chain, ongoing tech upgrades, and high degree of traditional finance access are hard to ignore as a package. Let's dive in and look at these factors a bit more.\nThis chain is the default for quite a few activities\nEthereum is far and away the most established general-purpose smart contract chain, and that status is the most important reason why it's valuable. Decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, meaning on-chain lending, trading, and collateral management, concentrate where the most liquidity and integrations already exist, which, in the crypto sector, effectively means that every dollar that flows in has good odds of settling on Ethereum either temporarily or permanently.\nOne metric to watch on this front is DeFi total value locked (TVL), which corresponds to the dollar value of assets deposited into DeFi apps. Ethereum leads all other chains on TVL today, with $69.4 billion in TVL, and there is no reason to expect that to change anytime soon, as for a long time the chain's name was effectively synonymous with DeFi.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nEthereum is also constantly being upgraded to offer better features and higher efficiency to users and app developers. Recently, the chain has experienced a pace of two major updates per year, which is considerably more than most of its peers.\nIt's a store of value, too\nEthereum's supply is not capped like Bitcoin (BTC 1.00%), but it's not trying to be Bitcoin with extra features either. Under its proof-of-stake (PoS) design, the network's validators lock up their coins to secure the network and earn a reward; that reward is provided by issuing new Ether and adding to the supply. And, during transactions, which incur gas fees, a portion of the fees are burned, removing them from circulation permanently.\nImportantly, Ethereum's ongoing fee burn can and often does exceed its ongoing issuance, so its circulating supply can shrink during busier periods. That makes the coin a store of value, even if its supply isn't anywhere near as scarce as Bitcoin's is -- and being a store of value with as much utility as Ethereum is another big reason why many long-term investors prefer to hold it.\nCRYPTO: BTC\nKey Data Points\nFinally, the coin now has a handful of different institutional on-ramps, which helps to attract and retain institutional capital. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are nothing new at this point, but they do help to increase the asset's legitimacy and make it more appealing to those who have a more conservative temperament when investing.\nThere's no other crypto asset that's precisely as appealing as Ethereum. That doesn't mean you should buy it if you aren't quite tolerant of risk, but if you want to hold any crypto beyond Bitcoin, you should probably hold at least some Ethereum."

                "body": "Ethereum gas fees have dropped considerably, despite on-chain data showing network activity has increased. Meanwhile, a looming breakout from a triangle pattern suggests a rally to $4,000 may be imminent, despite ongoing market volatility. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,952, up 0.59% over the past 24 hours, amid surging long liquidations across the broader crypto market.\nEthereum Gas Fees Remain Low as Network Activity Peaks\nOn-chain data suggests the Ethereum network may have solved the issue of high gas fees that have plagued it for years. According to Etherscan, gas fees have dropped to an average of $0.0027, the lowest level in years.\nThis drop comes despite network activity increasing, a factor that has always been linked to high fees on the blockchain. Data from YCharts shows that Ethereum daily transactions have soared to 2.39 million, the highest level in more than five years. Additionally, the daily active addresses have doubled in the last two weeks to more than 800,000.\nThere has also been an influx of new users joining the network. Recently, ZyCrypto reported that Ethereum\u2019s wallet growth has reached a record high, indicating an influx of new users joining the network.\nThe resilience of Ethereum, with gas fees remaining low even as more users are on the network, can be attributed to network upgrades. The Fusaka upgrade that went live last month is one of the factors attributed to the drop.\nThis month, Ethereum has also adjusted the blob parameters, reducing data costs for layer two rollups. Because of these two improvements, it has become cheaper for users to use Ethereum even when many users are on the network.\nBullish Triangle Pattern Signals Potential Rally to $4,000\nAs the Ethereum network shows resilience, analyst Ali Charts has shared a bullish outlook for X, predicting the price could surge to $4,000. The analyst attributed his forecast to a bullish ascending triangle pattern, whose breakout could lead to such gains.\nThe key resistance level Ethereum needs to break to reach $4,000 is $3,413. If the price can move above this level and push past $3,660, the analyst notes that this breakout rally may be possible.\nHowever, the bullish thesis depends on whether ETH can hold the $3,085 support level for the bullish leg to occur."

About a year ago, the firm initiated a strategic reset, asking a simple but fundamental question: what is the best way for customers to move assets fully onchain?\nTodd McDonald, R3\u2019s co-founder, said that process coincided with a deep review of the blockchain landscape.\n\u201cWe spoke to essentially all the layer ones and layer twos,\u201d he explained in an interview with CoinDesk, as R3 evaluated where institutional capital markets were most likely to migrate. That work culminated in a strategic partnership with the Solana Foundation, announced last May at the blockchain's Accelerate conference, he said.\nA layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of offchain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.\nThe decision, McDonald said, was grounded in a long-term conviction that all markets will ultimately become onchain markets.\n\u201cWe think Solana is the best network for that future,\u201d he said, pointing to its structure, throughput and trading-first design. R3 came to see Solana as \u201cthe Nasdaq of blockchains,\u201d a venue purpose-built for high-performance capital markets rather than general experimentation.\nThrough its Corda blockchain platform, R3 supports more than $10 billion in assets and works with participants including HSBC, Bank of America, the Bank of Italy, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Swiss National Bank, Euroclear, SDX and SBI, he said.\nTokenization, the process of representing real-world assets such as stocks and bonds as digital tokens tradable on blockchain networks, has emerged as one of the key use cases drawing growing interest and investment from traditional financial institutions.\nActivity in decentralized finance (DeFi) remains concentrated on a handful of chains, with Ethereum still the largest by total value locked (TVL), reflecting its deep liquidity, broad developer ecosystem and institutional adoption. However, Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms, benefitting from high throughput, ultra-low fees and rapidly expanding user engagement.\nRecent data shows Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem holding more than $9 billion in TVL, making it one of the top networks outside Ethereum and its Layer 2s, and in some periods rivaling the combined DeFi activity of major Ethereum L2s.\nSolana\u2019s model has driven significantly higher onchain transaction volume and active wallets, especially for trading and high-frequency applications, even as Ethereum retains overall TVL dominance and the largest share of institutional assets.\nSince that pivot last May, R3 has spent the past eight to nine months almost entirely focused on one problem: how to tokenize the next trillion dollars of assets and bring them onchain in a way that actually works for investors. That means not just issuing tokens, but designing products that existing onchain allocators want to use, and that traditional investors can grow into over time.\nMcDonald said R3 is already seeing a shift in focus on Solana toward capital formation and capital allocation, rather than pure speculation.\nLiquidity, McDonald argued, is the real bottleneck for tokenized real-world assets.\n\u201cThe beating heart of DeFi is borrow and lend,\u201d he said."

Ethereum: Network Activity Hints at Recovery as Early 2026 Remains Choppy\nEthereum has entered early 2026 with renewed attention, as on-chain activity and developer engagement continue to highlight the network\u2019s resilience. Ongoing use across decentralized finance and staking ecosystems suggests steady participation rather than panic-driven exits, even as broader market volatility keeps traders cautious. Analysts remain divided in the short term, but long-term optimism around Ethereum\u2019s role in tokenization, infrastructure, and smart contracts continues to anchor sentiment.\nDespite recent price swings, Ethereum is still widely viewed as a core holding for investors focused on established blockchain platforms. Its dominance across DeFi and institutional experimentation keeps it firmly in the conversation about the most important cryptos to watch this cycle.\n3. Solana: Ecosystem Developments Sustain Momentum Through Market Uncertainty\nSolana remains a major talking point in early 2026, supported by continued ecosystem expansion and growing interest in its speed-focused infrastructure. Even amid broader market pullbacks, network upgrades, product launches, and user incentives have helped maintain engagement across its ecosystem. Community sentiment remains constructive, though recent project-level controversies serve as a reminder of the risks that come with rapid growth.\nSolana\u2019s reputation for fast execution and low transaction costs keeps it popular among traders and developers alike, particularly during volatile periods. Its ability to recover from past downturns continues to reinforce confidence in its long-term relevance.\n4. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Interest Shape 2026 Outlook\nXRP has re-entered focus as regulatory uncertainty fades and institutional narratives gain traction. With legal challenges largely behind it, Ripple is positioning itself around broader adoption themes tied to payments, stablecoins, and on-chain finance. Market sentiment remains optimistic, though near-term volatility is expected as supply events and macro conditions intersect.\nDespite recent fluctuations, XRP\u2019s long-standing use case in cross-border transactions keeps it relevant in conversations about enterprise-focused crypto assets. Investors are watching closely to see whether renewed confidence can translate into sustained momentum.\n5. Chainlink: Expanding Real-World Data Access Strengthens Long-Term Narrative\nChainlink continues to reinforce its role as critical blockchain infrastructure, with new integrations aimed at bridging traditional markets and decentralized applications. By expanding access to real-world data on-chain, Chainlink is deepening its relevance across DeFi, trading platforms, and institutional use cases. Accumulation trends and ecosystem development suggest confidence in its long-term positioning.\nAlthough short-term price movements remain uncertain, Chainlink\u2019s oracle technology is widely viewed as foundational to the broader crypto ecosystem. Its steady evolution keeps it firmly on the radar of long-term participants.\n6. Hyperliquid: Strong Trading Activity Meets Heightened Risk Awareness\nHyperliquid has gained significant attention for its role in decentralized derivatives trading, emerging as a key venue for high-volume activity. At the same time, recent controversies tied to ecosystem partners have introduced caution, highlighting the risks associated with fast-moving DeFi environments. Market sentiment remains mixed, balancing innovation with governance concerns.\nDespite the turbulence, Hyperliquid\u2019s ability to attract traders underscores the demand for on-chain perpetual markets. How it navigates trust and transparency challenges will likely define its next chapter.\n7. Sui: Technical Setbacks Offset by Long-Term Innovation Vision\nSui has experienced renewed scrutiny in early 2026 following technical disruptions, but recovery efforts and ongoing development have helped stabilize sentiment.

MarketWatch calculated that Goldman Sachs and Caterpillar alone shaved more than 300 points off the Dow that day.\nIntel\u2019s forecast hit investors squarely. The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue of $12.2 billion and adjusted earnings around breakeven. Analysts had been looking for roughly $12.57 billion in revenue and a small profit, according to Investors Business Daily. (Investors)\nMacro data offered little clarity on the growth versus inflation debate. S&P Global\u2019s flash composite PMI, which surveys business activity, stayed steady at 52.8 in January. Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson pointed to rising costs, \u201cwidely blamed on tariffs,\u201d as a factor keeping affordability in the spotlight. (S&P Global)\nConsumer mood nudged up, but the bounce was modest. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index edged to a final 56.4 in January. Survey director Joanne Hsu noted that households continue to face \u201cpressures on their purchasing power\u201d due to elevated prices. (Reuters)\nMoney continued flowing into safe havens. Gold futures climbed around 1.4%, reaching near $4,980 an ounce late Friday. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped under 4.24%, according to Investopedia. (Investopedia)\nTraders are largely betting the Fed will hold steady. The odds sit near 97% that the central bank will keep its key rate between 3.5% and 3.75%. Still, investors expect Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference to focus heavily on concerns about the Fed\u2019s independence. (Investopedia)\nThe week ahead is tight, with little room for slip-ups. Barron\u2019s points out that Powell\u2019s term as chair wraps up in May, meaning his comments might \u201ccarry more weight than ever.\u201d That could rattle stocks if he turns out more hawkish than investors anticipate. (Barron\u2019s)\nThe next major event hits Wednesday: the Fed\u2019s policy decision comes out at 2 p.m. ET on Jan. 28, with Powell\u2019s press conference kicking off at 2:30 p.m., according to the central bank\u2019s schedule. Afterward, investors will shift focus back to earnings and guidance, hunting for signs that AI spending is translating into profits rather than just ballooning costs. (Federalreserve)"

                "body": "AV.L Stock Today: January 24 \u2013 Near-6% Yield Keeps Insurer in Focus\nThe aviva share price hovered near 660p this week as income buyers weighed a near-6% Aviva dividend yield and a clear date for Aviva earnings March 5. As a FTSE 100 insurer, Aviva remains under watch for cash generation and capital strength that keep payouts sustainable. We see rising retail interest in the AV.L ticker, with attention on solvency, underwriting results, and any fresh guidance on the final dividend. Shares have been steady despite mixed UK macro headlines, which keeps valuation anchored to cash flow and distribution policy.\nAviva at 660p: what income investors are watching\nCommentary highlights a near-6% Aviva dividend yield, underpinned by strong cash generation and a solid profit pipeline. For insurers, recurring cash from life, pensions, and general insurance supports dividends through the cycle. We will watch operating capital generation and the board\u2019s payout guidance to judge sustainability. If cash trends stay firm, the aviva share price can benefit from steady income demand and lower perceived risk.\nFull-year results on 5 March are the next catalyst. Management typically sets the final dividend with the annual report, so guidance and outlook commentary matter for 2025 income planning. We expect focus on policy consistency, timing, and any signals on future growth. Clear direction on payouts could stabilise the aviva share price into spring, as retail holders target predictable cash returns.\nWhat could move the shares into results\nInvestors will look for solvency coverage, operating capital generation, and the general insurance combined ratio. New business value in life, retention rates, and expense progress will also shape sentiment. These datapoints show how profits convert to cash. Strong conversion, with disciplined underwriting, tends to support the aviva share price by reinforcing confidence in the dividend and the FTSE 100 insurer\u2019s balance sheet.\nWith UK rates higher than recent years, reinvestment yields on the asset book can lift long-term returns, offsetting some claims inflation. Market moves in gilts and credit spreads will influence this. If pricing discipline holds in general insurance, margin resilience follows. Together, these factors can keep income appeal intact and help the aviva share price defend current levels around 660p.\nClear capital allocation, covering organic growth, technology spend, and distributions, adds confidence. Investors value consistency between strategy, cash flow, and dividends. Any commentary on cost saves, product mix, or simplification can reduce uncertainty. When uncertainty falls, required returns ease, which can support the aviva share price. We think a steady policy path would matter as much as headline profit numbers.\nValuation context against FTSE peers\nA near-6% headline yield stands out versus the broader index, which attracts UK savers seeking reliable cash. That income premium often offers a buffer in choppy markets. If the payout looks secure, the aviva share price can trade on stability rather than momentum. We will compare post-results guidance with peers to judge if the FTSE 100 insurer still offers a relative edge.\nShares have hovered around 660p this week, with coverage citing income appeal and solid cash trends. Recent articles discuss the path ahead for payouts and capital strength, including analysis on Prediction: in 12 months the rampant Aviva share price and dividend could turn \u00a310,000 into\u2026 and \u00a35,000 in Aviva shares could unlock this much passive income\u2026. This focus helps the aviva share price stay in the conversation ahead of Aviva earnings March 5.\nSimple watchlist plan for UK investors\nWe prefer staged entries, using monthly drips to manage price swings. Before buying, we would review insurance risk exposure, reserve strength, and reinsurance protection. We also note sensitivities to weather events, credit markets, and claims inflation.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full focus as German blue chips show a powerful, energetic upswing after a period of nervous, sideways action. We are seeing a confident bullish push, with the index trading near elevated zones that make both breakout traders and cautious bears sit up. Volatility is alive, intraday swings are meaningful, and each dip gets tested quickly by aggressive buyers, but the upside still feels fragile because macro clouds have not gone away. This is classic late?cycle tension: strong moves, but fragile confidence.\nThe Story: To understand what the DAX is really pricing in right now, you need to zoom out to the full European macro setup:\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 From Pain To Potential Relief\nThe European Central Bank remains the main puppet?master. After an intense hiking cycle to crush inflation, the ECB has shifted towards a more cautious, data?dependent stance. Inflation in the euro area has cooled from its peak, but core pressures and wage dynamics keep the ECB nervous. Markets are already whispering about future rate cuts, but the timeline is uncertain.\nThis is key for the DAX: German exporters, industrial giants, and auto names live and die by financing conditions and global demand. When the market senses that the ECB is closer to easing than tightening, growth stocks and cyclical names get a tailwind. When policymakers sound more hawkish again, the mood flips fast. Right now, the tone is mixed: no fresh tightening panic, but no clear green light for an easy-money party either. That is why the DAX is pushing higher, but with caution written all over the tape.\n2. Germany\u2019s Real Economy \u2013 Industrial Hangover vs. Re?Shoring Opportunity\nGermany has been battling a rough combo: weak industrial output, softer global trade, and post?energy?crisis scars. Manufacturing data has been wobbling between sluggish and outright contraction, and survey indicators have ping?ponged between fragile optimism and renewed pessimism.\nYet, beneath the noise, there is a structural story developing. Europe\u2019s push for energy diversification, green transition, and strategic re?shoring of supply chains can actually create a long-term floor for selected DAX sectors: industrial automation, high?end machinery, and specialized chemicals. The short-term narrative is about pressure, but the long-term narrative is about selective opportunity. That tension is exactly what makes current price action so fascinating: the index is trading as if the worst recession fears are fading, but earnings revisions are still cautious.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar \u2013 FX As A Secret Profit Lever\nThe EUR/USD dance is a hidden driver for DAX valuations. A softer euro tends to be a silent profit booster for export champions like autos, industrials, and certain tech/engineering plays, as their global revenues translate back into more euros. When the dollar is strong, global investors also find European assets relatively cheap in their own currency terms, which can drive flows into the DAX.\nRight now, the FX backdrop is in a tactical tug?of?war: the market is trying to decide whether the Fed or the ECB will pivot more dovishly first. Any conviction that the euro will weaken against the dollar in the medium term is quietly bullish for DAX exporters. But if the euro starts to spike on a more dovish Fed or better European data, that FX tailwind can flip into a mild headwind for earnings.\n4. Energy Prices \u2013 Europe\u2019s Old Nightmare, Still In The Background\nEnergy was the big German scare story in the last cycles. Gas and power prices exploding made industrial margins look fragile"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is trading in a tense, nervous zone where every macro headline can flip the script in minutes. Instead of a clean trend, German blue chips are moving in a choppy range: sharp green rallies get faded fast, and every dip attracts brave buyers trying to front-run the next European rate cut. This is not a sleepy index \u2013 it is a battlefield between long-term bulls betting on a recovery and short-term bears positioning for another leg down in European growth.\nThe current landscape: volatility is elevated, intraday swings are aggressive, and liquidity pockets are thinner than usual around key levels. That cocktail produces fake breakouts, brutal stop hunts, and classic whipsaw price action. Smart traders are not blindly chasing moves; they are mapping zones, scaling in slowly, and keeping risk tight. In other words: this is a market that rewards preparation and punishes FOMO.\nThe Story: To understand where the DAX 40 could go next, you need to zoom out from the candles and look at the macro story hitting German equities from all sides.\n1. ECB rate-cut hopes vs sticky inflation\nOver in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank is trying to thread the needle. Inflation has cooled from the brutal peaks but remains a headache in certain components \u2013 especially services and wages. The market is already whispering about rate cuts, but the ECB is pushing back, talking carefully about being \u201cdata dependent\u201d and avoiding premature loosening.\nFor the DAX, this creates a weird mix:\n- If growth data weakens, rate-cut hopes rise \u2013 which supports valuations but hits earnings expectations.\n- If growth stabilizes, earnings look better \u2013 but the ECB can stay tighter for longer, capping multiple expansion.\nSo the index is basically trapped between macro narratives: too much optimism gets slapped down by hawkish comments, while too much pessimism gets cushioned by easing expectations down the road.\n2. German industrial machine vs global slowdown\nThe heart of the DAX is still classic Germany: autos, chemicals, industrials, and big exporters. These names are ultra-sensitive to global demand, especially from China and the US.\nRecent manufacturing and PMI data have been mixed \u2013 not a full-blown collapse, but definitely not a strong comeback. Think: fragile stabilization with downside risk. Export-heavy giants are feeling the pressure from:\n- Slower demand in China, especially in autos and machinery.\n- Higher financing costs globally \u2013 tough for capex-heavy sectors.\n- Still-elevated input costs in some segments, even though energy is off the crisis highs.\nAt the same time, any hint that global growth might be bottoming gives these stocks a quick relief rally. That\u2019s why the DAX reacts violently to every US data release, China stimulus rumor, or IMF forecast tweak.\n3. Energy, geopolitics, and the German cost problem\nEnergy prices are no longer in full crisis mode, but Germany still has a structural cost disadvantage compared to energy-rich regions. For energy-intensive industries, margins remain under pressure, and investors know it. Geopolitical tensions, shipping disruptions, and policy uncertainties around the green transition keep introducing new risk premia into European equities.\nThis keeps foreign capital cautious. The DAX is not the default global darling anymore \u2013 it has to compete with US tech indices that are cleaner, more profitable, and structurally less exposed to heavy industry risk. That\u2019s why, even when the DAX rallies, you can feel the hesitation: the moves often look like short covering and tactical flows rather than a confident, long-ter"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is locked in a tense, emotional stand-off. No flash crash, no euphoric melt-up \u2013 just a nervous, choppy zone where every headline about the European Central Bank, German industry, or energy prices triggers sharp intraday swings. We are talking classic sideways chop with spikes in both directions, the kind of tape that punishes late chasers and rewards disciplined traders who already know their plan before the opening bell.\nRight now the German blue-chip index is hovering near an important region where previous upward momentum has started to stall. Instead of screaming to fresh highs, price action is hesitating: candles with long wicks, fake breakouts, and fast reversals on intraday timeframes. That is the market telling you: uncertainty is king.\nFor bulls, the vibe is: \"Buy the dip, but only if the structure holds.\" For bears, it is: \"This is the distribution phase before the real move down.\" The fear and greed indicator for Europe is not at panic, but clearly off the euphoric extremes we saw when rate-cut expectations were at peak hype. Sentiment is mixed, fragile, and easily pushed around by macro data.\nThe Story: What is driving this DAX mood swing? It is a three-layer narrative: the ECB, the German economy, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 from hiking fear to policy limbo\nAfter the aggressive rate-hike cycle, markets had been front-running a full pivot into a more dovish stance. Recently, however, ECB communication has turned more cautious. Policymakers keep repeating the same line: inflation is moving down, but not enough to declare victory. That means the central bank is in \"wait-and-see\" mode rather than full-blown easing.\nThis matters hugely for the DAX 40. Rate-sensitive sectors like tech, real estate, and some financials are caught between hope and fear. On one hand, lower yields in the future would support valuations and new capital flows into equities. On the other hand, if the ECB cuts too slowly, growth stays under pressure. The result is this indecisive price action: not a clear bull trend, not a full-on bear market, just an extended consolidation with violent swings around ECB meeting weeks and inflation releases.\n2. German Macro \u2013 industrial hangover, energy costs, and exports\nThe backbone of the DAX \u2013 autos, industrials, chemicals, and exporters \u2013 is battling a messy macro environment:\n- Manufacturing & exports: German factory data has been sending mixed signals. Some months hint at stabilization, others at renewed contraction. The long-term trend still points to a structural struggle as global demand shifts and supply chains reorganize.\n- Energy prices: Energy is not at the extreme crisis levels of the peak shock, but prices remain high enough to squeeze heavy industry and reduce profit margins. Energy-intensive sectors feel the pinch the most, limiting the upside for some of the traditional DAX heavyweights.\n- German consumer & recession fears: Discussion about a technical or even prolonged recession refuses to die. Whenever a weaker data point hits (industrial production, business sentiment surveys, or GDP revisions), sellers step in quickly, especially in cyclical names.\nThis combination puts a ceiling over aggressive bullish fantasies. Yes, the DAX has strong global players, but the home base is still under pressure. That is why every push higher is accompanied by cautious selling from macro-focused funds taking profits into strength.\n3. Global Risk Mood \u2013 Euro vs Dollar, Wall Street, and China\nOn top of that, the global backdrop is a wildcard:\n- Euro vs Dollar: A softer euro tends to help DAX ex"

The index has held below this key pivot zone for the past four-weeks with weekly RSI highlighting divergence since October. The focus remains on possible inflection off this zone with a breach / weekly close above needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nS&P 500 Price Chart \u2013 SPX500 Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; S&P 500 on TradingView\nA closer look at the S&P 500 daily chart shows the index trading within the confines of a proposed near-term descending pitchfork. A decline of more than 3% off the record highs rebounded off the median-line this week with an outside-day reversal on Wednesday closing the week just below the upper parallel. Initial support rests with the 1.618% extension of the monthly decline at 6798 backed closely by the December low-day close (LDC) at 6770. Broader bullish invalidation rests at 6697-6718- a region defined by the 61.8% retracement of the November advance and the objective December low. Note that basic channel support converges on this zone into the close of the month and a break / close below would suggest a more significant high is place and a larger trend reversal is underway.\nA topside breach / daily close above 6983 would be needed to mark uptrend resumption with the next technical consideration eyed at the 1.382% extension of the broader 2020 advance near 7138.\nBottom line: The S&P 500 is trading into pivotal resistance with the monthly range set just below. While the broader outlook remains constructive, the risk remains for near-term inflection off this mark with the bulls vulnerable while below. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 6696 on pullbacks IF the index is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 6983 ultimately needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nNasdaq Price Chart \u2013 NDX Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; NDX on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: The Nasdaq is trading within a well-defined monthly opening-range just below resistance at the 2025 high-week close (HWC) at 25858. The index has been trading within an ascending pitchfork extending off the 2025 low with a failed attempt to breakout in October highlighting the risk for a pullback towards the 75% parallel. Initial support converges on this slope over the next few weeks at the 61.8% retracement of the November rally near 24625.

                "url": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nasdaq-irdm/iridium-communications/news/market-participants-recognise-iridium-communications-incs-na/amp",
                "body": "Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 25% gain and recovering from prior weakness. Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 30% over that time.\nEven after such a large jump in price, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Iridium Communications' P/E ratio of 18.1x, since the median price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio in the United States is also close to 19x. While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.\nRecent times have been advantageous for Iridium Communications as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\nIridium Communications' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 22% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 4,178% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nShifting to the future, estimates from the nine analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 13% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 12% each year, which is not materially different.\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Iridium Communications' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.\nThe Key Takeaway\nIridium Communications' stock has a lot of momentum behind it lately, which has brought its P/E level with the market. While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\nWe've established that Iridium Communications maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.\nIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Iridium Communications, and understanding should be part of your investment process.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Iridium Communications might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s government-led stock market reforms remind me of Japan in 2020. Back then, Japan implemented intense structural reforms that led to a powerful stock rally,\u201d (Anna Hatori, Goldman Sachs analyst, January 14 on the firm\u2019s YouTube channel)\nThe Korean stock market, which has been surging sharply, is now the most-watched investment destination for global capital. The Kospi 200, South Korea\u2019s benchmark index, rose 91% last year and has climbed over 20% this year, ranking overwhelmingly first among major stock markets. Market analysts view this as a signal of structural changes driven by an improving market environment.\nExpectations are growing that Japan\u2019s \u201cstructural long-term bullish trend\u201d could be replicated in South Korea. Japan created a bull market by persistently pushing reforms to enhance corporate transparency and increase returns to shareholders.\nWhat changes occurred in the Tokyo Stock Exchange after government-led structural reforms? Following this trend could provide clues on which stocks to target and what strategies to adopt in the current Korean market.\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Foreign Funds Flock to Large-Cap Stocks\u2026 Stark Contrast\nThe \u201c10 trillion yen market cap club\u201d is a hot topic in Japan\u2019s stock market today. The number of ultra-large-cap companies with market caps exceeding 93 trillion Korean won has significantly increased.\nAccording to Nikkei CNBC on the 23rd, Tokyo-listed companies with market caps over 10 trillion yen reached a record high of 23 as of the end of last year. In 2020, only five companies belonged to this \u201c10 trillion yen club,\u201d but the number grew to 18 in 2024 and 23 last year.\nToyota, an automotive company, ranked first in market cap, followed by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and SoftBank Group. By sector, 10 were manufacturing firms and 13 were non-manufacturing, with non-manufacturing accounting for a larger share.\nNikkei CNBC attributed the rise in mega-cap stocks to foreign capital inflows. Foreign investors focused on buying large-cap stocks with high market caps, driving up their prices.\nLast year, foreign investors\u2019 net purchases in the Japanese stock market reached 5.407 trillion yen, the highest since 2013, when expectations for economic recovery under Abenomics peaked.\nPassive funds, which track indices, are designed to allocate more capital to larger market-cap stocks. As global liquidity flows in, large-cap stocks rise further while small- and mid-cap stocks are relatively neglected\u2014a \u201crich get richer, poor get poorer\u201d phenomenon. Japanese securities firms advise focusing on companies with market caps between 5 trillion and 10 trillion yen, which could join the \u201c10 trillion yen club.\u201d\nA similar concentration in large-cap stocks is already occurring in South Korea. This year, the large-cap index (top 1\u2013100 in Kospi market cap) rose 20%, leading the overall index gain. In contrast, mid-cap stocks rose 8% and small-cap stocks just 1.2%.\nA source from the securities industry said, \u201cForeign funds managing tens of trillions of won inevitably flow into large-cap stocks with high liquidity and large transaction volumes. Small- and mid-cap stocks only attract attention when there are clear events like restructuring or mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\u201d\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Record Dividends\u2026 Catalyst for Domestic Recovery\nThe common keyword in recent bestselling economic books in Japanese bookstores is \u201cdividends.\u201d This reflects growing interest in investments that generate steady cash flow monthly or annually, rather than capital gains.\nBehind the dividend investment boom is the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s stringent corporate value-enhancement policy. Since 2023, the exchange has required listed companies with price-to-book ratios (PBR) below 1 to submit plans for improving corporate value. A PBR below 1 means a company is valued lower in the stock market than its net asset value.\nAt the time, 43% of Japan\u2019s 500 major listed companies had PBRs below 1.

                "body": "Relentless geopolitics has continued to haunt global markets since the turn of the year, and last week offered little respite. What has changed, however, is not the scale of the headlines but the market\u2019s tolerance for them. Investors appear increasingly fatigued by policy uncertainty and abrupt reversals from the US, where confidence has become harder to rebuild with each successive shock.\nThat fatigue showed clearer signs of expression last week. The resurgence of \u201cSell America\u201d trade appeared to gain genuine traction, first manifesting through a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields. The 10-year yield briefly pushed above the 4.3% mark, a move that initially looked technical but increasingly resembled a broader repricing of U.S. risk rather than a shift in growth or inflation expectations.\nAs the week progressed, pressure began to migrate. While yields stabilized and equity markets avoided outright breakdowns, Dollar became the release valve. By the end of the week, the greenback had posted its worst performance in months, falling decisively against every major currency bloc. This was not a targeted or thematic move\u2014it was broad, indiscriminate, and persistent.\nThe scale of Dollar\u2019s underperformance stood out. Losses exceeded 3% against both Aussie and Kiwi, approached 3% versus Swiss Franc, and neared 2% against Euro and Sterling. This was weakness against risk currencies, European majors, and safe havens alike, suggesting something deeper than tactical positioning was unfolding.\nWhat makes the move more unsettling is what it was not driven by. Economic data remained broadly supportive, Fed rate expectations barely moved, and U.S. equity indices finished the week largely confined within prior ranges. The absence of traditional catalysts points instead to a growing policy risk premium being priced directly into U.S. assets\u2014starting with the currency.\nElsewhere in FX, relative winners and losers offered further clues. Kiwi and Aussie topped the performance table, buoyed by domestic data that has revived speculation of rate hikes later this year. Swiss Franc followed closely, hinting that risk aversion has not entirely faded, particularly in Europe. At the other end, Dollar finished last, with Yen not far behind, despite a sharp rebound linked to suspected Japanese intervention.\nAs markets move into the final days of January, the question is where volatility will express itself next. Whether this marks the early stages of a sustained rotation out of U.S. assets, or merely a sharp warning shot, remains unresolved. What is clear is that confidence has been shaken, and the weeks ahead may determine whether this shift hardens into a defining theme for 2026.\nPolicy Volatility, Not the Fed, Drives the Move\nThe most important point about last week\u2019s Dollar selloff is what it was not about. It was not driven by U.S. economic data, which remained broadly resilient. Nor was it about a sudden repricing of Fed policy. In fact, rate expectations were remarkably stable throughout the week, even as the Dollar slid sharply across the board.\nFed funds futures barely budged. Markets remain fully priced for a hold at the upcoming meeting, followed by another likely pause in March (at 85% chance), with June still seen as the first realistic window for a cut, at around 60% chance. That profile has changed little in recent days. If anything, it reinforces the idea that Dollar\u2019s weakness was decoupled from monetary policy expectations.\nEquity markets tell a similar story. Despite intraweek volatility, all three major U.S. indexes ended the week within the prior week\u2019s ranges. There was no disorderly risk-off move, no equity panic, and no sign of forced deleveraging. This was not a classic risk event. Instead, it looked like a rotation within portfolios, not a rush for the exits.\nThat leaves one dominant explanation: policy volatility itself is being repriced. Investors are increasingly uneasy with a U.S. policy environment that feels erratic, unpredic"
