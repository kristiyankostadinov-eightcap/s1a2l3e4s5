                "body": "Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD climbs above $4,250 as Fed rate cut weakens US Dollar\n- Gold price gains momentum to around $4,275 in Friday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- The Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday to cut rates by 25 basis points in a split vote supports the yellow metal.\n- Positive developments surrounding the Ukraine peace deal might cap the upside for the Gold price.\nGold price (XAU/USD) rises to seven-week highs near $4,275 during the early Asian session on Friday. The precious metal extends its upside as the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) quarter-point rate cut drags the US Dollar (USD) lower.\nThe number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased by the most in nearly four and a half years last week, according to the US Department of Labor (DOL) on Thursday. This weaker-than-expected jobs data weighs on the Greenback and provides some support to the USD-denominated commodity price.\nThe Fed decided to cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) in a split vote on Wednesday, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, its lowest level in three years. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal.\nHowever, Fed policymakers signaled a likely pause in further reductions as they monitor labor market trends and inflation that \"remains somewhat elevated.\u201d Markets are currently pricing in nearly a 78% probability that the Fed will hold interest rates steady next month, compared with a 70% odds just before the rate cut announcement, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nHopes for a Ukraine peace deal could undermine a traditional safe-haven asset like Gold. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Kyiv\u2019s delegation spoke with top US officials to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine in a video call after presenting America with a revised 20-point framework to end the war with Russia.\n(This story was corrected on December 12 at 00:30 GMT to say, in the first bullet point, that Gold price gains momentum to around $4,275 in Friday\u2019s early Asian session, not European session.)\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country\u2019s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.\nThe price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in "

Lower rates and a softer dollar typically make gold shine, and this week\u2019s drop in the ICE dollar index to 98.23, plus cooling Treasury yields, only sweetened the deal. With non-yielding assets like gold looking more attractive, investors jumped onboard, especially as jobless claims topped expectations at 236,000. Even though Fed officials only see one more cut in 2026, the market is keeping its guard up \u2013 especially after gold hovered near all-time highs over the past couple of weeks in a tight trading band.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Gold isn\u2019t stepping off the podium.\nLower interest rates and a fading dollar have once again put gold front and center, with investors piling in for some safety and a hedge against uncertainty. The jump in gold prices suggests the metal remains a go-to safe haven as markets digest the Fed\u2019s next steps and patchy economic data. And while Saxo Bank points to a tighter trading range flashing caution, the big question is whether this year\u2019s gold fever has staying power \u2013 or if it\u2019s cooling down for now.\nThe bigger picture: The Fed sets a new global tempo.\nThis latest cut by the US sets the tone for global monetary policy, potentially drawing more cash toward commodities and prompting central banks to rethink their playbooks.

Battle lines are drawn on the Euro short-term technical charts.\nReview my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this EUR/USD technical setup and more. Join live Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In my last Euro Short-term Technical Outlook we noted that the EUR/USD, \u201cbreakout has extended into near-term uptrend resistance and may be vulnerable to a pullback within the multi-week uptrend. From a trading standpoint, losses should be limited to channel support IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 1.1679 needed to fuel the next leg of the advance.\u201d A four-day decline off those highs extended nearly 0.6% off the monthly high before rebounding yesterday with the post-Fed rally now extending nearly 1.5% off the December low. The advance is now testing confluent resistance, and the focus is on today\u2019s close with respect to the upper bounds of the late-November channel.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nNotes: A closer look at Euro price action shows EUR/USD approaching confluent resistance at the October high-day close and the 61.8% retracement of the decline off the yearly high at 1.1731/47. A daily close above this threshold is needed to keep the bulls in control with subsequent resistance objectives eyed at 1.618% extension of the late-November rally and the 2025 high-day close (HDC) at 1.1794-1.1813 and the yearly high-close at 1.1866. Both represents regions of interest for possible top-side exhaustion / price inflection IF reached.\nInitial support now rests with the 100% extension at 1.1679 with near-term bullish invalidation now raised to the November HDC and the weekly open at 1.1634/41. A daily close below this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place and that a larger trend reversal is underway toward the December low / open at 1.1590-1.16 and the October swing low at 1.1542.\nBottom line: The outlook for the EUR/USD remains constructive with the immediate focus on a reaction into near-term uptrend resistance. From a trading standpoint, losses should be limited to 1.1679 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 1.1747 needed to fuel the next leg of the advance.\nKeep in mind we get another bout of event risk next week with the November Non-Farm Payrolls report, CPI on the European Central Bank rate decision on tap.

                "body": "EUR/USD weakens below 1.1750 on US Dollar rebound, Fed rate-cut expectations could cap losses\n- EUR/USD softens to around 1.1735 in Friday\u2019s early European session.\n- The major pair loses ground on firmer USD, but expectations of Fed rate cuts next year might cap its downside.\n- ECB\u2019s Lagarde said policy is in a good place and that the bank could update its projections in December.\nThe EUR/USD pair retreats from a 10-week high to near 1.1735 during the early European session on Friday, pressured by a modest rebound in the US Dollar (USD). The potential downside for the major pair might be limited amid the prospect of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts next year. The final reading of the German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) will be released later on Friday.\nThe US central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, marking the central bank's third reduction of the year. Fed officials were split on the decision to lower rates to a range of 3.50%-3.75%, with policymakers dissenting on both sides. Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell were seen by traders as less hawkish than expected and exerted some selling pressure on the Greenback against the Euro (EUR).\nFurthermore, renewed concerns about the Fed's independence under US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration might contribute to the USD\u2019s downside. Wall Street still views White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett as the most likely candidate to become the next Fed Chair. Analysts believe that Hassett is expected to push for more rate cuts.\nRising bets that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates could support the shared currency in the near term. ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the current monetary policy stance is in a good position. Meanwhile, ECB policymakers Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Gediminas Simkus stated that there is no immediate reason to either cut or raise rates, as the current policy stance is considered to be in a \"good place\u201d.\nTraders will take more cues from the Fedspeak later in the day. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee are scheduled to speak. Any hawkish remarks from Fed officials could help limit the USD\u2019s losses in the near term.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impac"

Meanwhile, the UK Industrial Production is seen rising 0.7% MoM after declining 2% in September, while the annual output is anticipated to fall 1.2% during the reported month, following a 2.5% decline in the previous month.\nHow could UK GDP and Industrial Production data affect GBP/USD?\nAny disappointment from the UK macro data, especially the growth figures, will reaffirm market bets that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates next week and weigh on the British Pound (GBP). The immediate market reaction, however, is more likely to remain limited amid the underlying bearish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar (USD), which continues to be weighed down by the Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish outlook.\nIn contrast, better-than-expected UK economic releases should assist the GBP/USD pair to build on its recent uptrend witnessed over the past three weeks or so. Even from a technical perspective, this week's sustained breakout and acceptance above the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) backs the case for a further appreciation for spot prices. Hence, any corrective pullback is more likely to get bought into and remain limited.\nSome follow-through buying beyond the overnight swing high, around the 1.3435-1.3440 area, will reaffirm the positive outlook and allow the GBP/USD pair to reclaim the 1.3500 psychological mark. On the flip side, the 200-day SMA, currently pegged near the 1.3340 region, should protect the immediate downside, below which spot prices could weaken below the 1.3300 mark and test the next relevant support near the 1.3240-1.3235 zone.\nEconomic Indicator\nGross Domestic Product (MoM)\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly and quarterly basis, is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced in the UK during a given period. The GDP is considered as the main measure of UK economic activity. The MoM reading compares economic activity in the reference month to the previous month. Generally, a rise in this indicator is bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Dec 12, 2025 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 0.1%\nPrevious: -0.1%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

Several analyses lean bullish with targets near 1.3500, using zones like 1.3200\u20131.3250 as invalidation, while others highlight the likelihood of a volatility spike around next week\u2019s UK labour, PMI, CPI and BoE events. For spot traders that translates into a \u201cbuy dips, not breakouts\u201d regime: better risk-reward is found closer to 1.3330\u20131.3350 than chasing fresh highs just under resistance. For options traders, elevated implied volatility can justify structures such as short-dated straddles or strangles around the BoE meeting to monetise a potential large move in either direction, given how binary the policy message could be for GBP/USD.\nDirectional View And Verdict On GBP/USD\nThe data and pricing you supplied point to a clear bias. GBP/USD has broken higher from 1.3000 and is holding above key moving averages and channel support while the Fed is easing and the Dollar is under pressure. At the same time, the BoE is still fighting 4.0% inflation and is unlikely to deliver a deep dovish pivot in one meeting. Under those conditions, the path of least resistance remains upward as long as 1.3275\u20131.3330 holds. The logical target on this leg is the psychological 1.3500 area, with interim resistance at 1.3420 and around 1.3445\u20131.3450. A sustained break below 1.3275, and especially below 1.3200, would invalidate the bullish structure and signal that BoE communication or UK data have flipped the narrative back in favour of USD. On the current information, the stance is clear: GBP/USD is a tactical buy, with 1.35 as a realistic upside objective and 1.3275\u20131.3200 as the key risk zone"

                "body": "GBP/USD and Jobless Data Impact\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions weakened the US Dollar, with the US Dollar Index down 0.40% to 97.73. Meanwhile, UK GDP figures are expected to show a 0.1% increase for October.\nMarket participants await next week\u2019s Bank of England policy decision, with a rate cut to 3.75% anticipated. GBP/USD\u2019s technical outlook suggests potential movement towards 1.3450 if it closes above 1.3400.\nThe analysis indicates the British Pound\u2019s strength against the US Dollar in the current week.\nTrading Strategy and Event Risks\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut combined with soft jobs data is clearly weakening the US dollar, and we need to position for this trend to continue. The immediate path of least resistance for GBP/USD is upward, especially with the pair now trading firmly above the 1.3400 level. This dollar weakness is the dominant theme we should be trading against in the near term.\nGiven the bullish momentum, we should consider buying call options on GBP/USD with strike prices near the 1.3450 or 1.3500 targets. This strategy allows us to capitalize on further upside while defining our risk ahead of next week\u2019s key event risks. This current setup feels reminiscent of the sharp dollar downturn we saw in late 2023 when the market first began aggressively pricing in a Fed policy pivot.\nHowever, we must be cautious about the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision next week on December 18. While a 25 basis point cut is heavily priced in, any signal from the BoE that they are more concerned about the UK economy than expected could quickly reverse the pound\u2019s gains. We will be watching their forward guidance closely for any hints of a more aggressive easing cycle.\nWith both US Nonfarm Payrolls and the BoE decision on the calendar for next week, a surge in volatility is almost guaranteed. We can prepare for this by purchasing option straddles, which would profit from a large price swing in either direction. This protects us if the market has misjudged the central banks\u2019 intentions, which could cause a sharp correction.\nTo add perspective, the recent US jobless claims figure of 236K is notably higher than the figures we saw around this time two years ago; for the week ending December 9, 2023, claims were a much healthier 203K. Furthermore, the BoE\u2019s expected cut to 3.75% marks a significant policy shift from early 2024, when they were holding the Bank Rate firm at 5.25% to combat persistent inflation. This historical context underscores the major economic slowdown that is now driving central bank policy."

Spot prices remain close to the highest level since September 17, touched on Wednesday, and seem poised to register gains for the third consecutive week amid the supportive fundamental backdrop.\nThe US Dollar (USD) selling bias remains unabated in the wake of dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. The US central bank projected just one more rate cut in 2026. Traders, however, are pricing in the possibility of two more rate cuts next year in the wake of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks, saying that the US labor market has significant downside risks and the central bank does not want its policy to push down on job creation. This, along with the upbeat market mood, is seen undermining the safe-haven Greenback and benefiting the perceived riskier Australian Dollar (AUD).\nThe Aussie draws additional support from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance. In fact, RBA Governor Michele Bullock, following the widely expected on-hold rate decision earlier this week, said that the Board discussed what they might have to do if rates need to go up and that it looks like more rate cuts are not needed. This offsets Thursday's mixed Australian employment details and turns out to be another factor acting as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair, backing the case for an extension of the recent strong move up witnessed over the past three weeks or so.\nMoving ahead, there isn't any relevant market-moving economic data due for release from the US on Friday, leaving the USD at the mercy of speeches from influential FOMC members. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment would drive the USD demand and produce some short-term trading opportunities around the AUD/USD pair heading into the weekend.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s larges"

                "body": "The AUD/USD corrected to nearly 0.6630 after hitting a recent peak of 0.6686. Weak Australian job data negatively impacted the Aussie Dollar, with the labour market losing 21.3K jobs in November, contrasting with an expected gain of 20K. The unemployment rate remained at 4.3%, slightly below forecasts. This unexpected job loss has led to a reassessment of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s monetary policy stance.\nOn related fronts, the US Dollar is under pressure following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut interest rates for the third consecutive time. The Fed reduced rates by 25 basis points, setting them at 3.50%\u20133.75%, and indicated the possibility of a rate change by 2026. The US Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the US Dollar against six major currencies, continues to hover near a seven-week low at 98.55.\nRBA Governor\u2019s Statement\nOn Tuesday, the RBA Governor stated that no rate cuts are planned as the risks to inflation tend towards the upside. The recent economic shifts highlight the dynamic cross-currency influences at play between the Australian and US economies. These changes, driven by macroeconomic data and policies, steer the currency pair movements and trade expectations.\nThe unexpected drop in Australian employment is a major signal for the coming weeks. Today\u2019s report, showing a loss of 21,300 jobs instead of the expected 20,000 gain, directly challenges the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent tough talk on inflation. This sudden weakness suggests the RBA may have to soften its stance, putting downward pressure on the Aussie dollar.\nThis jobs data creates a conflict with RBA Governor Bullock\u2019s statement just days ago that rate cuts were not being considered. With the unemployment rate holding at 4.3%, traders are now questioning if that hawkish position can last. The market will be looking for any sign of a policy shift ahead of the RBA\u2019s next meeting in February 2026.\nLooking Ahead\nLooking back, we saw similar situations in late 2023 when surprising economic data caused sharp revisions in rate expectations. All eyes will now turn to the quarterly inflation data due in late January 2026. That report will be critical to determine if this weak jobs number was a fluke or the beginning of a cooling trend that forces the RBA\u2019s hand.\nOn the other side of the trade, the U.S. dollar is weak for its own reasons. The Federal Reserve just delivered its third consecutive rate cut, and the U.S. Dollar Index is sitting near a seven-week low. This dovish Fed policy provides a floor for the AUD/USD pair, preventing a complete collapse.\nThe Fed\u2019s move was supported by recent data showing U.S. inflation continues to moderate, with the November 2025 CPI report coming in at 2.9%. With the Fed signaling only one more potential rate cut in 2026, the dollar\u2019s path of least resistance appears to be sideways or down. This trend should continue unless upcoming U.S. jobs and inflation data in January 2026 show a surprising return of economic heat.\nThis divergence between a suddenly questionable RBA and a clearly dovish Fed points towards increased volatility for the AUD/USD pair. Derivative traders should consider strategies that benefit from sharp price swings rather than a clear direction. Buying options straddles or strangles ahead of the key Australian and U.S. inflation reports in January could be a prudent way to trade the expected uncertainty."

                "body": "Speculation on Japanese Policy\nConversely, the Japanese Yen benefits from speculation about imminent monetary policy tightening in Japan. Bank of Japan Governor noted that conditions for policy normalisation are improving, adding strength to the Yen. Global market caution and expectations of a BoJ rate hike contribute to the Yen\u2019s support.\nThe BoJ policy meeting next Friday is expected to impact currency movements further. As of today, USD performance varied against major currencies, showing its strongest gain against the Australian Dollar. The heat map demonstrates percentage changes among major currencies with USD experiencing varying results against others, including a 0.54% drop against JPY.\nThe current weakness in the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen presents a clear opportunity for us. The divergence is stark, with the Federal Reserve cutting rates while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is openly discussing a rate hike. This setup strongly suggests continuing downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nThe data supports a weaker dollar, going beyond just the recent jump in jobless claims to 236,000. We saw last week\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls report for November come in at just 165,000, missing expectations and confirming the cooling labor market trend. With the latest core inflation figures also easing to 3.5% year-over-year, the Fed has ample reason to signal more rate cuts for 2026, as markets now expect.\nJapanese Inflation Trends\nIn Japan, the case for monetary tightening is building momentum ahead of next week\u2019s meeting. Japan\u2019s national core CPI has remained above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over a year and a half, last printing at 2.7% for October 2025. This persistent inflation gives Governor Ueda the justification he needs to follow through on his recent hawkish comments.\nGiven the high event risk surrounding the BoJ meeting, we should consider buying USD/JPY put options. This strategy allows us to position for a significant drop if the BoJ hikes rates, while limiting our maximum loss to the premium paid. Targeting strike prices below the major psychological level of 150.00 seems prudent, as a break of this level could accelerate selling.\nWe must acknowledge that implied volatility is rising ahead of the meeting, making options more expensive. An alternative is to sell call spreads with strike prices well above the current level, using the premium collected to finance put purchases. This reflects our view that a sharp upward reversal is highly unlikely in the current environment.\nWe should also remember the currency interventions from the Ministry of Finance back in 2024, which occurred when the pair was trading above 152.00. This shows a historical preference for a stronger yen, adding another layer of resistance to any potential upside. A sustained move below 150.00 would be technically significant, likely attracting a new wave of sellers."

                "body": "It\u2019s been a choppy week for USD/JPY, with the pair testing resistance at 157 before the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision, projections, and dot plot. Since then, the pair has tested support at 155, with softer US jobs data weighing on US dollar demand.\nThese swings came ahead of the Bank of Japan\u2019s highly anticipated interest rate decision on December 19. Expectations of a 25-basis-point rate hike to 0.75% have contributed to the pullback in USD/JPY as market focus shifts from the Fed to the BoJ.\nCrucially, market bets on a December BoJ rate hike and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal policy sent 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields to their highest level since 2007 before easing back.\nGiven the BoJ\u2019s upcoming monetary policy decision, rising JGB yields, and the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle, the short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY remains bearish.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn Friday, December 12, Japanese industrial production will face scrutiny, given that BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda saw diminishing US tariff risks to the economy. According to the preliminary report, production increased 1.4% month-on-month in October, after rising 2.6% in September.\nA third consecutive month of rising industrial production would reinforce Governor Ueda\u2019s view that US tariff risks have softened. Crucially, improving demand would also boost jobs and wage growth. Higher wages would likely fuel consumer spending and demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ rate path and a stronger yen.\nYen strength would likely keep USD/JPY on a downward trajectory in the run-up to next week\u2019s BoJ monetary policy decision, with 155 at risk.\nWith the markets betting on a December BoJ rate hike, USD/JPY volatility could intensify on US economic data and Fed rhetoric. On the one hand, markets are speculating on how far the BoJ needs to go to reach normalization. On the other hand, incoming US data will fill the US government shutdown-induced data void, which may materially alter the Fed\u2019s rate path.\nLater on Friday, traders should closely monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches as the dust settles from Wednesday\u2019s monetary policy decision. FOMC members Beth Hammack and Austan Goolsbee are due to speak. Notably, Cleveland Fed President Hammack will become a voting member in 2026, while Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will be an alternative after being a voting member in 2025.\nCleveland Fed President Hammack\u2019s views on inflation, the labor market, and the timeline for a rate cut will influence US dollar demand. The FOMC\u2019s Dot Plot signaled a single rate cut in 2026. Growing calls for a Q1 2026 rate cut would signal a more dovish Fed rate path. A more dovish Fed policy stance would support a bearish short- to medium-term USD/JPY outlook.\nFor context, the CME FedWatch Tool gives a 24.4% chance of a January 2026 Fed rate cut, while the probability of a March 2026 cut rose from 42.2% to 49.6% on Thursday, December 11. Traders should closely monitor sentiment toward a Q1 2026 Fed rate cut, which are likely to influence USD/JPY trends.\nWith markets focused on rate differentials, technical indicators, and fundamentals will give crucial insights into potential USD/JPY price trends.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY remained above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling a bullish bias. While technicals remain bullish, fundamentals are increasingly outweighing the technical structure.\nA drop below the 155 support level would open the door to testing the 50-day EMA. If breached, 153 would be the next key support. A sustained break below the 50-day EMA would signal a bearish near-term trend reversal. A near-term bearish trend reversal would expose the 200-day EMA and 150.\nIn my view, speculation about multiple BoJ rate hikes and a shifting Fed rate path support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook. The BoJ\u2019s view on the neutral rate will be "

                "body": "USD/JPY Analysis: The Yen Recovers Rapidly After the Federal Reserve\u2019s Decision\nOver the past two trading sessions, USD/JPY has fallen sharply, losing more than 1% of its value as price action increasingly favors the yen in the short term. The current selling pressure began to intensify shortly after yesterday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision, which triggered structural weakness in the U.S. dollar. As long as this weakness persists, bearish pressure may continue to dominate USD/JPY\u2019s movements in the sessions ahead.\nWhat Happened with the Federal Reserve\u2019s Decision?\nDuring yesterday\u2019s session, the Federal Reserve announced the long-awaited rate decision: a 0.25% cut, lowering the policy rate from 4.00% to 3.75%. However, the most relevant part came from Chair Powell\u2019s remarks afterward, where he indicated that rate hikes are unlikely in the coming months, while acknowledging ongoing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market. This opened the door to a scenario of neutral or even lower rates heading into 2026, which the market interpreted as a stronger inclination toward additional cuts.\nEven though Powell\u2019s comments were not fully dovish, they were enough to trigger a structural decline in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield, considered one of the safest assets worldwide, has dropped from around 4.2% to levels increasingly close to 4.0%, showing that Treasury bonds are now offering lower returns following the central bank\u2019s decision.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis decline in yields has also weakened the U.S. dollar, as lower Treasury returns reduce demand for the bonds themselves and, in turn, lower foreign capital inflows\u2014directly affecting USD demand. This structural weakness is clearly reflected in the DXY index, which remains below 100 points, now reaching the 98-point area\u2014levels not seen since October\u2014indicating a broad loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nTaken together, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision has triggered a structural weakening of both Treasury yields and the dollar, creating space for the yen to regain ground in the short term. If this dynamic continues, consistent selling pressure could remain on USD/JPY in the sessions ahead.\nThe Bank of Japan May Deliver a Surprise\nAnother factor to watch in the coming days is the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming monetary policy meeting, scheduled for December 18\u201319, where a potential rate hike from the current 0.5% to 0.75% is on the table.\nThis expectation arises because, in recent weeks, BOJ members have emphasized the persistent weakness of the yen, while pointing out that some indicators suggest inflationary pressures could intensify. This has led markets to believe that the BOJ may be preparing to move gradually away from its ultra-low interest rate policy.\nIf upcoming communications confirm this shift and strengthen expectations for 2026, the yen could gain additional momentum. A rate hike would narrow the interest rate differential relative to other central banks, making yen-denominated fixed-income assets more attractive. This could support stronger demand for the Japanese currency and reinforce downward pressure on USD/JPY.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Bearish Bias Strengthens: Since late November, USD/JPY has shown a consistent bearish bias, moving away from the aggressive bullish trendline that had held since October. Although the pair still retains a longer-term bullish trend, recent price action has begun forming lower highs, which could lead to the development of a short-term downtrend if selling pressure continues.\n- RSI: The RSI line now shows a steady downward slope and has fallen to the center area of the 50 level. Continued movement below this threshold could signal a dominance of bearish momentum, potentially reinforcing selling pressure in the short term.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram remains below zero, indicating that the strength of short-term moving averages continues to favor the bearish side.

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.3770 region, nearly unchanged for the day, and seem vulnerable to decline further.\nThe US Dollar (USD) continues with its relative underperformance on the back of dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, the US central bank projected just one more rate cut in 2026. However, comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell lifted bets for more rate cuts next year, which, along with the prevalent risk-on environment, continues to undermine the safe-haven buck and weigh on the USD/CAD pair.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD), on the other hand, benefits from the Bank of Canada's (BoC) hawkish signal that the rate-cutting cycle was over. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday that the current rate is at about the right level to give the economy a boost through a structural transition. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the Fed and validates the negative outlook for the USD/CAD pair.\nHowever, this week's steep decline in Crude Oil prices, to the lowest level since October 21, might keep a lid on further gains for the commodity-linked Loonie and help limit losses for the currency pair. Traders now look to speeches from influential FOMC members for some impetus later during the North American session. Nevertheless, the USD and the USD/CAD pair remain on track to register losses for the third straight week.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian "

                "body": "The Canadian dollar continued its climb this week, touching its strongest level in nearly three months after a combination of stronger domestic data and broad weakness in the U.S. dollar. The loonie traded around 1.3765 per U.S. dollar, which equals roughly 72.65 U.S. cents. During the session, it briefly reached 1.3757, a level not seen since September.\nMuch of this momentum comes from a surprise development in Canada\u2019s trade numbers. Canada posted a trade surplus of 153 million dollars in September, ending seven straight months of deficits. Economists had expected a deficit of more than four billion dollars, so the surplus caught markets off guard and immediately boosted confidence in the currency. The data showed that the Canadian economy has held up better than expected during the ongoing trade tensions with the United States.\nEconomists noted that while progress may not be perfectly smooth, the worst of the tariff impacts appear to be behind Canada. The next major test will come from the 2026 review of the United States Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA has protected a significant portion of Canadian exports from additional U.S. tariffs, so the upcoming review will play a central role in shaping Canada\u2019s trade outlook and the long-term trajectory of the Canadian dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada added more support to the loonie this week. Governor Tiff Macklem said the Canadian economy is showing resilience, even with the challenges created by U.S. trade actions. The central bank left its policy rate unchanged at 2.25 percent. A steady interest rate stance in Canada, combined with easing in the United States, strengthens the relative position of the Canadian dollar. Analysts at Monex Europe said that the Bank of Canada\u2019s approach should continue to support the currency as the U.S. dollar softens.\nThe U.S. dollar index moved lower after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and offered a gentler outlook than markets expected. Lower U.S. rates reduce the yield advantage that the American currency usually holds, which often lifts the Canadian dollar by comparison.\nOil prices, typically a key driver for the loonie, slipped nearly two percent to about fifty seven dollars a barrel as markets focused on peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Even with softer oil, the Canadian currency managed to rise, which highlights how strongly the trade data and interest rate backdrop influenced markets this week.\nCanadian bond yields moved lower as well, following U.S. Treasury markets. The spread between Canada\u2019s ten-year bond and the U.S. equivalent narrowed to its tightest point since September of last year. A narrower gap can reduce downward pressure on the Canadian dollar and reflects shifting expectations around future interest rate paths in both countries.\nTaken together, the combination of a surprise trade surplus, a resilient domestic economy and a softer U.S. dollar has pushed the loonie to its highest point in months. As investors watch the USMCA review and the direction of central banks, the Canadian dollar enters the winter with renewed strength and a more optimistic outlook.\nThe Canadian dollar is currently trading at 1.37774 CAD against the US Dollar."

This surprise came as the US dollar index slid after the Fed dialed back its outlook and trimmed rates, easing pressure off the loonie. The Bank of Canada held its key rate at 2.25% and signaled confidence in the country\u2019s economic resilience, even with some cross-border uncertainties still looming \u2013 especially around the upcoming United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement review in 2026, flagged by TD Economics. Still, with the greenback softening and the BoC staying steady, Monex Europe analysts see more room for the Canadian dollar\u2019s strength to shine.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Markets are rethinking North American bets.\nA stronger loonie is shaking up investor assumptions just as the US dollar index falls back, prompting a fresh look at how money is flowing across North America. Yields on Canadian government bonds have dropped in line with US Treasuries, pushing the yield gap between the two countries\u2019 10-year notes to its narrowest in months \u2013 and nudging some attention back to US bonds. Oil did dip nearly 2% to $57.41 per barrel, which could pressure Canadian exports, but overall, confidence in a steady policy approach is keeping Canada in investors\u2019 good graces.\nThe bigger picture: Trade twists ripple through global good vibes.\nCanada\u2019s latest upbeat data highlight just how much trade momentum and central bank moves can shape the landscape, especially with global economies still adjusting to last year\u2019s policy shakeups. The weaker US dollar signals that investors are searching wider for returns and responding to softer US monetary policy.

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 208.40, easing slightly after climbing to its highest level since August 2008 earlier this week.\nAfter a period of fading conviction, markets are once again largely pricing in a BoJ rate hike. According to the latest Reuters poll, 90% of economists, or 63 of the 70 surveyed, expect the Japanese central bank to raise short-term interest rates to 0.75% from 0.50% at next week's meeting. That marks a sharp increase from 53% in the previous poll conducted last month.\nThe poll also found that about two-thirds of analysts, 37 of 54, see the rate moving to at least 1.00% by the end of next September.\nThe shift in expectations comes as Japan\u2019s inflation readings remain well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. Governor Kazuo Ueda recently said the central bank is getting closer to achieving its inflation objective in a more sustainable way.\nEarlier this month, he also signalled that policymakers will actively weigh the pros and cons of a rate increase at the December monetary policy meeting. Ueda cautioned that waiting too long to raise rates could allow inflation to accelerate sharply.\nIn the UK, the Bank of England (BoE) will also announce its interest rate decision next week, with markets widely anticipating a quarter-point cut. According to a Reuters poll, most economists expect the BoE to reduce the Bank Rate to 3.75% at the December 18 meeting as inflation continues to ease and economic growth remains modest.\nAttention now turns to the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data due on Friday, which could influence expectations ahead of the BoE decision. Alongside GDP, markets will also assess Industrial Production, Manufacturing Production and Consumer Inflation Expectations.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the Australian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY cross has seen some buying around the 208.00 mark, though it retains a negative stance in the early European session. Prices hover around 208.50-208.55, close to the highest level since 2008, reached earlier this week.\nConcerns over Japan\u2019s fiscal situation, due to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s spending plans and slow economic growth, affect the JPY. This diminishes BoJ\u2019s hawkish expectations and supports the GBP/JPY cross.\nBoJ And Market Expectations\nBoJ\u2019s potential rate hike next week limits the JPY\u2019s downside, with Governor Kazuo Ueda noting an increasing chance of economic and price outlooks materialising. A softer risk tone may bolster the safe-haven JPY.\nThe British Pound feels pressure from a slight USD recovery, restricting the GBP/JPY rise. BoJ\u2019s hawkish stance contrasts with market anticipation of a BoE rate cut, urging caution for bullish positions. Traders await BoE Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s testimony and upcoming central bank events, which will influence the GBP/JPY path.\nAndrew Bailey, the BoE Governor since March 2020, succeeded Mark Carney. Previously, he was the Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive and a BoE Deputy Governor. Bailey\u2019s next speech is scheduled for December 11, 2025.\nWe are seeing the GBP/JPY cross trading near 208.50, a level that is exceptionally high when looking back at historical data since 2008. The main focus now is the sharp contrast between the Bank of England (BoE), which is expected to cut interest rates, and the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which is signaling a rate hike. This fundamental divergence suggests that the current peak in the currency pair may be fragile.\nCentral Bank Policy Divergence\nThe expectation for a BoE rate cut next week is very strong, with derivatives markets pricing in a probability of over 90%. This sentiment is supported by the latest UK inflation data from November 2025, which showed a significant drop to 2.5%, moving much closer to the bank\u2019s 2% target. With third-quarter GDP growth for 2025 being flat at 0.0%, the case for the BoE to begin easing its policy is compelling.\nConversely, the BoJ appears ready to exit its negative interest rate policy for the first time since it last raised rates in 2007. Japan\u2019s core inflation has remained above the 2% target for nearly 18 consecutive months, and strong wage growth figures from earlier in the year are providing the foundation for this policy shift. This makes the Japanese Yen likely to strengthen on its own accord.\nConsidering this outlook, we believe the risk for GBP/JPY is weighted to the downside in the coming weeks. Traders could use this opportunity to purchase put options on GBP/JPY, perhaps with a January 2026 expiry, to position for a drop following the central bank announcements next week. This approach allows participation in a potential downward move while defining risk to the premium paid for the option."

                "body": "GBP/JPY finds decent support near 208.00; remains below YTD top ahead of BoE\u2019s Bailey\n- GBP/JPY reverses a modest intraday dip, though it lacks follow-through amid mixed cues.\n- Fiscal concerns and sluggish growth undermine the JPY, lending support to spot prices.\n- The divergent BoJ-BoE policy expectations cap the cross ahead of Bailey\u2019s testimony.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts some dip-buyers in the vicinity of the 208.00 mark on Thursday, though it lacks follow-through and sticks to a negative bias through the early European session. Spot prices currently trade around the 208.50-208.55 region and remain well within striking distance of the highest level since August 2008, touched earlier this week on Tuesday.\nInvestors remain concerned about Japan's deteriorating fiscal condition on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's massive spending plan and sluggish economic growth. This, to a larger extent, overshadows hawkish Bank of Japan (BoJ) expectations, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor behind the Japanese Yen's (JPY) relative underperformance and acts as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe downside for the JPY, however, seems limited amid expectations for an imminent BoJ rate hike as early as next week. The bets were lifted by BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's remarks earlier this week, saying that the likelihood of the central bank's baseline economic and price outlook materialising had been gradually increasing. This, along with a softer risk tone, could support the safe-haven JPY.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, is pressured by a modest US Dollar (USD) recovery. This contributes to capping the upside for the GBP/JPY cross. Furthermore, the BoJ's hawkish outlook mark a significant divergence in comparison to bets that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates next week, which, in turn, warrants caution before placing fresh bullish bets around the cross.\nTraders also seem reluctant and opt to wait for BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's testimony later today. The focus, however, will remain glued to the key central bank event risks next week \u2013 the BoE monetary policy update on Thursday and the crucial BoJ rate decision on Friday. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the GBP/JPY cross and determining the next leg of a directional move.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE's Governor Bailey speech\nAndrew Bailey is the Bank of England's Governor. He took office on March 16th, 2020, at the end of Mark Carney's term. Bailey was serving as the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority before being designated. This British central banker was also the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England from April 2013 to July 2016 and the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England from January 2004 until April 2011.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Dec 11, 2025 09:50\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: -\nSource: Bank of England\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

The firm recently announced it purchased shares of its own spot Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) alongside a significant stake in the trading platform Robinhood. This action speaks volumes about institutional confidence in the digital asset space. Let\u2019s unpack what this means for investors and the broader market.\nWhat Did Ark Invest Actually Buy?\nArk Invest didn\u2019t just dip a toe in the water; it made a deliberate splash. Through its flagship funds\u2014ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF\u2014the firm acquired two key assets:\n- 13,700 shares of ARKB, its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n- 124,427 shares of Robinhood (HOOD), the popular retail trading app.\nThe announcement came via the firm\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account, creating immediate buzz. This move is more than a simple trade; it\u2019s a statement. By buying its own product, Ark Invest is putting its money directly behind its thesis. It demonstrates a level of skin-in-the-game that resonates deeply with both retail and institutional investors.\nWhy Is the Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF Purchase So Significant?\nWhen a fund manager buys their own fund, it sends a clear signal of alignment. Think of it as the ultimate vote of confidence. For the Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF, this purchase serves multiple strategic purposes.\nFirst, it reinforces the fund\u2019s legitimacy and stability to potential investors. If the creators believe in it enough to invest, why shouldn\u2019t others? Second, it provides internal liquidity and support for the ETF in its early trading days. This can help stabilize the fund\u2019s performance and attract further capital inflows.\nMoreover, this action aligns perfectly with Cathie Wood\u2019s long-stated, bullish outlook on Bitcoin and disruptive technology. She has consistently framed Bitcoin as a strategic asset class for the digital age. This purchase is a tangible commitment to that vision.\nWhat Does the Robinhood Investment Tell Us?\nThe simultaneous purchase of Robinhood shares is equally telling. Robinhood has become a central gateway for a new generation of investors entering both stock and crypto markets. Ark Invest\u2019s bet here is a bet on the platform\u2019s growth and its role in democratizing finance.\nConsider the synergy: Ark Invest offers innovative funds like the Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF, and Robinhood provides the accessible platform for millions to buy them. This investment suggests Ark sees continued user growth and engagement on the HOOD platform, which would directly benefit its own products listed there.\nTherefore, this isn\u2019t two separate, random trades. It\u2019s a coordinated strategy that strengthens Ark\u2019s entire ecosystem\u2014from product creation to distribution.\nWhat Are the Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors?\nThis move by a high-profile, innovation-focused asset manager offers several actionable insights:\n- Institutional Validation: Major players are not just watching crypto; they are actively building and investing in its infrastructure.\n- The ETF Era is Here: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are becoming core portfolio holdings for serious investment firms, not just speculative tools.\n- Look for Alignment: When fund managers invest personally in their own strategies, it often indicates stronger long-term commitment.\n- Watch the Ecosystem: Winning investments often come in clusters. Betting on a leading Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF and its primary distribution channel (like Robinhood) is a savvy ecosystem play.\nConclusion: A Vote of Confidence You Can\u2019t Ignore\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest has delivered a masterclass in strategic signaling. By purchasing its own Ark Invest Bitcoin ETF and shares of Robinhood, the firm is demonstrating profound confidence in both the future of digit"

                "body": "Congress is pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to open the door for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans. This comes after a major policy shift from the White House earlier this year.\nOn December 11, members of the House Financial Services Committee sent a formal letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. They urged him to update securities rules so that digital assets can be treated like other alternative investments in retirement accounts.\nLawmakers say Americans saving for retirement deserve more investment choices. They argue that current rules are outdated and too restrictive, blocking millions from accessing new asset classes.\nLawmakers push SEC to act on Trump\u2019s retirement order\nThe House Financial Committee\u2019s push follows directly on the heels of an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in August 2025. The order, titled \u201cDemocratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,\u201d requires federal agencies to expand the investable choices available to retirement planners.\nIt emphasizes that every American should be able to invest in alternative assets when it makes financial sense. It also notes that fiduciaries must assess risks, managers\u2019 experience, and suitability before such choices are included in retirement plans.\nNotably, cryptocurrencies were specifically listed alongside real estate and private equity. This marked one of the most significant federal acknowledgments of digital assets as legitimate investment choices.\nIn their letter, lawmakers praised the White House directive. They said the SEC must now take parallel action to ensure the policy becomes reality. They also highlighted the need to redefine who qualifies as an \u201caccredited investor.\u201d\nStrict rules about investor qualification currently restrict involvement in certain private and alternative investment markets. This program is often only available to wealthy or high-net-worth individuals. And Congress now wants to expand those rules to people with professional licenses, related job experience, or those who can pass a competency exam.\nThese changes would ensure that a wider spectrum of workers, including teachers, nurses, engineers, and skilled laborers, would have access to investments that were once only available to wealthy Americans.\nThe lawmakers also said the SEC should coordinate with the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plan fiduciaries, to agree on the rules. Both agencies, they said, needed to figure out a way to safely and responsibly add alternative assets into 401(k) menus.\nSEC signals a shift in how crypto will be regulated\nThe SEC has been more open on digital assets already under Chair Paul Atkins. He has abandoned the previous aggressive enforcement approach and initiated additional initiatives to clarify regulations. One of his significant projects is \u201cProject Crypto,\u201d a program he has developed to establish the classification, trading, and storage of digital assets.\nAtkins has stated in recent public remarks that a significant percentage of the cryptocurrencies traded on the market today are not securities. This distinction matters especially because, not being classified as securities, assets are subject to fewer restrictions and can be more readily included in retirement plans.\nThe SEC is also considering sweeping reforms that might update the review, approval, and oversight of investment products.\nThe official guidance includes investor protections, as well as clear disclosures for investors who may buy cryptocurrencies, and safeguards for retirement savers, officials say. Supporters say that if the changes become official, crypto-investing retirement options could gain traction.\nDigital assets will be included in standard 401(k) lineups alongside mutual funds and ETFs, at least until they are fully integrated into the market. However, critics argue that this move is risky. They say cryptocurrencies are prone to extreme price fluctuations and could expose retire"

As the second-largest cryptocurrency continues to evolve beyond just a digital currency into a global decentralized computing platform, investors worldwide are asking this crucial question. This comprehensive Ethereum price prediction analysis examines every factor that could propel ETH to new heights or present formidable challenges on its path to $10k.\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Current Market Position\nEthereum stands as the undisputed leader in smart contract platforms, hosting thousands of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces. The network\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake through The Merge significantly reduced its energy consumption by 99.95%, addressing environmental concerns that previously hindered institutional adoption. With over 400,000 validators securing the network and approximately $50 billion in total value locked across its DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain remarkably strong despite market volatility.\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025: The Bull Case Scenario\nLooking toward 2025, several catalysts could drive Ethereum\u2019s price significantly higher. The continued development of Ethereum 2.0, particularly the implementation of sharding, promises to dramatically increase transaction throughput while reducing gas fees. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity expanding their Ethereum-based products could bring unprecedented institutional capital into the ecosystem.\nKey factors influencing the 2025 Ethereum price prediction include:\n- Regulatory clarity in major markets like the United States and European Union\n- Adoption of Ethereum-based CBDCs by central banks\n- Growth of layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism\n- Enterprise adoption of Ethereum for supply chain and identity solutions\nETH Price Forecast 2026-2028: The Scaling Revolution\nThe period between 2026 and 2028 represents what many analysts consider Ethereum\u2019s true scaling phase. By this time, full implementation of Ethereum 2.0 features should be operational, potentially enabling the network to process over 100,000 transactions per second. This scalability could unlock use cases previously impossible due to network congestion and high fees.\nOur ETH price forecast for this period considers:\n- Mass adoption of decentralized social media platforms on Ethereum\n- Integration with traditional finance through tokenized real-world assets\n- Potential ETH exchange-traded fund approvals in additional jurisdictions\n- Competitive pressure from alternative layer-1 blockchains\nEthereum 2030: The Decade\u2019s Defining Crypto Asset?\nLooking toward 2030 requires considering technological developments that haven\u2019t yet been invented. However, based on current trajectories, Ethereum could become the foundational layer for much of the digital economy. The Ethereum 2030 vision includes a fully decentralized internet infrastructure, where identity, finance, and data ownership return to individual control.\nCritical developments for the Ethereum 2030 outlook:\n- Quantum-resistant cryptography implementation\n- Global regulatory frameworks for decentralized organizations\n- Interoperability with other blockchains becoming seamless\n- Potential ETH becoming a global reserve asset alongside traditional currencies\nCan ETH Reach $10k? The Path and Obstacles\nThe $10,000 price target represents approximately a 3x increase from Ethereum\u2019s previous all-time high. For ETH to reach $10k, several conditions must align favorably. First, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization would need to approach $1.2 trillion, requiring significant capital inflow from both retail and institutional investors. Second, the network must maintain its dominant position in smart contract platforms despite increasing competition.\nMajor obstacles to"

                "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto project developing a structured lending protocol, has announced new progress across its roadmap as the team continues advancing through Phase 2. With development moving steadily and community participation expanding to more than 18,400 active investors, the project is gaining more attention as it approaches the next major release scheduled for Q4 2025.\nDevelopment Progress and the Growing Framework\nMutuum Finance is focused on building a decentralized lending system that supports predictable and transparent financial activity. The protocol is being designed with two connected lending environments. Users are able to supply assets such as ETH or USDT and receive mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. This mechanism aims to give lenders predictable yield that reflects real protocol usage.\nBorrowers use a system with adjustable interest levels that respond to the amount of liquidity available in the pool. When liquidity is strong, borrowing can remain more affordable. When the pool becomes tighter, borrowing costs increase. Loan-to-value requirements create structure for collateral. If the collateral value drops too far, liquidation may occur. Liquidators repay part of the loan and receive a portion of the collateral. Mutuum Finance states that this helps stabilize the system during volatile periods.\nPhase 2 of the roadmap has focused on refining these functions. The team reports steady progress with contract behavior updates, interest recalculations, collateral logic adjustments and internal testing for liquidation events. Interface changes have also been made to prepare for user testing during the upcoming V1 release.\nExpanding Community and Consistent Funding Flow\nMutuum Finance continues to see rising participation. Funding has reached $19.250M, and the number of active investors has climbed past 18,400. The team states that this steady growth reflects the project\u2019s visibility and continued engagement around development updates.\nThe presale began in early 2025 with a starting price of $0.01. The token now sits at $0.035, showing a 250% increase as the project moves closer to its testnet launch. This increase reflects broad participation rather than short cycles of interest. Mutuum Finance reports that user activity has remained consistent throughout each roadmap stage.\nOut of the 4B total token supply, 1.82B MUTM were allocated for the presale. This equals 45.5% of all tokens. More than 815M tokens have already been purchased. The distribution model aims to give early users a meaningful share of the supply ahead of the protocol\u2019s V1 testing period.\nPhase 6 allocation has now passed 96%, leaving only a small amount of supply at the current price. Mutuum Finance reports that demand has increased as the available supply continues to shrink.\nmtToken Yield and Protocol Design\nA major part of the project\u2019s design is centered around mtTokens. When a user supplies ETH or USDT, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as borrowers repay interest. This gives users a clear way to track earnings and helps ensure that the protocol\u2019s yield is tied to actual activity inside the system rather than external incentives.\nThe team is preparing mtTokens to play a larger role in later phases. Future tools will expand how users interact with mtTokens once borrowing activity increases. Mutuum Finance states that the goal is to create a lending ecosystem where rewards reflect the protocol\u2019s real growth rate.\nMutuum Finance is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin supported by borrower interest. Stablecoins are important for lending protocols because they give borrowers predictable loan values and increase liquidity. The planned stablecoin will function as one of the central assets inside the protocol once V1 is live.\nLayer-2 expansion is another part of the roadmap. The team intends to deploy Mutuum Fin"

Solana also maintained 100% uptime over the past year and processed a peak daily DEX volume of $35.9 billion.\nThis growth reflects Solana\u2019s growing influence in decentralized finance (DeFi), fueled by fast, low-cost transactions and a reliable network.\n\u201cWhat makes Solana truly unique is its pragmatic, open approach to building the best onchain environment possible,\u201d the report reads. \u201cIf collaborating with competitors leads to better infrastructure, Solana doesn't hesitate. Status quo barriers don't matter here.\u201d\nBeyond infrastructure, the report says competition across Solana\u2019s lending protocols has intensified as platforms try to attract and retain liquidity. Currently, the three largest lending protocols on Solana are Kamino Lend, Jupiter Lend, and Save.\nMoreover, newer protocols are able to reach the top of their respective markets within around six months of launching, which is much faster than on most other blockchains.\nThe report says that DeFi strategies on Solana are also becoming more advanced. It pointed specifically to Gauntlet, a risk-management firm that now oversees about $140 million across several Solana protocols. Gauntlet manages strategies like delta-neutral positions, which are built to mitigate price risk. According to the report, this level of risk management is similar to what large financial institutions employ.\nAt the same time, the user experience is becoming easier, Redstone said, citing the CASH vault on Kamino as one example. The strategy, designed by Gauntlet, gives users access to higher yields with just a few clicks, even though the risk controls that underpin it are complex. This mix of easy interfaces and strong risk management is helping more everyday users participate in Solana\u2019s DeFi markets.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

The benchmark reversed earlier losses to finish 0.2% higher and set its own closing record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, ended down 0.3%.\nYesterday, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq finished up a respective 1.1%, 0.7%, and 0.3% after the Federal Reserve cut its key rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.\nHowever, after the closing bell Wednesday, Oracle (ORCL) reported higher capital spending and lower revenue and operating income than analysts expected. Shares of the cloud infrastructure giant plummeted nearly 11% Thursday and were dragging other AI-related firms, including chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU), which closed down 1.5% and 2%, respectively.\nShares of Broadcom (AVGO) were down 1.6% ahead of its earnings report after the closing bell Thursday, while those of Costco Wholesale (COST), which also reports results after markets close today, were up 1.2%.\nCoca-Cola (KO) stock slipped 1.6% after it said CEO James Quincey would step down in March and be succeeded by operating chief Henrique Braun. Walt Disney (DIS) shares rose 2.4% after it announced a $1 billion investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and allow its copyrighted characters to be used in short-form AI video platform Sora.\nAfter weekly jobless claims rose more than expected and the U.S. trade deficit fell to its lowest monthly level since the pandemic, the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, fell to about 4.10% from 4.15% at Wednesday's close, then rose back to 4.15% at 4 p.m. ET.\nBitcoin was trading around $91,800, down from overnight highs of near $92,800. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, slipped 0.5% to 98.31, its lowest level since October.\nGold futures advanced almost 2% to $4,305 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, fell 1.2% to $57.80 a barrel.\nWhere Are Mortgage Rates After the Fed Rate Cut?\nWith the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates on Wednesday, many homebuyers and homeowners have their eye on mortgage rates, looking for an early signal of where borrowing costs might head next. So far, the reaction has been muted.\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate ended the day flat yesterday at 6.43%, and as of midday Thursday showed a minor dip to 6.39%\u2014a decline that\u2019s directionally lower but not especially meaningful so far.\nJust a week ago, the 30-year average hit a 14-month low of 6.34%. Though rates are a bit higher than that now, they remain near their lowest level since October 2024.\nIt\u2019s a common assumption: When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, mortgage rates should fall too. But that\u2019s not how mortgage lending works. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate primarily influences short-term borrowing\u2014think credit cards, personal loans, and bank savings yields\u2014not long-term loans like mortgages.\nInstead, 30-year mortgage rates respond to a broader set of forces: inflation expectations, housing demand, and the overall economic outlook.\nRead the full article here.\nFed's Deepening Split Clouds the Path for 2026 Rate Cuts\nThe big divisions at the Federal Reserve show no signs of stopping next year, if officials\u2019 brand-new quarterly projections are any guide.\nWhile the Fed is penciling in one cut in 2026, that masks a vast dispersion in the individual forecasts from the central bank\u2019s officials. That projection, after all, is the median view from 19 different policymakers.\nSeven Fed officials are leaning again"

The Russell 2000 index also ended the session at a new high, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point cut on Wednesday.\nBut if investors analyze Thursday's individual stock movements, they will see not all is well with the AI play yet. Oracle shares plunged nearly 11% after reporting on Wednesday weak quarterly revenue, dragging down AI-related names such as Nvidia and Micron.\nIn extended trading, Broadcom shares fell 4.5%. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings and revenue, but CEO Hock Tan appeared to have failed to address worries that their largest customer, Google, might eventually make more of its chips in-house. Rising memory prices would also pressure margins, while the company's chip deal with OpenAI might not be binding.\nThat's why the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% despite other major U.S. indexes hitting records. Putting the two together, that means investors are rotating out of tech into other parts of the market. The S&P 500 financials sector, for instance, closed at a fresh record, buoyed by jumps in Visa and Mastercard.\nEven though the AI theme seems to be under scrutiny, other sectors are performing well on the back of a resilient U.S. economy \u2014 as signaled by Fed officials on Wednesday \u2014 and buoyed by interest-rate cut. So long as nothing throws a spanner in the works, looks like we're all set for a happy holiday season.\n\u2014 CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this report.\nWhat you need to know today\nNew records for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh highs on Thursday, but the Nasdaq Composite, weighed down by Oracle, underperformed and fell. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.5% higher.\nDisney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI. The media giant will also allow Sora, OpenAI's video generator, to use its copyrighted characters, under a $1 billion licensing agreement. \"We think this is a good investment for the company,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC.\nSpaceX will launch IPO in 2026. Elon Musk confirmed the news in a post on X, which follows multiple articles last week about the firm's plans to go public. Musk said over the weekend that reports of SpaceX's $800 billion valuation were \"not accurate.\"\nBroadcom's fourth-quarter results beat expectations. The chipmaker also saw its net income nearly double from a year ago, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter on the back of AI demand. But shares slumped in extended trading.\n[PRO] Where will Oracle go? Analysts are re-looking their price targets for Oracle stock after the firm released a disappointing and confusing earnings report on Wednesday.\nAnd finally...\nIndia's $3.3 trillion opportunity for global fund houses\nThis year, the world's largest fund house, BlackRock, launched multiple mutual fund schemes in India through Jio BlackRock, marking the U.S. firm's reentry after its exit in 2018. The world's fourth largest asset manager, State Street, is reportedly looking to buy a stake in an Indian fund house.\nAccelerating financialization of Indian household savings is driving flows: as more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning.\n\u2014 Priyanka Salve"

                "body": "Green biotech firms to open factories in Grangemouth\nSeverin Carrell\nTwo green biotechnology firms have announced they will build new factories at Scotland\u2019s Grangemouth site which will employ up to 460 people, in the first phase of projects to replace hundreds of jobs lost when the PetroIneos refinery closed down.\nThe projects by MiAlgae, a start-up based in Edinburgh which uses whisky waste to make fish-free Omega 3 oils, and CelticRenewables, which uses whisky and agricultural byproducts to make chemicals, have won \u00a310m in funding from the Scottish and UK governments to build new plants at Grangemouth.\nMiAlgae\u2019s founder and chief executive Douglas Martin said their Omega 3 plant would start production in the second quarter of 2026, employing 75 people. It uses whisky wash, a byproduct, of whisky production to produce plant-based Omega 3 for pet food and fish farm feed.\nMartin said their modular plant, which has been given \u00a33m by the UK and Scottish governments, can be rapidly expanded to eventually create up to 310 jobs. CelticRenewables, which uses agricultural byproducts to make acetone, butanol and ethanol used in cosmetics, chemicals and has been given \u00a36.23m to build a plant expected to employ 149 by 2030.\nThe projects are being funded by the Grangemouth just transition fund and are linked to the Project Willow programme run by Scottish Enterprise to replace the 400 jobs lost when Grangemouth\u2019s refinery closed down earlier this year, fueling a political storm over mounting job losses from North Sea industries.\nIts closure is believed to affect up to 4,200 other jobs in the wider supply chain, intensifying pressure on both governments and Scottish Enterprise to quickly bring in high value jobs.\nJan Robertson, Scottish Enterprise\u2019s director of Grangemouth transition, said both firms were expected to be part of a closely integrated supply and production chain which connected waste and byproducts from farms, food producers and whisky distilleries with bio-energy and bio-technology companies.\nThe investment agency has been in talks with 140 firms interested in investing at Grangemouth: the long-term goal is to see a sustainable aviation fuel refinery and plastics recycling plants built there.\nOracle\u2019s shares have tumbled by up to 15% today after its latest quarterly financial results disappointed Wall Street.\nThe business software company, co-founded by Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison, saw roughly $80bn vanish from its value, falling from $630bn to $550bn in market capitalization and fuelling fears of a bubble in artificial intelligence-related stocks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia, seen as a bellwether for the AI boom, fell after Oracle\u2019s.\nThe drop extended a 11.5% fall during after-hours trading that followed results showing a lower-than-expected 14% rise in revenues to $16bn (\u00a312bn) in the latest quarter.\nInvestors were also spooked by Oracle raising forecasts for its already-enormous investment in AI. It expects capital expenditure to jump by 40% to $50bn, with the bulk of the increase aimed at building datacentres.\nIn a busy day for AI news, Walt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI start-up\u2019s Sora video generation tool to use its characters\u2026.\nBritain\u2019s stock market has ended the day higher, as the City shrugs off AI bubble worries.\nThe FTSE100 share index has closed 47 points higher at 9703, up 0.49%, its highest closing level in a week.\nMetlenEnergy (+5.3%), AshteadGroup (+4.7%) and JDSports (+3.5%) led the risers, with Informa (-3.2%) and Smith & Nephew (-2.7%) the top fallers.\n\u201cUS tech stocks pulled back after Oracle shocked the market with weaker than expected results and plans to keep doling out the cash on AI-related investments,\u201d says Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, adding:\n\u201cNames in the broader AI universe were in the red, including Arm Holdings, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, as tech investors wondered if there has been too much exuberance in the spac"

                "body": "The UK stock market finished Thursday\u2019s session with only modest index moves, but under the surface there were some sharp losers across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 as traders reacted to a \u201chawkish\u201d US Federal Reserve rate cut, fresh short-seller pressure and a flurry of broker downgrades. [1]\nAt the London close on 11 December 2025, Hargreaves Lansdown data showed the FTSE 100 up around 0.1% at 9,667, while the FTSE 250 slipped roughly 0.05% to 21,820. Yet individual names told a more dramatic story: Entain topped the blue\u2011chip fallers\u2019 board, while Ocado, Ceres Power, NCC Group and Zigup were among the mid\u2011cap index\u2019s biggest casualties. [2]\nToday\u2019s biggest UK stock market losers at a glance\nBased on end\u2011of\u2011day data from Hargreaves Lansdown, these were the standout laggards on Thursday: [3]\nFTSE 100 \u2013 top fallers\n- Entain (ENT) \u2013 down about 3.9% to 729.6p\n- Informa (INF) \u2013 down about 1.8% to 913p\n- Associated British Foods (ABF) \u2013 down about 1.7% to 2,093p\n- Smith & Nephew (SN.) \u2013 down around 1.3%\n- National Grid (NG.) \u2013 down roughly 1.2%\nOther notable large\u2011cap decliners included Lloyds Banking Group, Severn Trent, RELX, Games Workshop, Sage and Halma, all off around 0.5\u20130.9%. [4]\nFTSE 250 \u2013 top fallers\n- Ocado Group (OCDO) \u2013 down about 6.2% to 219.95p\n- Ceres Power (CWR) \u2013 down roughly 5.4% to 292.6p\n- NCC Group (NCC) \u2013 down about 4.0% to 134.5p\n- Zigup (ZIG) \u2013 down around 3.7%\n- Sirius Real Estate (SRE) \u2013 down about 3.5%\nPartners Group Private Equity, Investec, Gamma Communications, Serco, Future and Wizz Air also slid between 1.5% and 3%. [5]\nAgainst a backdrop of a finely balanced Fed, weakening UK housing indicators and sector\u2011specific shocks, here\u2019s what drove each of today\u2019s biggest losers, plus what analysts and forecasters are saying.\nMacro backdrop: \u201chawkish\u201d Fed cut and UK housing worries keep markets cautious\nLondon\u2019s early trading tone was set by the US Federal Reserve, which delivered another 25\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut on Wednesday, taking the federal funds rate to a range of 3.5\u20133.75% , the sixth cut since late 2024. The decision was expected, but three dissenting votes and guidance that only one more cut is pencilled in for next year left markets reading the move as \u201chawkish\u201d. [6]\nCommentary from Hargreaves Lansdown noted that, while the Fed trimmed rates, it also signaled a long pause and announced around $40bn per month in Treasury purchases , a form of \u201cQE\u2011light\u201d that didn\u2019t fully convince equity investors to stay risk\u2011on. [7]\nOn the domestic front, a fresh survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed new buyer inquiries in November at their weakest since late 2023 , with a net balance of \u201332% versus \u201324% in October. In London, the balance fell to \u201344%, with RICS pointing to the government\u2019s recent budget and a future high\u2011value council tax surcharge as additional headwinds for high\u2011end property. [8]\nReuters\u2019 morning \u201cUK Stocks \u2013 Factors to Watch\u201d note this highlighted soft housing backdrop alongside Associated British Foods\u2019 ex\u2011dividend date and NCC Group\u2019s full\u2011year results as key drivers for individual UK shares today. [9]\nFTSE 100: Entain tops blue\u2011chip fallers after CFO departure\nEntain (ENT): leadership changes under tax pressure\nEntain was the worst performer in the FTSE 100, finishing almost 4% lower and topping the blue\u2011chip fallers\u2019 table. [10]\nThe slide followed news that long\u2011serving chief financial officer and deputy CEO Rob Wood will step down next year after 13 years with the Ladbrokes owner. He will be replaced by Michael Snape , currently group CFO at Royal Mail parent International Distribution Services (IDS) , who led IDS\u2019s recent de\u2011listing and sale to Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd. [11]\nReuters noted that the change comes just weeks after Entain disclosed an estimated \u00a3200m tax hit following the UK government\u2019s decision to raise taxes on online gaming and sports betting.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.\nStocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.\nBut Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.\nPowell said the Fed is \"well positioned to wait and see\" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a \"one-time\" increase.\nThat put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.\nAlso, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 24 updates- Ines Ferr\u00e9\nDow jumps to record, S&P 500 closes at 6,900 for first time\nStocks touched new highs on Thursday despite a slide in shares of Oracle (ORCL) disappointing Wall Street.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) notched a fresh record close at 6,900, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech names, gained around 1.3%, or more than 600 points.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 0.3%, as Oracle stock tanked 10% following its results, which weighed on the AI trade.\nAI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back more than 1%.\n6,901.00+14.32+(0.21%)At close: December 11 at 4:42:49 PM EST - Ines Ferr\u00e9\nIf Google wins AI race, Nvidia is 'in trouble,' says author of Jensen Huang biography\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\nRead more here.\n- Brett LoGiurato\nRobinhood stock plummets after disappointing November trading volumes\nRobinhood (HOOD) shares dropped as much as 9% on Thursday after the company posted disappointing November trading volumes.\n- Grace O'Donnell\nRivian stock dives after autonomy, AI chip announcements\nRivian stock (RIVN) dived by 9% on Thursday after the company announced a slew of updates at its first-ever \"Autonomy and AI day,\" including ambitious bets on robotaxi tech and an in-house chip.\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports from Palo Alto:\n- Jake Conley\nNatural gas deepens price plummet\nNatural gas (NG=F) continued its stark fall in price on Thursday as winter weather forecasts remain mild and US production continues to run high despite ample stores.\nFutures on natural gas have fallen by more than 16% in the past five days.

The Nasdaq closed down 0.3%. For most of the day, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq marked large losses.\nThe exciting finish can be credited, in part, to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent further pushing the Republican deregulatory agenda. In a letter posted on X, he offered a look into what's next for the Financial Oversight Stability Council, a body set up after the 2010 financial crisis.\nMuch of it focused on how regulatory burden has stymied economic growth. The council will consider \"whether aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and negatively impact economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability,\" it said.\nThe overhaul would be great for lenders. Shares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman soared. Visa and Mastercard were up more than 4% before the closing bell.\nBut at the same time, regulatory bodies taking a more hands-off approach with lenders can also lead to reckless growth.\nSome dip-buying from traders on tech stocks also helped the market. Information technology went from trading down 1.5% intraday to closing at less than half of that loss.\nInformation technology and communication services in the S&P 500 portfolio account for nearly half of the index.\n\"The AI trade is turning into a Game of Thrones,\" wrote Yardeni Research. That's \"too much concentration in just two of the 11 S&P 500 sectors.\"\nHe recommends underweighting the Magnificent 7, anticipating the bull market will broaden to the S&P 493 in 2026."

                "body": "Major stock indexes ended mixed Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closing at record highs but the Nasdaq pulling back as Oracle results dragged AI-tied shares.\nThe Dow surged 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new closing record after setting an all-time intraday high earlier in the session, as investors piled into shares of non-tech blue-chip companies like Visa (V), Home Depot (HD), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The benchmark reversed earlier losses to finish 0.2% higher and set its own closing record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, ended down 0.3%.\nYesterday, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq finished up a respective 1.1%, 0.7%, and 0.3% after the Federal Reserve cut its key rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.\nHowever, after the closing bell Wednesday, Oracle (ORCL) reported higher capital spending and lower revenue and operating income than analysts expected. Shares of the cloud infrastructure giant plummeted nearly 11% Thursday and were dragging other AI-related firms, including chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU), which closed down 1.5% and 2%, respectively.\nShares of Broadcom (AVGO) were down 1.6% ahead of its earnings report after the closing bell Thursday, while those of Costco Wholesale (COST), which also reports results after markets close today, were up 1.2%.\nCoca-Cola (KO) stock slipped 1.6% after it said CEO James Quincey would step down in March and be succeeded by operating chief Henrique Braun. Walt Disney (DIS) shares rose 2.4% after it announced a $1 billion investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and allow its copyrighted characters to be used in short-form AI video platform Sora.\nAfter weekly jobless claims rose more than expected and the U.S. trade deficit fell to its lowest monthly level since the pandemic, the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, fell to about 4.10% from 4.15% at Wednesday's close, then rose back to 4.15% at 4 p.m. ET.\nBitcoin was trading around $91,800, down from overnight highs of near $92,800. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, slipped 0.5% to 98.31, its lowest level since October.\nGold futures advanced almost 2% to $4,305 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, fell 1.2% to $57.80 a barrel.\nWhere Are Mortgage Rates After the Fed Rate Cut?\nWith the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates on Wednesday, many homebuyers and homeowners have their eye on mortgage rates, looking for an early signal of where borrowing costs might head next. So far, the reaction has been muted.\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate ended the day flat yesterday at 6.43%, and as of midday Thursday showed a minor dip to 6.39%\u2014a decline that\u2019s directionally lower but not especially meaningful so far.\nJust a week ago, the 30-year average hit a 14-month low of 6.34%. Though rates are a bit higher than that now, they remain near their lowest level since October 2024.\nIt\u2019s a common assumption: When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, mortgage rates should fall too. But that\u2019s not how mortgage lending works. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate primarily influences short-term borrowing\u2014think credit cards, personal loans, and bank savings yields\u2014not long-term loans like mortgages.\nInstead, 30-year mortgage rates respond to a broader set of forces: inflation expectations, housing demand, and the overall economic outlook.\nRead the full article here.\nFed's Deepening Split Clouds the Path for 2026 Rate Cuts\nThe big divisions at the Federal Reserve show no signs of stopping next year, if officials\u2019 brand-new quarterly projections are any guide.\nWhile the Fed is penciling in one cut in 2026, that masks a vast dispersion in the individual forecasts from the central bank\u2019s officials. That projection, after all, is the median view from 19 different policymakers.\nSeven Fed officials are leaning again"

Omar, a Somali American and Trump target, said he \"needs serious help.\"\nPresident Donald Trump ramped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric in a speech on Tuesday night, repeatedly attacking Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar and complaining about immigration outside of Europe.\n\"Let's have a few from from Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. Do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime. The only thing they're good at is going after ships,\" Trump said as he addressed supporters in Pennsylvania.\nThe speech was billed as an event to sell his economic agenda, but quickly devolved into a campaign-style speech filled with derogatory insults.\nTrump specifically took aim at Omar, a Somali American who represents Minnesota. He appeared to purposefully mispronounce her name and referred to Omar's hijab as a turban.\n\"I love her, she comes in, does nothing but b----. She's always complaining. She comes from a country where, I mean, it's considered about the worst country in the world, right?\" Trump said.\n\"She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out,\" Trump added.\nHis supporters then launched into \"send her back\" chants about the congresswoman, who is an American citizen.\nOmar responded to the remarks, the latest in Trump's attacks on her and Somali immigrants, in a post on X late Tuesday.\n\"Trump\u2019s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help. Since he has no economic policies to tout, he\u2019s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment,\" she wrote.\nTrump admits to saying 's---hole countries'\nTrump on Tuesday also recalled a 2018 meeting in which he told a group of senators behind closed doors that the U.S. shouldn't accept immigrants from \"s---hole countries\" such as Haiti.\nWhen it was reported at the time, Trump himself flatly denied using the expletive.\n\"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor troubled country,\" Trump wrote on X, then known as Twitter.\nABC News reported that in the 2018 Oval Office meeting with senators, Trump expressed frustration over the visa lottery program and asked those in the room why they would want people from Haiti, Africa and other \"s---hole countries\" coming into the United States.\"\nIn his denial then, Trump accused Democrats in the meeting of making up comments attributed to him and said that he \"probably should record future meetings.\" Notably, the president back then did not deny he suggested that America should admit more immigrants from places such as Norway -- comments that were confirmed by multiple sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.\nBut in his speech on Tuesday, Trump embraced the expletive as he boasted about pausing immigration applications from what he called \"third-world countries\" including \"hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries.\"\nSomeone in the audience then yelled the word \"s---hole.\"\n\"I didn't say 's---hole,' you did,\" Trump quipped. \"Remember, I said that to the senators. They came in, the Democrats, they wanted to be bipartisan, so they came in and they said, 'This is totally off the record, nothing mentioned here, we want to be honest,' because our country was going to hell.\"\n\"And we had a meeting, and I say, 'Why is it we only take people from s---hole countries,' right? Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden? Just a few? Let's have a few from from Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. Do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.\"\nABC News' Justin Gomez and Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report."

                "body": "The US Department of Health and Human Services is considering launching a federal men\u2019s health initiative, a source at the agency tells WIRED.\nBrian Christine, who will be sworn in on December 12 as assistant secretary for health at HHS and head of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, called for such an effort Wednesday during a Food and Drug Administration panel on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men. A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.\n\u201cWe have a men's health crisis in this country. Now we need a national strategy,\u201d Christine said as part of a call for creating so-called Men's Health Centers of Excellence across the country that would collaborate with one another, share information, and generate data to inform policy and programs around men\u2019s health.\nParticipants in Wednesday\u2019s FDA panel\u2014which included federal health officials, urologists, experts on male sexual health, and the CEO of a TRT pharmaceutical company\u2014voiced support for expanding the eligibility criteria for TRT and removing testosterone from the FDA\u2019s list of controlled substances. Earlier this year the FDA held a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women and announced in November that it would remove a black-box warning from the medications.\nThe Trump administration has aggressively canceled equity and transgender initiatives across the government and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for research into women\u2019s and LGBTQ health.\nDuring the panel discussion, Christine called attention to men\u2019s health more broadly, pointing out the widening gender gap in life expectancy in the US and that 44 percent of men surveyed in 2023 didn\u2019t get an annual physical. While rates of depression are similar among men and women, men are much less likely to seek treatment, despite suicide rates in the US being much higher in men. Substance abuse compounds that problem, he said, with the majority of opioid overdoses occurring in men.\n\u201cThere are fewer federal programs targeting men's health concerns than women,\u201d Christine said. \u201cNone of this suggests that we should back off our commitment to women's health. No\u2014never. But we do need a parallel track for men's health in this country.\u201d\nChristine also couched men\u2019s health concerns, particularly obesity, as a national security issue. \u201cMen's health concerns truly affect defense preparedness, defense readiness, and the safety of this country against our enemies,\u201d he said, adding that obesity is a barrier to serving in the military.\nHe stressed the importance of promoting \u201chealth-seeking behavior\u201d in men, providing insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery following cancer, and improving the quality of care for men in rural areas, where health infrastructure is lacking. Many experts expect the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy to lead to a worsening shortage of health care workers in rural areas.\nChristine is a urologist by training who earned his medical degree from Emory University in Atlanta. Prior to joining HHS, he specialized in men\u2019s sexual health and prosthetic urology, and his practice focused on the treatment of erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, low testosterone, urinary incontinence following prostate surgery, and a condition called Peyronie\u2019s disease that involves the curvature of the erect penis. He is a member of the American Urologic Association, the Sexual Medicine Society of North America, the International Society for Sexual Medicine, and the International Continence Society."

On the 11th in the U.S. stock market, the view persisted that the interest rate cut announced at the previous day's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting would support the U.S. economy. Cyclical and consumer-related stocks were bought, with both the NY Dow and S&P 500 indices hitting new all-time highs on a closing basis. In the Tokyo market, this momentum acted as a tailwind, leading to early buying. By 9:40 a.m., the Nikkei Average had risen 978.87 yen to reach 51,127.69 yen.
