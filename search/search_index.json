Macro Catalysts: - Inflation Data: Expected CPI drop to 1.7% (below ECB's 2.0% target). - Rate Decision: ECB likely to hold rates at 2.0% this year, with hikes anticipated next year. - Euro Impact: Stronger euro weighs on German exporters; weaker euro risks inflation via imports.  </p> <p>Earnings Focus: - Key Releases: Infineon (Wed), Linde, Siemens Healthineers, Siemens Energy, Commerzbank, Mercedes-Benz. - US Earnings: Amazon, Google, AMD, Merck, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, Qualcomm.  </p> <p>Geopolitical Risks: - Iran-US Talks: Easing tensions supporting risk sentiment; potential reversal if talks deteriorate. - Energy Prices: Crude oil declines amid reduced geopolitical risk.  </p> <p>Sector Rotation: - Defensives: Healthcare, utilities, consumer staples (safe havens). - Cyclicals: Autos, industrials, chemicals (sensitive to global demand). - Rate-Sensitive: Financials, growth stocks (driven by yield curve shifts).  </p> <p>German Economic Fragility: - Manufacturing: PMI near contraction territory; weak Chinese demand. - Industrial Output: Unstable, swinging between mild improvement and renewed weakness. - Recession Risk: Germany flirting with technical recession; GDP stagnation.  </p> <p>Volatility &amp;
