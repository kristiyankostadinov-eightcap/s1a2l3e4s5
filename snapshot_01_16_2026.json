Gold is historically considered the premier hedge against runaway price growth, which could justify the metal's 22% surge so far this year.\nBut even as prices have eased to a one-month low amid softer inflation data, Einhorn sees gold continuing to rally for other reasons.\n\"Gold is not about inflation. Gold is about the confidence in the fiscal policy and the monetary policy,\" he said, suggesting that the government has become aggressive on both fronts, altogether contributing to a deficit policymakers are largely ignoring.\nIn his view, gold's appreciation reflects disappointment in the efforts to slim the $1.9 trillion federal budget deficit.\nAdvertisement\nEinhorn pointed to the Department of Government Efficiency, an agency that initially promised to slash $2 trillion in federal spending.\n\"A few months have gone by \u2014 It's like $150 billion, maybe,\" Einhorn said. \"That's enough to cover next year's defense funding spending increase; that's going to get eaten up really, really fast.\"\nThe same goes for tariffs, which the administration touted as a massive boost to government revenue. But Einhorn said the new duties appear set to bring in around $100 billion.\nFiscal concerns will also continue to grow with the new tax policy, with Trump expected to extend his 2017 tax cuts. The bill unveiled by Congress this week is expected to add trillions to the deficit over 10 years.\n\"We're not really concerned about the deficit. There's a bipartisan agreement to do nothing about the deficit until we actually get to the crisis,\" Einhorn summarized.\nIf this continues to propel gold higher, that should continue to boost Greenlight's portfolio. The hedge fund beat the S&P 500 with an 8.2% gain in the first quarter, previously noting that gold's 19% advance made it the fund's \"biggest winner.\"\nHowever, doubt has risen as to whether the precious metal can keep climbing this year. ING expects gold to average $3,128 per ounce through 2025, citing that some tailwinds are losing momentum.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

                "body": "Huitong Network, January 16\u2014 Due to an unexpected drop in initial jobless claims in the United States, the US Dollar Index strengthened and international gold prices came under significant pressure. Data shows that last week, initial jobless claims fell to 198,000, lower than the market expectation of 215,000, reinforcing the market's judgment that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged in the short term. At the same time, a temporary easing of tensions in the Middle East weakened safe-haven buying, further dragging down gold prices. The market is awaiting US December industrial production data and speeches by Federal Reserve officials to assess the path of monetary policy and the subsequent impact of the dollar\u2019s movement on gold.\nIn early Asian trading on Friday, international gold prices continued their downward trend, with spot gold prices falling to around $4,605 per ounce. Stronger-than-expected US employment data pushed the US Dollar Index to a multi-week high, becoming the core factor suppressing precious metals.\nInvestors' expectations for a near-term Fed rate cut have further cooled, with more funds flowing into dollar assets.\nAccording to data released by the US Department of Labor, for the week ending January 10, initial jobless claims dropped to 198,000, significantly below the market forecast of 215,000 and further down from the revised previous value of 207,000.\nThis data indicates that the labor market remains resilient, providing new upward momentum for the dollar.\nPeter Grant, Vice President and Senior Metals Strategist at Zaner Metals, said: \u201cRecent data has made the market take a wait-and-see approach regarding Fed action in the first half of the year, with the US Dollar Index at a multi-week high, which is a significant headwind for gold.\u201d\nIn addition to monetary policy factors, the temporary easing of geopolitical tensions has also weakened gold\u2019s traditional safe-haven attribute. Previously, market concerns about a possible escalation of the Middle East situation had driven gold prices higher, but as tensions have eased, some safe-haven funds have shown signs of exiting.\nFrom the daily chart perspective, after a continuous rise, gold encountered significant technical resistance in the $4,650 area, and the price center has started to fall, with the short-term structure turning from strong to weak. Recently, gold prices have consecutively broken below the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, indicating that the bullish momentum is slowing and the market has entered a correction phase.\nIn terms of momentum indicators, the MACD has formed a death cross at a high level, with the red bars gradually shrinking and turning into green bars, reflecting a significant decline in upward momentum; the RSI has also retreated from overbought to neutral levels, indicating that the previous overheating sentiment is cooling.\nThe Bollinger Bands show the price pulling back from the upper band to near the middle band, with the bands narrowing, suggesting volatility may temporarily decrease. The $4,580 level currently constitutes the first key support, which is also close to the 20-day moving average and a previous consolidation platform. If this support is effectively breached, the bears may target the $4,520\u20134,500 range;\nOn the upside, gold would need to regain the $4,650 level to ease short-term pressure. Overall, the daily chart has turned into a consolidation and correction pattern, and any rebound is more likely to be seen as a technical recovery.\nEditorial Opinion\n:\nThe core logic behind the current gold price pullback lies in the dual pressure of \u201cstrong dollar + cooling safe-haven demand,\u201d rather than a substantial deterioration in real demand. Technical and fundamental factors are resonating, significantly weakening short-term bullish advantages.\nWhen the dollar enters a period of strength, gold usually requires stronger inflation or risk events to restart its upward momentum.

The white metal struggles to extend its rally after posting a fresh all-time high near $93.90 on Wednesday.\nThe asset has come under pressure as the United States (US) deferred tariffs on imports of critical minerals. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump ordered Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"enter into negotiations with trading partners to adjust the imports of critical minerals so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the economy\u201d, Reuters reported.\nThe statement indicates that the US is insufficient to become self-reliant for its needs of critical minerals, which is used in various industries.\nEarlier, the Silver price rallied as traders loaded it significantly in fear of the imposition of tariffs on its imports.\nTechnically, the scenario is favorable for the Silver price in the long run, as it highlights its necessity by the US.\nAdditionally, firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will hold interest rates steady in the policy meeting later this month have also weighed on the Silver price. Theoretically, a pause in the Fed\u2019s monetary easing campaign weighs on non-yielding assets, such as Silver.\nSilver technical analysis\nXAG/USD trades lower at $90.63 as of writing. The 50-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) rises and sits at $90.06, supporting the short-term uptrend as the price holds above it. The 50-hour EMA's upward slope underscores an improving trend-following support.\nThe range shift move by the 14-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the 60.00-80.00 zone to the 40.00-60.00 area suggests that the bullish momentum has terminated at least for now.\nGoing forward, the all-time high of $93.90 will remain a key barrier for the Silver price. On the downside, the price could fall to the January 13 low of $83.62 if it breaks below the January 15 low of $86.19.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consume"

                "body": "Trump puts silver, other critical minerals tariffs on hold\nSilver prices briefly tumbled from record highs after US President Donald Trump said he is holding off on new tariffs targeting imports of critical minerals, easing near-term trade disruption risks\nSilver fell more than 7% on Thursday, retreating from an all-time high above $93/oz, as broad tariff threats receded. However, prices have since recovered much of the earlier decline, signalling that traders are repricing the market\u2019s structural drivers. The recent recovery underscores silver's well-known volatility, which is typically higher than gold due to its smaller market size and dual role as both industrial and investment metal.\nThe decision reduced part of the near-term policy risk premium that had propelled silver to record levels. Despite the correction, silver prices remain more than 25% higher year-to-date, highlighting the strength of underlying market dynamics.\nTrump said the administration would instead pursue bilateral agreements with key trading partners to secure adequate supplies of critical minerals and consider a price floor on imports, with officials expected to report back within 180 days. While tariffs were not ruled out entirely, the shift in tone reduced the immediate disruption risk.\nThe decision follows a months-long Section 232 review under the Trade Expansion Act, assessing whether imports of processed critical minerals threaten US national security.\nThe tariff review covered a broad set of processed critical minerals beyond silver, from lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths and gallium to graphite, platinum group metals and other industrial metals, along with any goods incorporating them such as semi-finished goods and final components used in electric vehicles, batteries, permanent magnets, and electronics.\nSilver flows remain elevated in the US\nUS tariff uncertainty had already pulled significant volumes of physical silver from London to the US, triggering a historic squeeze. This led to a sharp decline in available silver stocks in London, the primary trading hub, amplifying price moves and volatility.\nSilver has outpaced gold sharply, with prices up nearly 150% over the past year, supported by both safe-haven flows and robust industrial demand. This has pushed the gold/silver ratio to just above 50, the lowest level since 2011.\nGold/silver ratio drops to lowest since 2011\nBeyond policy-driven volatility, silver continues to face a structural supply deficit. Mine supply growth remains constrained, as most of the silver production is a by-product of other metals, limiting the industry\u2019s ability to respond quickly to higher prices. At the same time, industrial demand linked to solar, electrification, and electronics remains strong, keeping the physical market tight.\nThis persistent deficit underpins silver\u2019s bullish case and helps explain why prices have remained elevated despite fluctuations in the speculative risk premium.\nVolatility is likely to remain elevated as silver\u2019s dual role as both an industrial and investment metal continues to drive larger percentage swings than gold, especially given its smaller overall market size.\nIn the near-term, prices may consolidate in a range as tariff risks are reassessed and positioning normalises. However, structural deficits, tight physical availability, and ongoing policy uncertainty suggest downside might be limited, with silver likely to remain well-supported on dips. Trade policy developments, macro conditions, and any renewed signs of supply disruptions will remain key catalysts.\nSilver\u2019s role in industrial demand and constrained physical supply support a positive structural backdrop, but risks tied to trade policy and macro sentiment will remain key drivers of price dynamics.\nThis publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The first blog: New shocks, old tools: Revisiting international commodity agreements in a fragmented world.\nFor more than 150 years, various governments and corporations have sought to control oil supply - and, by extension, prices. Early in the 20th century, Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil Trust controlled the industry until its 1911 breakup. Later, seven vertically integrated multinational companies coordinated flows, sustaining a long era of low, stable prices. Since the early 1970s, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been the dominant force in oil markets, contributing to significantly higher prices and greater volatility. Despite OPEC\u2019s endurance and adaptation to shifting market conditions, it still faces the pressures that undermined earlier commodity agreements - new sources of supply and evolving demand patterns.\nPre-1973 oil arrangements\nFollowing the 1859 discovery of oil in Pennsylvania, early producer alliances largely failed to restrict output and stabilize prices. Volatility subsided under Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil Trust dominance until its breakup in 1911. Later, pricing power shifted to seven multinational, vertically integrated firms that coordinated supply chains, moving abundant, low-cost oil primarily from the Middle East and Venezuela to major consuming regions. Low and stable prices allowed post-WWII oil demand growth of nearly 8 percent annually.\nRegulation in the United States reinforced this stability. Beginning in the 1930s, the Texas Railroad Commission allocated production to manage surplus supply capacity, while federal oil import restrictions, introduced in 1959, limited foreign competition.\nBy the early 1970s, however, the system began to unravel, as major oil companies\u2019 dominance weakened, U.S. surplus capacity dissipated, and OPEC \u2014 founded in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela - accounted for roughly half of global oil output. With tightening market conditions, OPEC gained leverage to push for higher prices. The era of low and stable prices had come to an end.\nThe oil market since 1973\nThe 1973 Yom Kippur War triggered output cuts and an Arab oil embargo against the U.S. and its allies, and OPEC quadrupled official prices within months. Large disruptions from the 1979 Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War (1980\u201388) more than doubled prices again. In the early 1980s, OPEC chose to keep prices high by lowering production.\nHigh prices reduced global demand while non-OPEC production surged, especially from new sources, including Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea. In response, OPEC introduced production quotas in 1982, with Saudi Arabia acting as swing producer. As Saudi output collapsed, it abandoned this role in 1985, raising production sharply and sending prices below $8 per barrel by 1986. OPEC subsequently dropped administered price-setting and focused on managing volumes through quotas, allowing market forces to set prices. From 1986 to 1999, oil prices averaged about $18 per barrel amid substantial surplus capacity.\nThe 2000s brought rapid demand growth in emerging economies - led by China - fueling a commodity \u201csuper cycle\u201d that drove oil prices above $130 per barrel in 2008. Prices collapsed during the financial crisis but rebounded above $100 per barrel from 2011 to mid-2014 after OPEC cut production. Meanwhile, U.S. shale output - driven by technology and operational innovation - greatly expanded supply, eroding OPEC\u2019s market share. In response, OPEC raised output, pushing prices below $30 by early 2016, but shale output, however, continued to surge.\nIn response to low prices, OPEC broadened cooperation in 2016, forming OPEC+ with 10 non-member producers to coordinate outp"

                "body": "This blog \u2014 the second in a three-part series \u2014 summarizes key findings from the Focus section of the October 2025 edition of the Commodity Markets Outlook, a flagship report of the World Bank, which dealt with the long history of International Commodity Agreements. The first blog: New shocks, old tools: Revisiting international commodity agreements in a fragmented world.\nFor more than 150 years, various governments and corporations have sought to control oil supply - and, by extension, prices. Early in the 20th century, Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil Trust controlled the industry until its 1911 breakup. Later, seven vertically integrated multinational companies coordinated flows, sustaining a long era of low, stable prices. Since the early 1970s, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been the dominant force in oil markets, contributing to significantly higher prices and greater volatility. Despite OPEC\u2019s endurance and adaptation to shifting market conditions, it still faces the pressures that undermined earlier commodity agreements - new sources of supply and evolving demand patterns.\nPre-1973 oil arrangements\nFollowing the 1859 discovery of oil in Pennsylvania, early producer alliances largely failed to restrict output and stabilize prices. Volatility subsided under Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil Trust dominance until its breakup in 1911. Later, pricing power shifted to seven multinational, vertically integrated firms that coordinated supply chains, moving abundant, low-cost oil primarily from the Middle East and Venezuela to major consuming regions. Low and stable prices allowed post-WWII oil demand growth of nearly 8 percent annually.\nRegulation in the United States reinforced this stability. Beginning in the 1930s, the Texas Railroad Commission allocated production to manage surplus supply capacity, while federal oil import restrictions, introduced in 1959, limited foreign competition.\nBy the early 1970s, however, the system began to unravel, as major oil companies\u2019 dominance weakened, U.S. surplus capacity dissipated, and OPEC \u2014 founded in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela - accounted for roughly half of global oil output. With tightening market conditions, OPEC gained leverage to push for higher prices. The era of low and stable prices had come to an end.\nThe oil market since 1973\nThe 1973 Yom Kippur War triggered output cuts and an Arab oil embargo against the U.S. and its allies, and OPEC quadrupled official prices within months. Large disruptions from the 1979 Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War (1980\u201388) more than doubled prices again. In the early 1980s, OPEC chose to keep prices high by lowering production.\nHigh prices reduced global demand while non-OPEC production surged, especially from new sources, including Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea. In response, OPEC introduced production quotas in 1982, with Saudi Arabia acting as swing producer. As Saudi output collapsed, it abandoned this role in 1985, raising production sharply and sending prices below $8 per barrel by 1986. OPEC subsequently dropped administered price-setting and focused on managing volumes through quotas, allowing market forces to set prices. From 1986 to 1999, oil prices averaged about $18 per barrel amid substantial surplus capacity.\nThe 2000s brought rapid demand growth in emerging economies - led by China - fueling a commodity \u201csuper cycle\u201d that drove oil prices above $130 per barrel in 2008. Prices collapsed during the financial crisis but rebounded above $100 per barrel from 2011 to mid-2014 after OPEC cut production. Meanwhile, U.S. shale output - driven by technology and operational innovation - greatly expanded supply, eroding OPEC\u2019s market share. In response, OPEC raised output, pushing prices below $30 by early 2016, but shale output, however, continued to surge.\nIn response to low prices, OPEC broadened cooperation in 2016, forming OPEC+ with 10 non-member producers to coordinate outp"

                "body": "EUR/USD Falls to Fresh Monthly Low\nThe trend since Christmas Eve has been clear, with EUR/USD setting a consistent pattern of lower-lows and lower-highs. There\u2019ve been a couple of stops along the way, such as last week\u2019s bounce from the 1.1616 level and, before that, a bounce rom a prior point of resistance at 1.1656. But, so far, each rally has been sold aggressively, and bears have continued to exhibit control of the trend, punctuated with this morning\u2019s push down to a fresh monthly low.\nAt this point price is testing the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the May-September major move from last year at 1.1593. Notably, the 50% mark of the same Fibonacci setup plots at 1.1492, which had caught the swing-low on November 21st before EUR/USD went into rally mode and drove up to a failed test of the 1.1800 handle.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD: Big Picture Ramifications\nI\u2019ve been talking about this for a few months now but for EUR/USD, it\u2019s the 1.1500 level that\u2019s of such importance. Like we saw back in November, sellers were able to elicit a test of that level but they couldn\u2019t leave it behind. Historically speaking, this is a significant spot for the pair, as the world\u2019s two most popular currencies have shown a tendency to hold or at least slow trends when interacting with that 1.1500 handle. Even an episode such as 2021-2022, when the US was readying to hike rates, it took the pair about 4-5 months to finally leave 1.1500 behind, and that\u2019s when there was a rather clear fundamental driver. In the heat of the Covid pandemic getting priced-in, it was 1.1500 that helped to mark the top in the pair. And then for a two-plus year period in 2015 through the 2017 open, 1.1500 marked range resistance on multiple occasions.\nThe reason that a round level like 1.1500 can be so impactful draws back to the usage of currencies, from global central banks or multi-national treasury departments. These players can have a forceful role in the FX market and they\u2019re not necessarily looking to speculate for a few pips with the use of leverage; instead, they have to make payroll or manage reserve baskets, and the tests of these major psychological levels can bring on perceived value, leading to reaction, which then leads to a resistance (or support) hold.\nEUR/USD Monthly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Strategy\nDoes this all mean that 1.1500 is unlikely to get broken? Not necessarily, as the above chart illustrates numerous instances where that did take place. More than anything, I wanted to draw back to the fact that it often takes time for a level like 1.1500 to give way, and that\u2019s what began to get tested in the second-half of last year which keeps the door open for another test.\nIt does, however, highlight the danger of chasing on that re-test of 1.1500 as there\u2019s been a propensity for that price to produce pullbacks so far, so for traders that do want to push the short side of the pair, pullbacks and trend continuation setups would likely be the more attractive way forward until evidence presents that 1.1500 might give way.\nFor now, this puts the focus on those prior points of support, such as 1.1616 or 1.1656 for short-term strategies. Or, for longer-term perspectives, the 1.1686-1.1748 Fibonacci zone, which has been a major stumbling block for bulls for more than six months now.\nEUR/USD Two-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro"

Traders\u2019 appetite improved due to Trump moderating his rhetoric on Iran, while data in the Eurozone, failed to underpin the shared currency. The pair trades at 1.1605, down 0.35%.\nUS Dollar advances on solid data, traders reducing Fed cut bets\nWall Street ended the session with gains, a reflection of risk appetite. Upbeat earnings of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) pushed US equity indices higher, while the Dollar was boosted by a solid jobs report.\nThe number of Americans filling for unemployment benefits dipped below estimates and the previous week report. That report and speeches by Federal Reserve officials pushed investors to trim their best of further Fed easing in 2026.\nMonay markets had priced 46 basis points of easing, down from 52 during Thursday\u2019s open, according to Prime Market Terminal interest rate probability tool.\nMoreover, traders digested speeches by Regional Fed Presidents Schmid, Daly, Paulson, Barkin, Bostic and the Fed Governor Michael Barr.\nIn Europe, the docket was scarce with the release of the Eurozone\u2019s Industrial Production report in November and the release of inflation data in France and Spain, both readings for December.\nWhat\u2019s in the calendar for January 16?\nThe Eurozone economic schedule will feature inflation in Germany and Italy.

The New York Empire State Manufacturing Index rebounded in January, rising from -3.7 to 7.7; while the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey far exceeded expectations, jumping to 12.6 versus estimates of -2, signaling a broad-based pickup in regional factory activity.\n- The Greenback reacted positively, rallying to a new yearly high, with the US Dollar Index, which tracks the buck\u2019s value versus six currencies, is up 0.30% at 99.35.\n- Federal Reserve officials delivered a range of views on the policy outlook. Jeffrey Schmid said monetary policy is not particularly restrictive, cautioning that there is no room for complacent inflation. Mary Daly struck a more balanced tone, saying she expects solid economic growth and that policy is well positioned.\n- Meanwhile, Thomas Barkin noted that inflation remains elevated, though he sees signs of stabilization in the labor market. Earlier, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said growth is likely to run above 2% but warned that persistent inflation pressures argue for a restrictive stance. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee added that the latest jobless claims data was unsurprising, reiterating that the Fed\u2019s core priority is returning inflation to the 2% target.\n- Industrial Production in the EZ exceeded forecasts in November, rising 0.7% MoM, defying estimates for a slowdown to 0.5%.

Trump also indicated he could delay action on Iran while moving ahead with trade measures targeting critical minerals and AI chips.\nThe downside of the GBP/USD pair could be restrained as the Pound Sterling (GBP) could find support as stronger-than-expected UK monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data is likely to temper dovish expectations for the Bank of England (BoE). At its December meeting, the BoE signalled that monetary policy would follow a gradual easing path.\nData from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK economy returned to growth, with GDP rising 0.3%, beating forecasts of 0.1%. This followed contractions of 0.1% in September and October after flat growth in August.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterlin"

The currency pair faces potential downward pressure as the US Dollar (USD) draws strength from the latest US Initial Jobless Claims figures. These results have reinforced the belief that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely maintain current interest rates for the foreseeable future.\nAccording to the US Department of Labor (DOL), Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly dropped to 198,000 for the week ending January 10, outperforming the anticipated 215,000 and down from the previous week\u2019s revised figure of 207,000. This data suggests that layoffs remain low and the US job market continues to show resilience, even as borrowing costs remain elevated.\nThe US Dollar could receive further support, as Fed funds futures now anticipate the next rate reduction to occur in June, a shift attributed to robust employment data and ongoing concerns among policymakers about persistent inflation. In related news, US President Donald Trump stated he has no intention of removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, despite reports of possible Justice Department indictments. Trump also mentioned he may postpone decisions regarding Iran, while advancing trade initiatives focused on critical minerals and AI chip technology.\nOn the other hand, losses for GBP/USD may be limited, as the British Pound (GBP) could benefit from stronger-than-expected UK monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) results. This positive economic data may reduce expectations for aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of England (BoE), which, during its December meeting, indicated a gradual approach to policy loosening.\nFigures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed that the UK economy expanded by 0.3%, surpassing the forecasted 0.1% growth. This improvement follows two consecutive months of 0.1% contraction in September and October, after stagnant performance in August."

This was also ahead of the 0.1% forecast and marked the strongest monthly reading since June.\nDelving deeper into the figures, GDP was boosted by a 0.3% expansion in services and a 2.1% increase in manufacturing, as car production normalised following a cyber incident at Jaguar Land Rover. The UK economy grew despite uncertainty in the run-up to the budget, which is encouraging. With the worst uncertainty behind businesses, growth momentum could continue in the coming months.\nThe data gives Bank of England hawks sufficient reason to delay voting to ease money policy again soon, making a rate cut in February less likely. Traders have kept expectations for a Bank of England rate cut unchanged, with a 25 basis point reduction fully priced in for June.\nThe USD is rising modestly on Wednesday as investors weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts, Fed independence, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.\nPPI and retail sales data yesterday came in stronger than expected, but they failed to shift rate-cut expectations.\nConcerns about Fed independence were in the spotlight at the start of the week amid speculation that a DoJ investigation into Fed Chair Powell was intended to pressure the central bank to lower rates more aggressively. Trump has calmed these fears, saying that he has no plans to fire Powell.\nAttention will now turn to US trade data and jobless claims for further clues into the health of the US economy and the outlook for rates. The market is expecting the Fed to leave rates unchanged in January, with the next rate cut fully priced in by June.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD\u2019s recovery from the 1.31 November low ran into resistance above 1.3550, before easing lower. The pullback found support at around 1.34, the 200 SMA, and horizontal support, keeping the uptrend intact for now.\nSellers would need to break below the 1.34 level to create a lower low towards 1.3350. A break below here could spark a deeper selloff to 1.3250.\nBuyers will look to rise above 1.35 resistance to open the door to 1.3550 and create a higher high.\nOil prices fall amid easing fears of US military action in Iran.\nOil prices are falling 3% in early trade after President Trump said that the killing has stopped in Iran, easing concerns of imminent military action in the country.\nStrikes could have threatened Iranian crude oil output and key shipping routes, thereby significantly lifting the geopolitical risk premium. Oil prices had rallied 10% in just five days.\nAs the risk premium fades, oil prices are falling around 3%; however, regional tensions remain elevated.\nElsewhere, Venezuela has restarted oil exports, reversing oil production cuts made under a US embargo.\nFurther weighing on US crude and oil prices was data showing that oil and gasoline inventories rose more than expected last week. The EIA report shows crude stockpiles rose by 3.4 million barrels, ahead of expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel draw.\nOn the demand side, OPEC said oil demand is likely to rise at a similar pace in 2027 as in 2026, pointing to a balance between supply and demand that contrasts with other forecasts of a major oil supply glut.\nChina's crude oil imports rose 17% from a year earlier, with the total 2025 imports rising 4.4% according to government data.\nOil forecast - technical analysis\nOil broke out of the falling channel, rising to 62.35, the 200 SMA, and the late October high. The price has now eased lower and is testing support at 60.00, the round number.

Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, whic"

                "body": "AUD/USD is trading close to the 0.6680 area on Thursday, showing little net change on the day as markets balance solid US economic momentum against mixed domestic cues from Australia. Price action remains subdued, reflecting investor caution after a run of data that has reinforced the relative resilience of the US economy while offering limited fresh direction from Australia.\nIn the United States, the latest labour market figures continue to underline economic strength. Initial Jobless Claims fell sharply to 198,000 from the previous 207,000, beating market expectations by a wide margin. Continuing Claims also declined to 1.884 million, reinforcing the view that layoffs remain limited and labour demand is holding up well. These releases add to an already robust macro backdrop, following a notable rebound in US Retail Sales and a Producer Price Index that remains elevated. Together, these indicators suggest that inflationary pressures have not fully dissipated and that economic activity remains firm.\nAgainst this backdrop, Federal Reserve officials have reiterated a cautious and restrictive policy stance. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic warned that inflation pressures could persist beyond the current year and argued that monetary policy should remain tight until there is clearer evidence that price growth is sustainably moving toward target. Such commentary, combined with upbeat data, has helped underpin the US Dollar, limiting upside momentum for AUD/USD despite the pair\u2019s recent stabilization.\nOn the Australian side, domestic developments have offered a more nuanced picture. The latest Consumer Inflation Expectations reading for January edged down slightly to 4.6% from 4.7%. While this signals a modest easing in household inflation outlooks, expectations remain elevated by historical standards, highlighting that price pressures are still a concern. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently left its cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, noting that inflation has moderated substantially from its 2022 peak but remains above the 2%\u20133% target band.\nThis combination of a steady RBA stance and strong US data leaves AUD/USD caught in a narrow range. The Australian Dollar lacks a clear domestic catalyst for a sustained rally, while the US Dollar continues to draw support from resilient growth and cautious Fed messaging. As a result, near-term moves in the pair are likely to remain limited, with traders waiting for clearer signals from upcoming inflation and growth data on both sides of the Pacific.\nTrade Idea:\nConsider selling rallies toward 0.6720\u20130.6750, targeting a pullback to 0.6620, with a stop above 0.6780, as firm US data continues to support the Dollar."

The currency pair drops after Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations fall to 4.6% in January from 4.7% in December, suggesting continued high price pressures.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia maintained the cash rate at 3.6%. Headline inflation slow-down to 3.4% year-on-year in November, yet it remains outside the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target.\nUS Economic Developments\nIn the US, Retail Sales exceeded expectations, rising by 0.6% to $735.9 billion in November. The Producer Price Index (PPI) increased to 3% year-over-year, and the unemployment rate declined to 4.4% in December.\nThese developments support the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged for the upcoming months, possibly strengthening the US Dollar.\nChinese economic conditions and the price of Iron Ore influence the Australian Dollar. The RBA\u2019s interest rate decisions and the Trade Balance also play roles in determining the currency\u2019s value.\nHigh interest rates typically bolster the AUD, and favourable economic conditions in China can increase demand for exports, providing further support for the currency.\nHistorical Context and Current Situation\nA year ago, in early 2025, we saw the AUD/USD pair slip as Australian inflation expectations eased and the US economy showed surprising strength. This combination of a patient Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and a strong US Dollar pushed the pair below the 0.6700 level. This outlook supported a bearish stance on the Australian dollar at the time.\nToday, the situation has become more complex, creating potential for volatility. While Australian inflation did cool for much of 2025, the latest data for the fourth quarter showed headline CPI unexpectedly rose to 3.5%, putting pressure back on the RBA. This renewed inflation concern contrasts sharply with the easing price pressures we were observing this time last year.\nOn the US side, the dynamic has also shifted, as the Federal Reserve did begin cutting rates in the latter half of 2025. The Fed has since delivered three quarter-point cuts, bringing the target rate to the 4.75-5.00% range. Now, the market\u2019s focus is on the pace of future cuts, making every US jobs and inflation report critical for the dollar\u2019s direction.\nMeanwhile, external factors are creating headwinds for the Aussie dollar. Iron ore, a key Australian export, has recently fallen from over $140 to around $125 per tonne amid ongoing uncertainty over Chinese property sector demand. This is a significant drag that was less of a concern in early 2025 when a stronger Chinese recovery was anticipated.\nGiven these conflicting signals, with a potentially more hawkish RBA but weakening commodity prices, traders should prepare for increased choppiness in the AUD/USD. The divergence between Australia\u2019s domestic inflation picture and its external trade environment suggests the pair could see sharp moves in both directions. Derivative strategies that profit from a rise in volatility, such as long straddles or strangles, could be appropriate in the coming weeks."

(Reuters/Illustration/File Photo)\nThe yen was little changed against the dollar on Thursday as investors expected a Bank of Japan intervention to shore up the currency near 160, amid concerns over expanded fiscal spending after the general election.\nA break above 160.00 or the high from July 2024 at 161.95 are viewed as two important potential lines in the sand. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliament's Lower House next week to capitalize on a surge in public support for a new leader who has promised to spur economic growth, tackle cost-of-living concerns and tighten immigration rules.\nThe prospect of an early election has triggered fiscal concerns amid worries about Japan's massive debt load, dragging the yen down and complicating the rate path for the Bank of Japan.\nHowever, this year, conditions may be more favorable to increase fiscal spending. \"In 2026, she (Takaichi) is likely to benefit from a favorable base effect in the consumer price index, as lower rice prices will drive headline inflation to moderate towards 2%,\" said Claire Huang, senior emerging markets macro strategist at Amundi Investment Institute.\n\"This benign inflation environment should buy Takaichi valuable time to advance her economic expansionism agenda.\" The yen was flat at 158.40 per dollar after firming 0.4% on Wednesday as Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama renewed a verbal warning on \"one-sided depreciation.\"\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged policy measures to address FX volatility. It hit its 18-month low of 159.45 on Wednesday. \"Risks are heavily skewed to the downside for the dollar/yen in 2026,\u201d said Stephen Jen, CEO at Eurizon SLJ Capital, mentioning the divergence in policy rate outlook between Japan and the United States.\n\u201cInterventions at the right moment could trigger such a correction,\u201d he added, after arguing the risks are high for the Ministry of Finance to step in.\nFED INDEPENDENCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT\nThe dollar was knocked back on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called out the subpoena from the administration of President Donald Trump, saying it amounted to intimidating the Fed into delivering easier monetary policy, but the greenback recovered its losses the day after.\nAnalysts are split, with some saying the latest episode strengthens the case for global diversification away from the dollar, while others argue there\u2019s a reasonable chance the greenback will ultimately emerge stronger.\n\"Powell could be viewed as more resolutely hawkish in an effort to reinforce Fed independence,\" said Francesco Pesole, forex strategist at ING.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.10% at 99.169, not far from the one-month high it touched last Friday at 99.268, before the subpoena was issued to Powell.\nGERMAN DATA LENDS MILD SUPPORT TO EURO\nThe euro dropped 0.10% to $1.1634, after data showing the German economy edged back into growth after two years of recession. Meanwhile Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the U.S. needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island. French President Emmanuel Macron said a first team of French soldiers was already in place in Greenland and more military means will be deployed in the coming days.\n\"Potential Greenland implications are seen as negative for the euro, but may be less clear-cut if any concerns led to more defense spending and challenged U.S. asset correlations,\" he added. Trump's moves against U.S. major allies triggered a selloff in U.S. assets last April, including stocks and the dollar, raising doubts about the safe-haven status of the greenback. Most analysts see the euro rising against the dollar in 2026 as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates further, though some remain cautious for the near term amid anticipation of another European Central Bank rate cut this year. \"To a good ex"

                "body": "- Yen weakness largely reflects domestic politics and fiscal stimulus expectations\n- Steeper JGB curves highlight market bets on Abenomics-style reflation\n- Past interventions followed rapid moves, not particular levels\n- Intervention would counter Tokyo\u2019s inflation and growth goals,\nSummary\nSpeculation over yen intervention is heating up again as USD/JPY creeps back toward the same danger zone that triggered action in 2024. But this time feels different. Back then, ballooning rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan were the villain. Now, the yen\u2019s slide looks home grown, tied to domestic politics and policy expectations rather than global carry dynamics.\nTalk of a snap lower house election in Japan later this month has added fuel, with traders gaming out a landslide win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaishi and the prospect of aggressive fiscal stimulus. That has reignited chatter about an Abenomics 2.0 reboot, sending both the yen and JGBs, especially the long end, lower in tandem. The correlation between USD/JPY and the Japanese 2s10s curve has spiked, reflecting bets that reflationary policies could be back in vogue.\nAgainst that backdrop, the question is not just whether intervention would work beyond a short-term jolt. It is whether Tokyo even wants a stronger yen if the goal is to turbocharge growth and inflation.\nPrior Intervention Episodes: A Quick Primer\nSource: TradingView\nThe first chart provides context as to what happened prior to recent intervention episodes. It plots USD/JPY with markers showing how far the pair ran beforehand. The contrast is stark. Ahead of the 2024 action above 160, USD/JPY surged almost 10% in a matter of weeks, with later episode following a move of nearly 5%. Compare that to now: barely 3% so far. It is a tiddler, which raises the question of whether the move is big enough to force the Ministry of Finance\u2019s hand.\nHistory from 2022 reinforces the point. Those interventions came after rapid run ups of 12% and 8% respectively, measured in weeks not months. If speed matters more than absolute levels, as recent MoF behaviour suggests, it may require a quick extension into the low 160s to trigger action.\nWe have heard plenty of jawboning from Japanese government officials lately, but most of it repeats the same lines: rapid one sided moves are undesirable, and price should reflect fundamentals. Nothing yet screams imminent intervention if history is any guide. Expect one more round of forceful language before any real move occurs.\nThat brings us to the bigger question: even if the BOJ is asked to act, would it work? The yen\u2019s latest slide looks home grown, driven by domestic politics and reflation bets rather than global rate differentials. That makes any intervention a ultra short-term shock at best, not a trend changer in my opinion.\nDomestic Drivers: JGBs and Steeper Curves\nThe next two charts speak volumes. The first shows Japanese government bond yields across 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 year tenors over the past six months. Every line is pointing higher, led by the back end as term premium ratchets up. Traders are positioning for heavier fiscal outlays to spur growth alongside wage and inflation pressures.\nSource: TradingView\nThe second chart adds to the story. Both the 2s10s (LHS) and 2s30s (RHS) curves have steepened dramatically on Abenomics 2.0 speculation. 2s10s sits at 102 basis points, the widest since 2011. 2s30s is at 234 basis points, the most since 2004. These figures are simply the differential between short and longer-dated Japanese government bond yields. These moves underline growing concern about Japan\u2019s already record sovereign debt burden. Prior reflationary pushes have delivered little lasting success, adding to an already ballooning debt to GDP ratio rather than fixing the structural challenge.\nSource: TradingView\nIt all drives home one point: domestic politics is exerting a major influence on Japanese borrowing costs. And as the next section shows, that same dynamic loo"

                "body": "The USD/CAD currency pair has climbed above 1.3900, nearing monthly highs around 1.3920. This increase is partly due to strong US economic data and a drop in oil prices affecting the Canadian Dollar. The USD/CAD saw a growth of more than 0.2%, recovering from recent lows of 1.3850.\nUS Economic Data Impact\nUS Producer Price Index (PPI) data showed growth, with a 3% increase year-on-year, defying expectations of a 2.7% rise. Additionally, Retail Sales in November rose by 0.6%, surpassing forecasts of a 0.4% increase, despite previous month\u2019s decline. These results may suggest that the Federal Reserve\u2019s current monetary policy is likely to stay unchanged in the near future.\nOil prices have dropped nearly 2% following news from US President Donald Trump about reduced repression in Iran, putting pressure on the Canadian Dollar. Key drivers of the Canadian Dollar include interest rates set by the Bank of Canada and oil prices, as oil is Canada\u2019s largest export. Economic health, inflation, trade balance, and US economic conditions also influence the value of the CAD. Higher oil prices and strong economic data typically strengthen the Canadian Dollar.\nThe USD/CAD pair is showing significant strength, pushing above 1.3700 as we move through mid-January 2026. This move is driven by a familiar divergence between a robust US economy and a Canadian dollar weighed down by falling oil prices. We see this as a key trend for the coming weeks.\nRecent data confirms this view, as the December 2025 US Non-Farm Payrolls report came in strong, adding 210,000 jobs and keeping the unemployment rate at a low 3.8%. Furthermore, the latest US CPI data showed core inflation remaining sticky at 2.8%, reinforcing our belief that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady. This contrasts with growing expectations that the Bank of Canada may need to consider rate cuts later this year to support a slowing economy.\nOil Prices and Canadian Dollar Impact\nAdding to the pressure on the Canadian dollar, WTI crude oil prices have fallen from over $85 a barrel in late 2025 to around $76 this week amid concerns about slowing global demand. This decline in Canada\u2019s primary export directly weakens the currency. The economic policy divergence between the US and Canada is becoming more pronounced, creating a clear path for USD/CAD strength.\nWe saw a similar pattern last year when strong US producer price data combined with geopolitical news that eased oil prices, causing a sharp rally in the pair. History shows that when these two powerful drivers align, the trend can be swift and sustained. It appears this dynamic is reasserting itself now.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests establishing bullish positions on USD/CAD. Buying call options with a strike price around 1.3800, expiring in late February or March, would be a direct way to play the expected upward momentum. We are seeing implied volatility tick up, so these positions should be initiated promptly to capture the move before options become too expensive.\nA more conservative strategy could involve using bull call spreads to limit the upfront cost and define risk. For instance, buying a 1.3750 call and selling a 1.3900 call would offer a solid potential return if the pair continues its ascent as we forecast. Watching the 1.3650 level as a key support is critical, as a break below it could signal a temporary pause in this bullish trend."

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) strengthens against the Greenback amid the rebound in crude oil prices. Traders will take more cues from the US December Industrial Production report and the Fedspeak later on Friday.\nReuters reported on Friday that Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers targeted by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. Rising geopolitical risks boost crude oil prices and provide some support to the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and high crude oil prices generally have a positive impact on the CAD.\nOn the other hand, signs of improvement in the US labor market, along with the robust Retail Sales data released earlier this week, support the case that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep rates on hold for the next several months. This, in turn, could underpin the Greenback in the near term. Morgan Stanley analysts pushed back their expectations for rate cuts to June and September, from January and April, after the US December jobs data.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Thursday that amid ample evidence of stability in the job market, the central bank should be focused on getting inflation down. Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly stated that monetary policy is \u201cin a good place\u201d to respond to economic shifts.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMI"

Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio were \"frank but constructive\", stressing that any proposal undermining Danish sovereignty or Greenland's right to self-determination was \"totally unacceptable\".\nU.S. control of Greenland is \"vital\" for the country's planned Golden Dome air and missile defense system, Trump said in a social media post.\nElsewhere, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted against a resolution that was aimed at curbing President Trump's authority to launch strikes on Venezuela.\nVice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote on a point of order that halted the war powers resolution.\nAdditionally, the worsening employment market has led to predictions of a short-term interest rate drop by the Bank of Canada, which has kept the Canadian dollar (CAD) relatively weak.\nLast week, Statistics Canada revealed that the unemployment rate had risen from 6.5% to 6.8% in December.\nIn the European trading today, the Canadian dollar fell to a 3-day low of 1.3908 against the U.S. dollar, from an early high of 1.3885.

The pair attracts bids as the Pound Sterling (GBP) gains, following the release of the United Kingdom (UK) monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for November.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the economy returned to growth after contracting 0.1% in both September and October.

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF Inflows Accelerate: $1.6B Returns as Price Reclaims $96K\nThe cautious tone that defined the first week of 2026 has shifted materially.\nOver the past two trading sessions, institutional investors have added around $1.6 billion to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, fully offsetting the prior week\u2019s outflows and restoring upward momentum in the market.\nData from Farside Investors and Glassnode shows a clear reversal in positioning, led by sustained inflows into BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The move suggests that sub-$90,000 levels were viewed as an opportunity rather than a breakdown in the broader trend.\nFrom Outflows to Reallocation\nThe opening days of January were marked by consistent ETF redemptions. Between January 6 and January 9, net outflows exceeded $1.3 billion, reflecting short-term risk reduction following year-end strength.\nThat dynamic changed decisively this week.\nOn January 13, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $753.8 million in net inflows, followed by an additional $840.6 million on January 14. The scale and speed of this reallocation indicate renewed institutional conviction rather than tactical short covering.\nAbove: ETF fund flows reverse sharply from early-January outflows to strong inflows on Jan 13\u201314.\nPrice Response Confirms Spot Demand\nThe relationship between ETF flows and price action has remained closely aligned. On-chain data from Glassnode highlights the timing of renewed demand entering the market.\nAs daily ETF inflows exceeded 8,700 BTC on January 14, Bitcoin\u2019s spot price advanced steadily, reclaiming the $96,000\u2013$97,000 range. Notably, this move occurred without a corresponding spike in leverage metrics, reinforcing the view that the rally is being driven by spot accumulation rather than derivatives positioning.\nAbove: ETF net inflows (green) align with Bitcoin\u2019s recovery toward $96K on Jan 14.\nSource: Glassnode.\nBlackRock Continues to Absorb Supply\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT remains the dominant channel for institutional exposure. While flows across other ETFs were mixed, IBIT was the primary driver of net inflows during the two-day rebound.\nAs of January 14, IBIT\u2019s net assets stood at approximately $75.5 billion, reinforcing its role as the primary conduit for large-scale Bitcoin allocation. At current levels, the fund alone represents a meaningful share of daily available liquidity in the spot market.\nAbove: BlackRock\u2019s IBIT net assets exceed $75.5B as of Jan 14, 2026.\nSource: iShares.\nMarket Implications\nThe return of sustained ETF inflows suggests that selling pressure observed in early January has largely been absorbed. With ETFs now holding more than 6.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, continued accumulation at this pace tightens market liquidity and reinforces downside support.\nWhile near-term volatility remains likely, the structure of recent inflows points to strategic allocation rather than short-term positioning. If this trend persists, attention will naturally shift back toward the $100,000 level as the next major psychological and technical threshold.\nThe content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice.

This overwrites Tuesday's three-month-high record inflows of $754 million. In the past three days, the bitcoin ETFs drew in $1.71 billion worth of funds.\nEight out of 12 bitcoin ETFs reported net inflows yesterday. BlackRock's IBIT, the largest bitcoin ETF in terms of net assets, saw $648 million in inflows, while Fidelity's FBTC had $125.4 million. Ark & 21Shares' ARKB reported $27 million worth of inflows alongside positive capital flows spotted in funds from Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Valkyrie, and Franklin Templeton.\n\"The ETF inflows represent a resurgence of institutional demand, signaling that investors are aggressively reallocating capital after a period of year-end caution and de-risking late last year,\" Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, told The Block on Wednesday.\nSpot Ethereum ETFs posted $175 million in positive flows on Wednesday, marking their third consecutive net inflow day. Spot Solana ETFs and XRP ETFs posted inflows yesterday as well, worth $23.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively.\nKronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said that sustained net inflows into crypto ETFs will create a \"structural tailwind\" for crypto prices, which is also supported by improving regulatory clarity.\nBitcoin rose 1.79% in the past 24 hours to trade at $96,447, while ether is trading steady at $3,313, according to The Block's crypto price page.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

DeFi, or decentralized finance, entails the creation of blockchain-based financial services, such as trading or lending, that aren\u2019t reliant on traditional financial intermediaries like banks.\nBitMine shares changed hands around $31.50 on Thursday, a more than 3% dip on the day, according to Yahoo Finance. Although the company is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, with a stockpile that\u2019s currently worth $13 billion, the company\u2019s stock has fallen 21% in the past six months amid broader signs of investor fatigue toward crypto-buying firms.\nIn October, Beast Financial applied for several U.S. trademarks, indicating that the company would provide crypto exchange, payment processing, banking, and insurance services. At the time, not all of the 52 trademarks owned by the company had led to actual products.\nAlex Choi, Donaldson\u2019s key thumbnail strategist, warned on X in December that social media posts touting \u201cMrBeast coin\u201d were not legitimate. The crypto industry has a lengthy track record of scams, stemming from celebrity endorsements or social media hacks.\nIt was unclear how BitMine\u2019s investment would dovetail with its business, which includes the creation of a \u201cMade in America Validator Network.\u201d Validators serve an essential function on Ethereum\u2019s network by validating blocks of transactions, while also earning rewards.\nEarlier this month, Rumble, which positions itself as a free-speech alternative to YouTube, integrated a crypto wallet into its platform for payments and tipping. The feature, backed by stablecoin issuer Tether, supports Bitcoin and tokenized gold.\nDonaldson has been involved in crypto since at least 2021, purchasing NFTs from the storied CryptoPunks collection during the height of the pandemic-era crypto boom. He also promoted a gaming league in 2023 that generated controversy over its use of digital assets.\nIn September, BitMine made its first \u201cmoonshot\u201d purchase, investing $20 million into Eightco Holdings, a crypto treasury firm amassing Wolrdcoin\u2014the native token of the World Chain network co-founded by OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman.\nMonths before, the company indicated in a shareholder presentation that it would make \u201cselect investments in bold ideas that enhance Ethereum Network Value.\u201d"

In a pitch deck shared in early 2025, which was viewed by Business Insider, it described customized offerings that would target MrBeast's audience, supported by financial literacy content. The deck listed nine potential offerings, including student loans, insurance, and credit insights. It said the company would launch by partnering with a fintech company to leverage its existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\nDonaldson has also said he's looking to build a financial literacy-focused channel.\nBeast Industries took in over $400 million in revenue in 2024, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The company lost money last year, mainly because of high costs in its media business. Recently, the company has been on a cost-cutting push as it looks to reduce media-related losses.\nIn 2025, the social media star sought to raise $200 million to extend a $300 million Series C round he'd raised in 2024 at a $5 billion valuation, according to investment materials viewed by Business Insider.\nDonaldson's company has been pitching investors on the idea of building the \"next Disney.\" Like Disney, Beast Industries is looking to expand well beyond video into different product categories."

This integration provides users immediate access to market data without external navigation, significantly amplifying meme coin visibility and engagement.\nBybit Alpha: Solana-Ready Since 2025\nBybit Alpha has rapidly positioned itself at the center of this trend thanks to its early entry into the Solana ecosystem.

                "body": "Major stock indexes finished higher Thursday after two days of losses, while oil prices sank as President Donald Trump dialed down the threat of a U.S. military strike on Iran.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 closed up 0.6%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, with the Dow adding nearly 300 points.\nEarly Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), or TSMC, reported fourth-quarter profit increased 35% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker ended 4.5% higher, and those of Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML (ASML)\u2014which gets a lot of business from TSMC\u2014jumped 5.4%.\nThe U.S. and Taiwan reached a trade agreement Thursday for the Asian nation's semiconductor and technology firms to invest at least $250 billion in production capacity on American soil, including chip factories. In exchange, the U.S. tariff rate on Taiwanese goods will not exceed 15%, according to the Commerce Department.\nMeanwhile, West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, sank about 5% to below $59 a barrel at 4 p.m. ET after President Donald Trump hinted yesterday that he could hold off on attacking Iran, something he had threatened earlier in the week.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, traded above 4.17%, up from Wednesday's close below 4.14%, after U.S. weekly jobless claims came in at 198,000, below expectations of 215,000.\nYesterday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower for a second straight session following the start of bank earnings season. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) stock has declined 5% the past two days after it reported fourth-quarter figures, and shares of its rivals Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell sharply yesterday after they reported their own fourth-quarter results.\nBlackRock (BLK), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) shares advanced 5.9%, 5.8%, and 4.6%, respectively, after they reported Q4 results.\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable public company, rebounded 2.1% after slipping 1.4% Wednesday as the Trump administration said it must meet new security requirements before exporting of its H200 AI chips to China.\nGold futures slipped 0.6% to $4,610 an ounce after hitting their latest record high yesterday. Silver futures set a fresh record of $93.75 an ounce early Thursday and recently were up 0.4% to $91.75.\nBitcoin was trading around $95,100, down from the day's high of about $97,700. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, rose 0.3% to 99.38.\nTSMC's Strong Earnings Sparked a Tech Stock Rally Thursday. What Does It Mean for the AI Trade?\nRecord earnings from contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) sparked big stock gains Thursday, suggesting there's still gas in the tank to fuel the AI rally.\nTSMC on Thursday reported record quarterly profit of 505 billion new Taiwan dollars ($16 billion) on record revenue of more than NT$1 trillion ($33.1 billion). Both figures were well ahead of consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares were up more than 5% in late-afternoon trading.\nWall Street's response to TSMC's results underscored investors' appetite for evidence of AI-driven growth. Shares of chipmaking equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) soared 7% and 8%, respectively, pacing S&P 500 advancers, after TSMC forecast it would increase its spending on equipment and infrastructure by at least 25% this year.\nTSMC's earnings and spending plans also signaled healthy demand for AI chips, boosting the stocks of designers such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO).\nWall Street's attitude toward AI has shifted over the past year. When once investors were happy to reward companies for their AI ambitions, Wall Street is inc"

                "body": "US stock futures edged higher in early trading on Friday, January 16, consolidating their previous day\u2019s gains. Crucially, US equity futures snapped their three-day losing streak, signaling improved sentiment.\nReports of the US lowering tariffs on Taiwanese goods and easing geopolitical tensions drove demand for risk assets. Optimism toward upcoming tech earnings added to the positive sentiment after TSMC announced record quarterly profits and signaled a strong outlook.\nImproved risk appetite, driven by optimism about AI-related earnings, the expectation of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, and strong US economic data, supports a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nThe US cut tariffs on Taiwanese goods. CN Wire reported:\n\u201cThe US and Taiwan agreed to a trade deal lowering tariffs on Taiwanese goods from 20% to 15% and committing $500 billion to American operations, including $250 billion in direct semiconductor, energy, and AI investment and $250 billion in credit guarantees.\u201d\nThe Taiwan TAIEX Index rallied 1.30% in morning trading in response to the trade deal.\nUS futures advanced during the Asian morning session on January 16. The Dow Jones E-mini and the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 35 points and 64 points, respectively, while the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 12 points.\nLater Friday, US industrial production and Fed speakers will influence buying demand for risk assets. Economists forecast industrial production to rise 2.7% year-on-year in December after increasing 2.5% in November. Robust industrial sector activity would signal a strong US economy, aligning with an upswing in service sector activity. For context, the ISM Services PMI increased from 52.6 in November to 54.4 in December.\nBeyond the data, traders should closely monitor Fed speakers for views on the economy, inflation, and monetary policy. Expectations for a March Fed rate cut have fallen sharply, following the Services PMI and jobs report. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March cut dropped from 42.5% on January 8 to 20.6% on January 15. Meanwhile, market bets on a June rate cut remain alive. The CME FedWatch Tool gives a 62.5% chance of a June cut.\nThe current dynamics, including market optimism over AI-related corporate earnings and market bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, affirm a cautiously bullish near-term and positive medium-term price outlook. However, corporate earnings and outlooks are likely to be key for the shorter-term projection.\nFollowing the morning gains, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini traded comfortably above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled bullish momentum, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will depend on corporate earnings, US economic data, and Fed commentary. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish. Optimism about upcoming earnings and expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut support the positive outlook. These fundamentals align with constructive technicals.\nAdditionally, increased speculation about an incoming Fed Chair favoring lower interest rates in an elevated inflation backdrop reinforces the constructive medium-term bias.\nHowever, several events would derail the bullish medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, a robust US economy, a dovish Fed rate path, earnings expectations, and a less hawkish BoJ reaffirm a cautiously positive short-term and a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nNevertheless, traders should monitor 10-year JGB yields, USD/JPY trends, and the Nikkei 225, given the short-term effects of yen carry trades on market liquidity. Yen intervention threats and hawkish BoJ signals may fuel concerns about a yen carry trade unwind, weighing on US risk assets.\nKey levels to watch include a USD/JPY drop be"

The figure was higher than the analyst consensus forecast of 0.1 per cent growth.\nThe ONS confirmed that GDP had fallen 0.1 per cent in October. It also said September recorded slight growth after it had initially reported a contraction for that month.\nGrowth during the September to November period was \u201cled by growth in the services sector\u201d, Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said.\nA Treasury spokesperson said in a separate statement there was \u201cmore to do\u201d to boost growth and to focus on \u201ckeeping inflation low and stable, tackling the cost of living and bringing our borrowing costs down\u201d.\nThe November data marks the first major official reading on the UK economy since the start of the year and comes ahead of unemployment and inflation figures due next week.\nFollowing the GDP release, analysts largely said the Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates this year, with inflation forecast to ease further in the coming months.\n\u201cThe economy should expand at a steady pace through 2026 as inflation eases and real incomes rise modestly,\u201d Ben Jones, lead economist at the business lobby group CBI, said on Thursday.\n\u201cHowever, business investment is likely to remain fairly subdued amid soft demand conditions, high labour and energy costs and supply-side bottlenecks,\u201d he said.\nLondon\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 and the British pound were little changed in early trading following the November GDP figures."

                "body": "Recent data reveals a significant surge in credit card defaults, marking the highest increase in nearly two years. This trend highlights the mounting financial challenges faced by many UK households. Banks reported that more people fell behind on their credit card payments during the last quarter of the previous year, coinciding with a notable drop in mortgage demand\u2014the sharpest in two years, according to the Bank of England.\nExperts caution that these figures reflect growing financial stress among families, exacerbated by a weakening job market and unemployment reaching a five-year peak. Karim Haji, KPMG\u2019s head of financial services, noted that rising unsecured borrowing and reduced mortgage activity point to ongoing affordability issues, with many turning to credit to manage holiday expenses. The uptick in short-term borrowing has directly contributed to the rise in defaults, signaling increased pressure on consumers.\nDespite a modest 0.3% economic growth in November, analysts warn that persistent high interest rates, elevated taxes, and subdued global demand may prevent this momentum from continuing. Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics emphasized that the current pace of growth is unlikely to be maintained under these conditions.\n2:40pm\nThank you for following our coverage as the UK\u2019s GDP exceeded expectations with a 0.3% rise in November. As trading closes, the FTSE 100 is up by 0.4%, while the FTSE 250 has advanced 1.2%. However, UK borrowing costs have increased, diverging from most European government bonds, as traders scale back expectations for Bank of England rate cuts this year.\nOn Wall Street, major indices opened higher, buoyed by strong earnings from TSMC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. The Dow Jones is up 0.4%, the S&P 500 has gained 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite is ahead by 0.7%.\n2:01pm\nOil prices dropped sharply after Donald Trump stepped back from threats of military action against Iran. Brent crude fell to $63.89 per barrel in early Thursday trading, a 3.9% decrease from the previous day\u2019s three-month high of nearly $67. The decline followed Trump\u2019s comments that he would \u201cwatch and see\u201d regarding potential intervention, and his assurance that protester deaths in Iran had ceased.\n1:44pm\nIn the United States, applications for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to 198,000 for the week ending January 10, outperforming analyst expectations of 215,000. The four-week average also declined, and the total number of Americans receiving jobless benefits dropped by 19,000 to 1.88 million. These figures suggest that layoffs remain low, even as concerns about the labor market persist.\n1:20pm\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimates that the UK economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter, with GDP rising 1.4% last year. Improvements in private sector activity signal a tentative increase in business confidence ahead of the 2025 Budget. Senior economist Ben Caswell noted that the Chancellor\u2019s recent fiscal measures have helped ease uncertainty around future tax policy.\n1:04pm\nUS stock markets are poised for gains, driven by renewed enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. TSMC, a leading AI chip manufacturer, forecasts strong annual growth and plans up to $56 billion in capital investments this year. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.8% in premarket trading, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posting gains. However, financial stocks faced pressure due to concerns over potential caps on credit card interest rates proposed by Donald Trump.\n12:08pm\nThe Lord Mayor of London, Dame Susan Langley, warned that exaggerated fears about street crime could deter foreign investment. She highlighted that some international businesses are increasingly worried about safety in the capital, a concern amplified by misleading statements about crime rates.\n11:53am\nDespite better-than-expected economic growth in November, business investment in the UK is expected to stay subdued.

                "body": "The UK economy grew at the fastest pace in five months in November, rebounding better than expected after worries about the uncertainty generated by the budget.\nOfficial figures showed monthly economic output rose by 0.3 per cent, beating forecasts of 0.1 per cent expected by city economists between October and November.\nGrowth in the rolling three months to November was also up by 0.1 per cent of GDP, exceeding forecasts of a contraction of 0.2 per cent, after flat growth in October, the Office for National Statistics said.\nGrowth in November was supported by a sharp increase in car production after Jaguar Land Rover reopened its factories following a major cyber attack in September. The figures suggest that worries about the budget, which was held on November 26, did not hurt output as much as sentiment surveys from businesses and households had indicated. The ONS also upgraded its forecasts for September\u2019s GDP performance from an initial estimate of a 0.1 per cent contraction to growth of 0.1 per cent in the month.\n\u201cThe economy looks better than many assumed at the end of last year, with budget uncertainty likely behind us,\u201d Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank said, adding that quarterly growth at the end of the year would probably come in at 0.2 per cent. The Bank of England has forecast a no growth in fourth quarter GDP.\n\u201cWe will also have a stronger positive carry-over effect into 2026 GDP numbers. Almost certainly, forecasters will start to revise up their 2026 projections in the coming day and weeks, similar to what we saw at the start of 2025,\u201d Raja said.\n\u2022 Manufacturing is vital \u2014 we must hold on to what is left\nThe services sector, which makes up more than three-quarters of the economy, rose by 0.3 per cent in the month, after contracting by the same amount in October. Professional, scientific and technical services were the best-performing part of the sector, expanding by 1.7 per cent in the month, while consumer-facing services contracted by 0.2 per cent after a flat October.\nProduction output, which includes manufacturing, recorded a 1.1 per cent monthly increase, largely down to the normalisation at JLR, which drove car production up by 25.5 per cent and led to a 2.1 per cent jump in manufacturing output on the month. The sector contributed 0.1 percentage points to the economy in November. The construction sector, however, continued to record falling output, contracting by 1.3 per cent after a decline of 1.2 per cent in October.\nThe economy has slowed after a strong start to 2025, when economic data has traditionally outperformed. Annual growth is expected to reach about 1.4 per cent in 2025 but will struggle to match that this year as the economy is hit by restrictive fiscal policy and a weaker labour market, economists said.\n\u2022 UK to be world\u2019s fifth-largest economy by 2040, claims think tank\nAndrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg, said growth could slow to 0.7 per cent in 2026, below a consensus of about 1.1 per cent. \u201cWe suspect the economy will stagnate for a little longer as rising joblessness directly lowers household income and encourages those in work to keep saving a large share of their income for fear of redundancy,\u201d he said.\nThe pound traded flat against the euro and the dollar on Thursday morning and UK government bonds rallied, causing yields to fall by 0.04 percentage points on ten-year debt to 4.14 per cent. Yields on longer-term 30-year bonds slid by 0.02 percentage points to 5.12 per cent and stocks on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 opened in the green.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cTo make the economy work for working people, we are reversing years of underinvestment \u2026 There\u2019s more to do \u2014 driving growth, delivering the consolidation to provide stability, keeping inflation low and stable, tackling the cost of living and bringing our borrowing costs down.\u201d\n\u2022 Economists say UK unemployment may reach an 11-year high in 2026\nConsumer price inflation is also on course to hit the"

Energy lagged after oil futures fell about 4%, reflecting concerns over slowing demand.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose slightly. The two-year yield increased three basis points to 3.55%, while the 10-year yield ticked up to 4.14%, as investors reduced bond holdings.\nEconomic data added to a cautiously positive market mood. Initial jobless claims fell to 198,000 for the week ended Jan. 10, below expectations of 215,000. The Empire State Manufacturing Index rose to 7.7, above the 1.0 consensus, suggesting stronger activity in New York factories.\nAnalysts said trade policy signals and steady economic indicators may keep equities supported, even as uncertainty around energy and interest rates persists."

                "body": "The major U.S. stock indexes are rebounding shortly after the mid-session on Thursday, helped by a chip-fueled jump after TSM released blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings reports. Strong earnings results from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also brought back buyers after a two-day setback.\nAt 18:16 GMT, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading 49523.28, up 373.65 or +0.76%. The benchmark S&P 500 Index is at 6968.98, up 42.38 or +0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite is trading 23665.68, up 193.93, up 0.83%.\nIn my opinion, the biggest factor driving the price action is the lifting of one of the major uncertainties that had been encouraging investors to lighten positions earlier this week. That uncertainty was whether President Trump would order a military strike on Iran in response to Iran\u2019s crackdown on widespread protests.\nThe futures markets stabilized overnight after Trump said he might hold off on attacking Iran, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping\u2026and there\u2019s no plan for executions.\u201d\nThe buying is so strong today that stock market traders were even unfazed by economic data that pointed to a solid jobs market, which could lower expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The latest weekly initial claims data came in better than expected, and the odds of an interest rate cut coming in early April actually fell from the day before, to 30.2% from 34.6%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Nonetheless, the market is still pricing in two quarter-point cuts in 2026, which aligns with stock market investor expectations.\nThe sector performance continues to improve into the mid-session with eight sectors positive, up from seven earlier in the session. Technology is still number one with a 1.38% gain. Energy (-0.11%), which was the worst performer earlier today, has improved and been replaced by Health (-0.67%) as the weakest sector, suggesting crude oil may have found support and stabilized.\nASML Holding is one of the day\u2019s best performers with a more than 6% gain at the mid-session. Shares of the chip-equipment manufacturer rose after customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) announced larger-than-expected capital spending gains.\nTSM\u2019s earnings beat fueled a rally in memory chip stocks. SanDisk rose 8%, and Western Digital gained more than 6%, according to CNBC. Micron Technology is more than 2% higher, and Seagate Technology rose more than 4%.\nIn other technology-related news, Dell Technologies gained almost 3%. The PC and server company rose following an upgrade at Barclays to overweight from equal weight, CNBC wrote. \u201cThe firm cited the strength of Dell\u2019s AI server orders, stability of its AI operating markets and expanding opportunities in enterprise server and storage for the call.\u201d Nokia was upgraded to overweight by Morgan Stanley on AI-driven network demand.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) jumped above a key uptrend line at 23,579.10, reaching an intraday high at 23,721.11 and putting it in a position to challenge the January high at 23,813.30. This is the last barrier before the 24,019.99 all-time high. Look for a bullish tone into the close as long as the uptrend line holds as support.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Instead, they steadily rose month after month, turning once-semi-affordable communities into seven-figure spots, according to Zillow\u2019s Home Value Index.\nThe data suggest single-family homes across the outskirts of L.A. County are more valuable than you might think.\nHere are 12 of the newest million-dollar neighborhoods around L.A., in alphabetical order.\nAdams Hill (Glendale)\n2021 value: $983,515\n2025 value: $1.12 million\nOnce tied to the now-defunct city of Tropico, Adams Hill was annexed to Glendale in 1918. The hilly neighborhood is tucked on the southeast tip of the city near Glassell Park and Atwater Village and features a vibrant mix of 1920s bungalows and Spanish Colonial-style retreats. Smaller homes can be found in the $800,000 range, but anything with a view fetches well over $1 million. There are also plenty of buildable lots, if you\u2019re feeling ambitious.\nChatsworth\n2021 value: $925,501\n2025 value: $1.02 million\nOnce a hot spot for western film sets, Chatsworth now serves as a suburban retreat for those seeking space, with relatively low population density compared with other San Fernando Valley neighborhoods. There\u2019s a variety of price points here: new construction on the west side sells for millions, but manufactured homes on leased lots are listed for less than $200,000. The plethora of tract houses built from the \u201850s to the \u201870s go for around $1 million.\nEl Dorado South / El Dorado Park / Los Altos\n2021 value: $906,912\n2025 value: $1.04 million\nThe million-dollar typical home has made its way to the working and middle class flats of east Long Beach, where a trio of neighborhoods eclipsed the mark in 2023 and 2024. The three enclaves circle El Dorado Regional Park, the city\u2019s largest park, and feature classic California ranches that typically sell for $800,000 to $1.2 million.\nGranada Hills\n2021 value: $894,428\n2025 value: $1.02 million\nAnother suburban staple of the San Fernando Valley, Granada Hills became a million-dollar neighborhood in 2024. The deals are found on the south side, where four-and five-bedroom homes still list in the $900,000 range. The luxury properties are tucked on the north end, including the historic Balboa Highlands tract \u2014 a pristine collection of 108 Midcentury gems designed by Joseph Eichler. Those typically sell for $1.7 million or more.\nHistoric Quarter (Agoura Hills)\n2021 value: $974,384\n2025 value: $1.1 million\nMillion-dollar homes are nothing new for Agoura Hills, the slow-growth bedroom community between L.A. and Thousand Oaks, but the city\u2019s Historic Quarter section hit the mark in 2022. It\u2019s been tough to find a home for less than $1 million ever since"

S&P 500 futures similarly tacked on 0.15 per cent.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s lingering doubts about the spend around capex and AI more broadly, and I guess with the TSMC report yesterday being pretty solid and sounding optimistic, it certainly provided a much needed shot in the arm for those AI names which have been struggling on Wall Street in recent months,\u201d said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG.\nNavigate Asia in\na new global order\nGet the insights delivered to your inbox.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it galvanised or basically shot them higher, but it certainly provided some much needed reassurance there, that everything remains on track.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.42 per cent, weighed down in part by a recovery in the yen which has retreated from an 18-month low.\nEurostoxx 50 futures fell 0.38 per cent while FTSE futures eased 0.18 per cent, after European shares scaled a record high on Thursday.\nIn currencies, the dollar hovered near a six-week high, after a slew of upbeat US economic releases including data that showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week.\nThe euro languished near a 1-1/2-month low and bought US$1.1606, while sterling slipped 0.06 per cent to US$1.3376.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar stood at 99.36, not far from Thursday\u2019s top of 99.493, its highest since December 2.\n\u201cMounting evidence of stable labour conditions is lowering the odds of an April cut, as fixed income watchers grow increasingly confident that the next benchmark drop will come from Chair Powell\u2019s successor in June,\u201d said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nMarkets are now pricing in a 67 per cent chance that the Federal Reserve will stand pat on rates in April, up from 37 per cent a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Odds for a steady outcome in June have also risen to 37.5 per cent, compared to 17 per cent last month.\nThe yen was 0.1 per cent stronger at 158.48 per dollar, though it was not too far from an 18-month trough of 159.45 hit earlier in the week.\nThe currency has been sold off on the prospect of a snap election in Japan as early as next month, which investors bet could pave the way for expanded fiscal stimulus from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\u201cFor Takaichi, the snap poll offers the chance of a stronger mandate at home and abroad - but failure would likely spell a swift end to her premiership,\u201d said Daniel Hurley, portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price.\nIn the oil market, prices were recovering from their steep fall in the previous session after Trump\u2019s watered-down comments on Iran allayed concerns over potential military action against Tehran and oil supply disruptions.\nBrent futures were up 0.11 per cent at US$63.83 a barrel, having tumbled more than 4 per cent in the previous session. US crude was similarly up 0.2 per cent at US$59.31 per barrel, after a 4.6 per cent fall on Thursday.\nSpo"
