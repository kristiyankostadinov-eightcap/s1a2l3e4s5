Markets currently expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged at its next meeting on March 18.\nGold, which does not provide interest income, typically benefits in a lower interest-rate environment.\nOn geopolitics, reports said Iran is pressing ahead with nuclear deal talks with the United States, which could bring economic benefits to both sides."

At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading near $4,987, after marking an intraday high around $5,054, down roughly 0.90% on the day.\nInflation cools, labour market firms as traders price gradual easing\nA modest uptick in the US Dollar (USD) is weighing on Bullion. Meanwhile, last week\u2019s US economic releases trimmed expectations for an imminent Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut, further capping upside attempts in Gold. That said, expectations for monetary policy easing in the second half of the year continue to offer underlying support to the non-yielding metal.\nUS Consumer Price Index (CPI) data came in softer than expected. Headline CPI rose 0.2% MoM in January, slowing from 0.3% in December. On an annual basis, inflation eased to 2.4% YoY from 2.7%.\nMeanwhile, the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) increased by 130K, well above December\u2019s revised 48K gain, while the Unemployment Rate edged down to 4.3% from 4.4%.\nTaken together, the latest labour market and inflation data suggest the Fed\u2019s dual mandate is moving in the right direction, with labour conditions stabilising and price pressure gradually moderating.\nAs a result, traders have increased their bets on more than 50 basis points (bps) of easing this year, with interest rate futures pricing in the first cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nElsewhere, persistent geopolitical tensions continue to underpin safe-haven demand for Gold, as US-Iran developments remain in focus. The BBC reported on Monday that Iran is willing to consider compromises to reach a nuclear agreement, provided Washington is open to discussing sanctions relief.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Geneva for a high-stakes second round of nuclear talks, with negotiations set to resume on Tuesday.\nAgainst this backdrop, Gold could remain range-bound in the near term, with heightened volatility across the precious metals space discouraging aggressive positioning. Thin liquidity trading conditions due to the US Presidents\u2019 Day holiday are also likely to keep price action choppy on Monday.\nLooking ahead this week, attention will turn to Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) January meeting.\nFocus will then shift to Friday\u2019s US Personal Income and Spending report, which will include the latest reading on core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\nMarkets will also assess the advance estimate of fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for further clues on the timing of the next rate cut.\nTechnical analysis: Bullish structure intact, $5,100 breakout needed for trend continuation\nFrom a technical perspective, the daily chart shows an ascending triangle formation, with the $5,050-$5,100 region capping recovery attempts. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) remains above the 100-day SMA, reinforcing the broader bullish structure.\nBoth moving averages are sloping upward, while the price continues to trade comfortably above them, suggesting buyers retain control.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.94, hovering in neutral territory with a slight positive bias. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) remains elevated but has eased to 192.20, pointing to moderating volatility following recent sharp swings.\nOn the upside, a sustained break above $5,100 would confirm a bullish breakout from the ascending triangle and signal c"

The white metal has been slightly under pressure as dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations remain capped despite cooling United States (US) inflation in January.\nTheoretically, immaterial dovish Fed prospects in the near-term weigh on non-yielding assets, such as Silver.\nThe data showed on Friday that the US headline inflation dropped to 2.4% Year-on-Year (YoY) from 2.7% in December. In the same period, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2013 which excludes volatile food and energy items \u2013 grew moderately by 2.5%, as expected, against the previous reading of 2.6%.\nMeanwhile, investors brace for high volatility in the North American session as US markets will open after an extended weekend.\nThis week, the major trigger for the Silver price will be the release of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes of the January policy meeting on Wednesday. In the meeting, the Federal Reserve (Fed) left interest rates unchanged in the range of 3.50%-3.75%.\nGlobally, investors will pay attention to the second round of talks between the US and Iran in Geneva during the day. Delegates from both nations are expected to discuss the nuclear programme in Tehran. Ahead of talks, US President Donald Trump has signaled that Iran will make a deal, while warning that the nation will face consequences if they don\u2019t resolve issues.\nSilver technical analysis\nIn the daily chart, XAG/USD trades at $75.98. The 20-day exponential moving average descends to $83.52, signaling a weakening short-term structure. Price holds below this gauge, keeping rebounds capped and leaving sellers in control. RSI(14) at 43.67 (neutral) stays under the midline, indicating momentum favors the downside without oversold conditions.\nA daily close back above the falling 20-day EMA would ease immediate pressure and improve the near-term tone. Absent that, the path of least resistance remains lower, with failed bounces prone to being faded as the average continues to cap recovery attempts.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly "

Prices rose 0.2% during the month, below expectations of 0.3%, reflecting a 2.4% annual increase.\nThe US central bank tracks the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index for its 2% inflation target, and both measures remain well above that level.\nRecent data showed that job growth accelerated in January, while the unemployment rate in the US fell to 4.3% from 4.4% in December.\nThe Fed last month left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 3.50%\u20133.75% range.\nMarkets are pricing in the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady in March before delivering two 25-basis-point cuts later this year.\nSilver prices, which also fell sharply in the previous session, staged a strong comeback, with the March silver futures contract on Comex rising $3.6 to the day's high of $79.26 per troy ounce.\nThe white metal has gained 2.22% so far this week and is on track to end a two-week decline.\nPonmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that Comex Silver is trading near the $73\u2013$84 zone after a sharp correction from record highs above $121. He said strong buying interest is visible in the $65\u2013$70 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and long-term trend support.\nHe noted a sustained hold above this base, followed by a recovery and close above $85\u2013$92, could revive upside momentum toward $95\u2013$105 and potentially retest previous highs.\nThe medium- to long-term outlook remains constructive, supported by steady industrial demand and structural supply constraints, despite elevated volatility.\nOn Comex Gold, Ponmudi said it is trading near the $4,850\u2013$5,100 zone after a sharp correction from recent highs above $5,500\u2013$5,600. The broader uptrend remains intact, with the recent pullback reflecting profit booking and healthy price digestion.\nHe noted that prices are currently consolidating in the short term near current levels, continuing to trade above key moving averages, suggesting the correction is maturing.\n\"Strong buying interest is visible in the $4,500\u2013$4,700 support band, and sustained stability above this zone could set the stage for renewed upside momentum.

                "body": "For decades, oil prices could swing wildly on even the distant prospect of war in the Middle East. With U.S. shale, that changed, leading many to assume that anything short of an oil blockade in the Strait of Hormuz will leave oil markets cold-and such a blockade is highly unlikely. This, however, is a false sense of security. Geopolitics can still flip the script on oil bears.\nThe most recent oil price rally was prompted by the threat of a military escalation between the United States and Iran. Interestingly, the oil blockade that the United States imposed on Venezuela earlier this year failed to really move benchmarks in any consistent way. A war with Iran, on the other hand, has pushed Brent crude past $67 per barrel and WTI to over $62.\nRystad Energy recently published five possible scenarios about U.S.-Iranian relations, with the best-case one involving productive talks leading to a new nuclear deal that the U.S. would force on Tehran, per the consultancy, and that would lead to an increase in Iran's oil production. This is obviously a bearish scenario - but the other four are increasingly bullish. They range from limited U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and possibly oil infrastructure to wide-ranging strikes, the death of the country's Supreme Leader, and civil unrest ensuing after the collapse of the government.\nInterestingly, Rystad Energy does not see a huge price increase potential for crude oil in any of its scenarios. In the worst-case ones, the consultancy sees oil jumping by $10 to $15 per barrel as Iran's production suffers from the aftermath of adverse events. Some, however, note that if the war spreads across the Middle East, prices could top $100.\nA Bloomberg article looked at such a scenario recently, with the authors noting that the price shock would be the result of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, albeit for a brief period. Even though brief, such a disruption would affect 20% of global oil supply, the authors noted, leading to a potential price jump of as much as 80%, based on historical data. Still, the effect on oil prices from this worst-case scenario would be limited-because the world, at least according to the authors, does not need as much oil as it did decades ago.\nThe reason for this is energy efficiency, with the authors pointing out that \"In the US, the amount of oil needed to produce one unit of GDP has fallen by about a quarter since 2011.\" However, on a global scale, crude oil remains the top primary energy source, which means a price shock would cause pain-although not as much pain as it might have caused 20 years ago, for instance, thanks to inflation. \"Inflation means $100 oil today buys fewer goods and services than $100 oil a decade or two ago,\" Dina Esfandiary and Ziad Daoud wrote. This is hardly any consolation for those who, with Brent at over $100, would be able to afford even fewer goods and services.\nHowever, such a major disruption is the least likely scenario for the U.S.-Iranian conflict. Just this weekend, Reuters reported that Iran wanted to make a deal with the U.S., citing a senior Tehran official as suggesting the Iranian side was willing to make concessions in order to strike a deal and get sanctions lifted.\nNeedless to say, that would be highly bearish for oil prices because it would likely lead to an expansion in Iran's oil production. But in case the two fail to agree on a deal, the potential for escalation remains active-and the prospect of a deal is also distant, despite this latest signal from Tehran. Indeed, last week saw oil prices make gains on reports that the U.S. was building a substantial military presence in the Persian Gulf, signaling it was prepared for an extended conflict with Iran-and that extended conflict significantly raises the risk of oil infrastructure getting targeted and disrupting Iran's production of crude, currently at some 3.2 million barrels daily. The extended conflict scenario also increases the risk of other Middle Eastern oi"

                "body": "It\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of the fracking boom. But it is ending.\nThe four big US basins are drying up. Decline is baked in. Last December may have been a peak for US shale oil. Gas may have peaked back in 2024.\nRather a lot of billion-dollar companies are looking for some new basins to sink their drills into. If they can\u2019t find any, they\u2019ll fade away.\nEligible basins do exist in a lot of countries around the world. Including in Australia. But not many governments accept the fracking that makes oil and gas extraction hugely profitable.\nBut that\u2019s changing. With the Americans proving fracking\u2019s potential, a few countries that banned fracking are now on the cusp of electing governments that are openly pro-fracking. Places like the UK and several countries in Eastern Europe.\nSome countries home to proven gas reserves have already triggered their own booms. Billions are already being invested as you read this. Argentina tops that list. Oil and gas majors are hoping to get first dibs on a re-run of the US shale story, which they came late to.\nIt all amounts to a huge boom in gas supply that\u2019ll be competing with Aussie gas exporters. Countries that we sell to could unlock their home-grown energy reserves. Some could even become gas exporters.\nBut is it a risk or an opportunity?\nHow the shale and fracking\nrevolution reshaped America\nAmerica knew about its four key basins of oil and gas for many years. But much of the shale oil and gas hadn\u2019t been economically recoverable.\nFracking turned a large chunk of those resources into reserves. Meaning they became economically viable to extract. It also made existing wells dramatically more profitable by increasing their production.\nThe boom was on. Fracking turned marginal shale oil and gas into a $1.4 trillion sector.\nAt least eight companies I could find became ten-baggers thanks to fracking. Meaning their shares went up more than 1000%.\nFracking and the US shale boom it unleashed became one of the most economically and geopolitically important developments of the last 50 years. The combination reshaped the US economy, global oil and gas markets and redefined geopolitics.\nFracking turned the US from a major energy importer into the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. The US also became the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG.\nThe shift helped reign in the US trade balance and propped up the petrodollar link between energy and US dollar trade by adding more seaborn oil and gas to global trade.\nIt smashed the OPEC cartel\u2019s control over oil markets and thereby geopolitics.\nIt allowed the US to dodge Europe\u2019s deindustrialisation by keeping energy prices in the US far lower.\nIt turned the world\u2019s energy chokepoints into minor inconveniences by creating alternative supply routes that could adjust for supply disruption.\nIt fuelled the US AI data centre boom while most of the rest of the world missed out.\nIt pushed US GDP growth far ahead of other developed economies.\nIt provided cheaper energy for US consumers at a cost saving of $800 billion per year, about 3% of US GDP.\nAdvertisement:\nBestselling author and tech investor James Altucher says:\n\u2018Forget Tesla. Forget PayPal. Forget X (formerly Twitter).\nThere\u2019s a good chance this will be bigger than all of Elon\u2019s companies put together.\nAnd it could be going public in 2026.\u2019\nClick to see James\u2019s strategy\nfor getting positioned early (don\u2019t wait)\nIn the state of Pennsylvania alone, the natural gas industry alone generated over $5.8 billion in local, state, and federal tax revenues in 2022.\nBut shale\u2019s importance goes well beyond that. Without it, Europe\u2019s energy crisis of 2022 would have been catastrophic\u2026\nFracking saved Europe once already\nWhen Europe decided to starve itself of Russian energy, America filled the void. The continent now gets a quarter of its gas from the US. And that\u2019s on track to become half by 2030.\nIronically enough, Russia\u2019s attempt to seize eastern Ukraine has been replaced by the US\u2019 attempt to seize Greenland. "

The broader fundamental backdrop, however, warrants some caution for bearish traders before positioning for deeper losses.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, preserves the overnight modest gains and holds steady above the 97.00 mark, which, in turn, exerts some downward pressure on the EUR/USD pair. The shared currency, on the other hand, is undermined by a gradual shift toward the possibility of a rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB), bolstered by a fall in the Eurozone inflation to the lowest level since September 2024.\nThe upside for the USD, however, is more likely to remain capped on the back of dovish US Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, traders ramped up bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in June following the release of softer US consumer inflation figures last Friday. This comes amid concerns about the Fed's independence, which might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and help limit the downside for the EUR/USD pair.\nAdding to this, the underlying bullish sentiment might cap the safe-haven buck. Traders might also opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path before placing fresh directional bets. Hence, the focus will remain glued to the FOMC minutes on Wednesday. Apart from this, the Advance US Q4 GDP report, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, and the global flash PMIs would provide a fresh impetus during the latter part of the week.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week.

                "body": "The currency pair had a bit of a mixed showing last week, with the early Monday move seeing price climb back above 1.1900 before stalling closer to 1.1920. After that, the hotter-than-expected US jobs report here sent the pair back down below the figure level. And since then, the pair has been meandering just under 1.1900 but with not enough momentum to break towards 1.1800.\nSo, what's next for EUR/USD?\nThe technical story shows that the pair is consolidating a little as we get into the new week. That as price action rests in between both the 100 (red line) and 200-hour (blue line) moving averages. That suggests the near-term bias is more neutral for now. The latter is the bigger key technical level as it provides a floor for price action since last week already.\nThe key level is seen at 1.1853 currently, keeping close to a large set of option expiries for the pair today. As such, that should reinforce a floor of sorts for price action in trading today. That considering a lack of major catalysts on the day and with it being a US holiday.\nAs such, the next key move this week will have to come on a break on either side of the key near-term levels highlighted. Push back above the 100-hour moving average, and the near-term bias turns more bullish. Fall below the 200-hour moving average, and the near-term bias switches to being more bearish instead. The latter will open the door towards the 1.1800 mark next.\nIn terms of fundamental factors, the euro side of the equation seems to be more limited. I'm saying that in the sense that everything that we know is already factored into the euro currency already.\nThe ECB remains on the sidelines with markets not really expecting anything from euro area data in the short-term to change that outlook. Meanwhile, EUR/USD closer to the 1.20 level will keep ECB policymakers on guard and that will also see long positions be more wary.\nAs such, it's more of the dollar side of the equation that will do the work in the week ahead. On the data docket, there is the FOMC meeting minutes, US Q4 GDP, PCE price data, and PMI data to work through. But besides that, there are also two other key risk events worth noting here.\nAll the while as markets are continuing to size up the dollar and its vulnerabilities, amid a sluggish start to the new year in general. That especially since traders are sticking with the de-dollarisation narrative and currency debasement narrative for the most part.\nING is of the view that while the pair may be \"overvalued\" by their estimates, a softer dollar will continue to keep it underpinned for the time being.\n\"The short-term fair value of EUR/USD has dropped to 1.165 after the latest hawkish repricing in the USD curve, meaning the overvaluation gap has now widened too. In line with our USD view, we are reluctant to see that gap being filled entirely, even if some downside risks for the pair remain.\""

                "body": "When is the UK employment data and how could it affect GBP/USD?\nThe United Kingdom (UK) labor market data for the three months ending December is scheduled to be published today at 07:00 GMT.\nAccording to estimates, the ILO Unemployment Rate remained steady at 5.1%, the highest level seen since quarter-ending January 2024. This would be the third straight time when the UK jobless rate is seen at 5.1%. Claimant Count Change is expected to have increased by 22.8K in January from 17.9K in December.\nInvestors will pay close attention to the UK labor market data to get fresh cues on the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy outlook.\nIn the employment report, investors will also focus on Average Earnings Excluding Bonuses, a key measure of wage growth, which is expected to have risen at an annualized rate of 4.2%, slower than 4.5% in the three months ending in November. Average Earnings Including Bonuses is also estimated to have grown moderately. The wage growth measure is seen as lower at 4.6% against the previous release of 4.7%.\nSigns of slowing wage growth and weak employment demand would prompt expectations of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) in the near term, at times when policymakers are confident that price pressures would return to the 2% target in the second quarter this year.\nHow could UK employment data affect the GBP/USD\nGBP/USD trades 0.16% lower to near 1.3610 at the press time. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) slips to 1.3631 and caps rebounds as price holds below the gauge.\nThe 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 (below the midline) underscores waning momentum.\nBroadly, the pair demonstrates a sharp volatility contraction amid a Symmetrical Triangle formation. The upside remains capped near the downward-sloping border at 1.3675, while the downside remains supported near the advancing border at 1.3600.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nEconomic Indicator\nILO Unemployment Rate (3M)\nThe ILO Unemployment Rate released by the UK Office for National Statistics is the number of unemployed workers divided by the total civilian labor force. It is a leading indicator for the UK Economy. If the rate goes up, it indicates a lack of expansion within the UK labor market. As a result, a rise leads to a weakening of the UK economy. Generally, a decrease of the figure is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while an increase is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Feb 17, 2026 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 5.1%\nPrevious: 5.1%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Unemployment Rate is the broadest indicator of Britain\u2019s labor market. The figure is highlighted by the broad media, beyond the financial sector, giving the publication a more significant impact despite its late publication. It is released around six weeks after the month ends. While the Bank of England is tasked with maintaining price stability, there is a substantial inverse correlation between unemployment and inflation. A higher than expected figure tends to be GBP-bearish.\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

                "body": "GBP/USD has surrendered Friday\u2019s strong rebound at the start of the new week, drifting back toward the 1.3630 region as traders refocus on domestic UK risks and the upcoming labour market report. The data release on Tuesday is expected to be pivotal for near-term Pound direction and could define Cable\u2019s next move.\nSterling remains pressured by the increasingly dovish stance of the Bank of England. Although policymakers left rates unchanged at the February meeting, the unexpected 5-4 Monetary Policy Committee split signaled a stronger bias toward easing. Governor Andrew Bailey reinforced this view, stating inflation could return to target sooner than previously projected. Markets have since priced roughly 50 basis points of rate cuts this year, capping GBP upside and limiting GBP/USD recovery attempts above 1.3700.\nPolitical uncertainty is adding another layer of pressure. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces renewed scrutiny after senior aide Morgan McSweeney resigned amid controversy surrounding the US ambassador appointment. Calls for Starmer\u2019s resignation from within the Labour Party have unsettled investors, who worry that leadership instability could weaken fiscal discipline. While senior ministers\u2019 public support has eased immediate fears, sentiment toward Sterling remains fragile.\nOn the US side, the Dollar stays broadly soft. The US Dollar Index hovers near a one-week low as markets maintain expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver two rate cuts later this year. Additional pressure comes from concerns over the Fed\u2019s independence and a risk-on global backdrop linked to easing Middle East tensions, reducing safe-haven demand for the Greenback.\nNear term, attention centers on Tuesday\u2019s UK employment figures and US Retail Sales later in the day. However, traders remain primarily focused on Wednesday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls and Friday\u2019s US CPI, which will shape expectations for the Fed\u2019s policy path and, by extension, GBP/USD direction.\nTrade idea:\nSell GBP/USD rallies toward 1.3700\u20131.3720, targeting 1.3550 and 1.3480; stop above 1.3770. Dovish BoE pricing and political risk keep rallies limited."

The Aussie pair is slightly under pressure as the Australian Dollar (AUD) drops after the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes, which lacked evidence of further interest rate hikes in the near term.\nEarlier in the day, the RBA minutes of the February meeting showed that the rate hike was necessary to control inflation from rising further. \u201cMembers agreed inflation would likely stay above target too long without a policy response,\u201d RBA minutes showed. Officials didn\u2019t state any defined rate path and signaled that future decisions will be \u201cdata-dependent\u201d.\nGoing forward, investors will focus on the Australian employment data for January, which will be published on Thursday. The employment data will influence market expectations for the RBA\u2019s monetary policy outlook.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) trades broadly calm ahead of the opening of the United States (US) markets after an extended weekend. This week, major triggers for the US Dollar will be the release of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes and the flash Q4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data.\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nAUD/USD trades lower at around 0.7060 as of writing. Price holds above the rising 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6989, reinforcing a bullish bias. The 20-day EMA slopes higher, reflecting sustained upward momentum.\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63 (bullish) has eased from recent extremes, indicating momentum remains positive without being stretched. The rising trend line from 0.6668 underpins the advance, with support aligning near 0.7021.\nMaintaining traction above that trend support would keep buyers in control and leave scope for further gains. A daily close below the 20-day EMA at 0.6989 would soften the structure and open room for a deeper pullback. RSI holding above 50 confirms the positive bias; a sustained downturn through the midline would warn of fading momentum. If 0.7021 holds, dips could be shallow, while a loss of that area would shift risk to the downside.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nRBA FAQs\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Australia. Decisions are made by a board of governors at 11 meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings as required. The RBA\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means an inflation rate of 2-3%, but also \u201c..to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\u201d Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will strengthen the Australian Dollar (AUD) and vice versa. Other RBA tools include quantitative easing and tightening.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for currencies since it lowers the value of money in general, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Moderately higher inflation now tends to lead central banks to put up their interest rates, which in turn has the effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in the case of Australia is the Aussie Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data gauges the health of an economy and can have an impact on the value of its currency. Investors prefer to invest their capital in economies that are safe and growing rather than precarious and shrinking. Greater capital inflows"

                "body": "AUD/USD is steady after RBA minutes reinforced tightening bias, though policymakers emphasized low confidence in outlining the next move. That cautious messaging capped immediate upside follow-through. Still, markets continue to price a solid chance of a May rate hike, despite growing talk that the currency\u2019s recent surge could lessen the need for further tightening. As long as those expectations remain intact, any pullback in AUD/USD should be contained, leaving the broader uptrend undisturbed.\nIn recent days, arguments have surfaced that Aussie\u2019s recent surge may act as a \u201cshadow hike,\u201d reducing need for additional tightening. Since early January, AUD has rallied roughly 5.8% against Dollar and 4.8% against Yuan. A stronger exchange rate lowers import prices, theoretically easing inflation pressure without further rate increases.\nGiven that China accounts for roughly 25\u201330% of Australia\u2019s total trade and US around 11% of goods imports, the appreciation looks meaningful. Standard models suggest that a sustained 10% appreciation trims headline inflation by about 0.5\u20131.0% over a year.\nHowever, relying on currency strength alone to anchor inflation is a risky strategy. The recent 5% move is helpful but limited, and its impact is concentrated in goods prices. Yet goods inflation is no longer the primary problem. December CPI showed headline at 3.8%, driven by domestic pressures. Rent inflation persists amid structural housing constraints. Services costs remain elevated due to wage dynamics. In short, exchange-rate strength does little to address core domestic drivers.\nThe logic for further tightening rests on three pillars a stronger AUD cannot directly weaken. First, labor market remains tight, and wage growth continues to support services inflation. Second, productivity gains remain modest. Without stronger output per worker, higher wages feed directly into higher prices. Third, fiscal policy still provides tailwinds, offsetting some monetary restraint.\nMarket pricing continues to assign high probability to another 25bps hike in May, pending Q1 CPI confirmation. Unless data show abrupt cooling in labor market or services pricing, the \u201cshadow hike\u201d narrative is unlikely to displace tightening bias.\nTechnically, some more consolidations would likely be seen in AUD/USD below 0.7146 short term top. But downside should be contained above 0.6896 support to bring up trend resumption. The real test lies in 0.72 zone, with 100% projection of 0.5913 to 0.6706 from 0.6420 at 0.7213. Decisive break there will pave the way to 138.2% projection at 0.7516. But that break through 0.72 might need either a shift in expectations for more than one RBA hike this year, or more Fed rate cuts."

Market participants globally now focus intently on the AUD/USD currency pair, which currently exhibits remarkable stability despite underlying economic tensions. This temporary calm precedes potentially significant volatility, as traders await crucial insights from Australia\u2019s central bank.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis and Current Market Position\nTechnical charts reveal the AUD/USD pair consolidating within a tight 30-pip range throughout the Asian and early European sessions. Consequently, this consolidation pattern suggests market indecision ahead of the RBA minutes release. The pair currently tests a critical support zone around 0.6550, a level that has provided both resistance and support multiple times throughout 2024. Meanwhile, immediate resistance sits firmly at 0.6580, creating a well-defined trading channel.\nMarket analysts observe several key technical indicators converging at current levels. Specifically, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have formed a bearish crossover pattern, typically signaling potential downward momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 45, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This technical neutrality reflects the market\u2019s balanced assessment of competing fundamental forces.\nChart Patterns and Historical Context\nHistorical data from the past decade reveals interesting patterns for the AUD/USD pair during similar periods of monetary policy uncertainty. For instance, during the 2018-2019 trade war tensions, the pair exhibited similar consolidation before breaking sharply following RBA communications. Current price action mirrors those historical precedents, suggesting traders anticipate directional clarity from the central bank\u2019s minutes.\nUS Dollar Strength: Drivers and Global Implications\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) continues its impressive rally, reaching three-month highs against a basket of major currencies. This sustained strength stems from multiple interconnected factors. First, recent Federal Reserve communications suggest a more hawkish stance than markets previously anticipated. Second, robust US economic data, particularly strong employment figures and resilient consumer spending, support the case for maintaining higher interest rates.\nGlobal capital flows significantly contribute to USD strength. Investors increasingly seek dollar-denominated assets as safe havens amid geopolitical uncertainties in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Additionally, higher US Treasury yields compared to other developed markets attract foreign investment, further boosting dollar demand. This creates a challenging environment for commodity currencies like the Australian dollar, which typically underperform during periods of broad USD strength.\nAnticipating RBA Minutes: What Markets Seek\nFinancial markets globally await the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s February meeting minutes with heightened interest. These documents typically provide detailed insights into the central bank\u2019s policy deliberations. Specifically, traders will scrutinize several key aspects. First, the board\u2019s assessment of current inflation trends remains paramount. Second, discussions surrounding labor market conditions will receive close attention. Third, any mention of currency valuation concerns could signal future policy directions.\nPrevious RBA communications have emphasized data-dependent decision-making. Therefore, the minutes may reveal the specific economic thresholds that would trigger policy adj"

                "body": "Japanese Yen edges higher vs. USD on BoJ-Fed policy divergence; lacks bullish conviction\n- USD/JPY meets with a fresh supply on Tuesday and stalls the previous day\u2019s positive move.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed expectations offer some support to the JPY amid intervention fears.\n- The USD struggles to lure buyers and contributes to the pair\u2019s slide during the Asian session.\nThe USD/JPY pair struggles to capitalize on the previous day's positive move and attracts some intraday sellers near the 153.75 resistance zone during the Asian session on Tuesday. Spot prices touch a fresh daily low around the 153.25-153.20 area in the last hour, though the downtick lacks bearish conviction.\nTraders remain on high alert amid the possibility of a coordinated Japan-US intervention to stem weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY). Moreover, the diverging interest rate paths between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) contribute to capping the upside for the USD/JPY pair. However, Monday's disappointing release of Japan's Q4 GDP might have reduced urgency for the BoJ to tighten further, which might hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets.\nAdding to this, the prevailing risk-on environment might keep a lid on the safe-haven JPY and act as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. That said, any meaningful appreciation for the currency pair still seems elusive as dovish Fed expectations, along with threats to the central bank's independence, fail to assist the US Dollar (USD) in attracting any meaningful buyers. Traders might also opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path before positioning for the next leg of a directional move.\nHence, the focus will remain glued to the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday. This week's US economic docket also features Durable Goods Orders and housing market data. Apart from this, the global flash PMIs and speeches from influential FOMC members could provide some meaningful impetus to the USD/JPY pair during the latter part of the week. Nevertheless, the broader fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years"

                "body": "USD/JPY: Dollar Pops Above \u00a5153 After Japan\u2019s Economy Barely Avoids Recession Dive\n1 min read\nKey points:\n- Japanese yen sells off\n- Markets digest Japan\u2019s GDP\n- Next rate hike coming in spring?\nJapan\u2019s GDP grew just 0.1% in the fourth quarter, reversing a 0.7% drop from the previous three months of 2025.\n\u26a0\ufe0f GDP Barely in the Green\n- The yen weakened early Monday, sending the USD/JPY above \u00a5153 with a session high near \u00a5153.30. The move followed Japan\u2019s fourth-quarter GDP print, which showed growth of just 0.1% after a 0.7% contraction in Q3.\n- That slim expansion helped Japan dodge a technical recession, commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output. Economists had expected a stronger 0.4% rebound, so relief came with a side of disappointment.\n- On an annualized basis, growth clocked in at 0.2%, far below the 1.6% forecast and only a modest recovery from the previous quarter\u2019s 2.3% decline. Stabilization, yes. Momentum, not quite.\n\ud83d\udca1 What It Means for the BOJ\n- The Bank of Japan recently nudged up its growth outlook for fiscal 2026 to 0.9% and sees moderate expansion supported by government stimulus and easy financial conditions. Translation: policy remains supportive for now.\n- Inflation cooled to 2.1% in January, its lowest since March 2022, though it has stayed above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target for 45 straight months. That keeps the door open for gradual normalization.\n- Analysts still pencil in a spring rate hike. A rate hike strengthens a currency in theory because higher yields attract capital. Today\u2019s soft GDP print complicates that path.\n\ud83d\udcaa Why the Dollar Is in Charge\n- The dollar-yen often moves on yield differentials, the gap between US and Japanese interest rates. With US rates still elevated and Japan moving cautiously, that gap favors the dollar.\n- The modest GDP rebound reinforces the idea that the BOJ will move slowly, keeping Japanese yields contained and limiting support for the yen in the near term.\n- As long as US economic data holds up and Japan\u2019s recovery looks fragile, rallies in the dollar-yen toward the mid-150s remain on traders\u2019 radar, with intervention chatter lurking in the background."

Spot prices currently trade just below mid-1.3600s, though bulls seem hesitant and opt to wait for the release of the latest consumer inflation figures from Canada.\nThe headline Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to remain above the Bank of Canada's (BoC) target and hold steady at 2.4% YoY in January. The crucial data will influence expectations about the central bank's policy outlook, which, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the Canadian Dollar (CAD) and providing some impetus to the USD/CAD pair.\nIn the meantime, the BoC's neutral stance is largely offset by softer Crude Oil prices, which seem to undermine demand for the commodity-linked Loonie. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, preserves the previous day's modest gains and acts as a tailwind for the USD/CAD pair. The USD bulls, however, seem reluctant amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations.\nIn fact, traders ramped up their bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in June following the release of softer US consumer inflation figures last Friday. Furthermore, the current market pricing indicates the possibility of at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the Fed in 2026. This, along with threats to the Fed's independence, keeps a lid on the Greenback.\nAdding to this, the underlying bullish sentiment contributes to capping the upside for the safe-haven buck ahead of the FOMC minutes, due on Wednesday. Apart from this, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index on Friday would offer cues about the Fed's rate-cut path and drive the USD. This, in turn, warrants some caution for the USD/CAD bulls.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoC Consumer Price Index Core (YoY)\nThe BoC Consumer Price Index Core, released by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on a monthly basis, represents changes in prices for Canadian consumers by comparing the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services. It is considered a measure of underlying inflation as it excludes eight of the most-volatile components: fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation and tobacco products. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to the same month a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Canadian Dollar (CAD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Feb 17, 2026 13:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 2.8%\nSource: Statistics Canada\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

At the time of writing, the pair is trading around 1.3628.\nPrice action could remain choppy in thin liquidity conditions due to the US President\u2019s Day holiday and Canada\u2019s Family Day, with market focus shifting to Canada\u2019s January inflation data due on Tuesday.\nEconomists expect the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) to rise 0.1% in January, after contracting 0.2% in December. On an annual basis, headline CPI is forecast to hold steady at 2.4%, unchanged from the previous month. A firmer-than-expected print could strengthen the case for the Bank of Canada (BoC) to keep interest rates on hold for longer.\nAt its January meeting, the Bank of Canada said monetary policy remains focused on keeping inflation close to the 2% target. The Governing Council judged that the current policy rate \u201cremains appropriate,\u201d while warning that the Canadian economy continues to face headwinds from elevated trade uncertainty linked to US tariffs.\nMeanwhile, firm Oil prices are lending modest support to the Loonie, given Canada\u2019s status as a major crude exporter. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading around $63.25, up nearly 1.0% on the day.\nIn the United States, near-term Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations have faded after last week\u2019s labor market data showed conditions stabilising. Nonfarm Payrolls rose by 130K, rebounding from 48K previously, while the Unemployment Rate eased to 4.3% from 4.4%.\nAt the same time, softer-than-expected inflation data has kept hopes alive for policy easing in the second half of the year, with traders still pricing in more than 50 basis points (bps) of rate cuts in 2026. Headline CPI rose 0.2% MoM in January, slowing from 0.3% in December. On an annual basis, inflation eased to 2.4% YoY from 2.7%.\nDiminishing expectations of Fed easing have helped stabilise the Greenback. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major peers, is hovering around the 97.00 mark, oscillating within a one-week trading range.\nHowever, structural headwinds such as US President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies, repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve, and rising government debt continue to weigh on sentiment, limiting any meaningful recovery in the US Dollar.\nAttention now turns to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes on Wednesday, followed by the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index and the advance estimate of fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Friday, for further clues on the timing of the next interest rate cut.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend"

                "body": "LONDON, April 2025 \u2013 The GBP/JPY currency pair demonstrates significant bullish momentum this week, decisively testing the crucial 209.60 resistance level as sustained Yen weakness reshapes forex market dynamics. Traders globally monitor this key technical threshold, which represents the highest point the pair has reached since November 2024. Consequently, market participants analyze fundamental drivers behind this movement, particularly shifting monetary policy expectations from the Bank of Japan and resilient UK economic indicators. This development follows three consecutive weeks of Sterling appreciation against the Japanese currency, marking one of 2025\u2019s most notable forex trends.\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis and Chart Patterns\nForex charts reveal compelling patterns for the British Pound against the Japanese Yen. The pair currently tests the 209.60 resistance level after breaking through several intermediate barriers. Specifically, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages now provide strong support around 207.80 and 206.40 respectively. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaches overbought territory at 68, suggesting potential consolidation before further advances. Additionally, trading volume has increased approximately 22% above the 30-day average during this ascent, confirming genuine buying interest rather than speculative positioning.\nSeveral technical indicators support the current bullish structure. First, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a strong positive momentum reading of +1.42. Second, Fibonacci retracement levels from the 2024 high of 211.80 to the January low of 198.60 indicate the 61.8% level at 209.20 aligns closely with current resistance. Third, Ichimoku Cloud analysis places price action firmly above the cloud, signaling a sustained uptrend. These technical factors collectively suggest the 209.60 level represents a critical battleground for directional momentum in coming sessions.\nKey Technical Levels for GBP/JPY\nFundamental Drivers Behind Yen Weakness\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s depreciation stems from multiple interconnected factors. Primarily, the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance despite global tightening cycles. Governor Kazuo Ueda recently reiterated the central bank\u2019s commitment to yield curve control, keeping 10-year Japanese Government Bond yields near 0%. Furthermore, Japan\u2019s inflation rate, while above the 2% target, shows signs of moderation according to March 2025 data. This combination reduces pressure for immediate policy normalization, consequently diminishing Yen appeal for yield-seeking investors.\nSeveral economic developments contribute to Yen softness. Japan\u2019s trade balance recorded a deficit of \u00a51.2 trillion in February, marking the fifteenth consecutive month of negative trade flows. Simultaneously, real wages declined 1.8% year-over-year, suppressing domestic consumption momentum. Moreover, geopolitical factors influence currency flows, with traditional safe-haven demand for the Yen diminishing amid stabilized global tensions. These fundamental elements create a challenging environment for Yen strength, particularly against currencies with hawkish central banks like the Bank of England.\n- Monetary Policy Divergence: BoJ maintains negative rates while global peers tighten\n- Trade Deficits: Persistent import costs weaken Yen fundamentals\n- Inflation Dynamics: Consumer price increases moderate, reducing policy urgency\n- Risk Sentiment: Improved global markets reduce safe-haven Yen demand\nBritish Pound Strength and Economic Context\nThe Sterling demonstrates remarkable resilience against major currencies in 2025. Recent UK economic data surprises positively, with Q1 GDP growth preliminary estimates at 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. Additionally, services PMI readings remain firmly in expansion territory at 53.6, indicating sustained economic activity. Most significantly, inflation persistence keeps Bank of England policy expectati"

                "body": "In a development that has captured the attention of global forex markets, the GBP/JPY currency pair has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering to trade near the 209.30 level. This movement comes despite the release of data confirming Japan\u2019s return to economic growth in the first quarter of 2025. The apparent contradiction between a strengthening domestic economy and a weakening currency presents a complex puzzle for analysts and traders worldwide.\nGBP/JPY Recovery Defies Conventional Economic Logic\nThe British Pound to Japanese Yen exchange rate\u2019s ascent to 209.30 marks a significant technical and psychological level for traders. Typically, positive domestic economic data, such as GDP growth, provides fundamental support for a nation\u2019s currency. However, the Japanese Yen has failed to capitalize on this favorable news. Market participants are now scrutinizing the underlying drivers of this divergence. Several interconnected factors are contributing to this unusual market behavior, creating a unique trading environment.\nFirstly, the structure of Japan\u2019s GDP recovery warrants close examination. Preliminary data indicates that growth returned after a technical recession, but the composition reveals continued reliance on external demand and a still-weak domestic consumption trajectory. Consequently, the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance. This policy divergence with other major central banks, particularly the Bank of England, creates a powerful carry trade dynamic that favors selling the Yen. Furthermore, global risk sentiment has improved, reducing demand for the Yen\u2019s traditional safe-haven properties.\nTechnical and Sentiment Analysis of the Currency Pair\nFrom a chartist perspective, the recovery towards 209.30 represents a critical test of resistance. A successful breach could open the path toward higher technical targets, while a rejection would signal continued range-bound trading. Market sentiment, as measured by positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), shows that speculative accounts had built significant short positions in GBP/JPY prior to this move, suggesting a short-covering rally may be amplifying the price action.\nDeep Dive: Japan\u2019s GDP Growth and Its Currency Impact\nJapan\u2019s Cabinet Office reported that the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product expanded at an annualized rate of 1.2% in Q1 2025, ending a sequence of two consecutive quarters of contraction. This return to growth, while positive, fell short of some economists\u2019 forecasts. A detailed breakdown of the GDP components provides crucial context for the Yen\u2019s muted response.\n- External Demand (Net Exports): Contributed approximately 0.8 percentage points to growth, highlighting the economy\u2019s dependence on global trade conditions.\n- Private Consumption: Remained sluggish, rising a mere 0.2%, indicating persistent consumer caution and weak wage growth momentum.\n- Business Investment: Showed modest improvement but lacked the vigor needed to signal a robust, self-sustaining recovery.\nThis growth profile reinforces the market\u2019s expectation that the Bank of Japan will proceed with extreme caution regarding any normalization of its negative interest rate policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda has repeatedly emphasized the need to see sustainable inflation driven by wage growth before altering course. Therefore, the GDP data, while positive, did not alter the fundamental monetary policy outlook that weighs on the Yen.\nThe British Pound\u2019s Role in the Equation\nConversely, the British Pound has found its own sources of strength. Recent inflation data in the United Kingdom has proven stickier than anticipated, prompting markets to scale back expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bank of England in 2025. This repricing of UK rate expectations has provided a solid fundamental pillar for Sterling. Additionally, relative political stability and improved economic forecasts for the UK have reduced the perce"

Ecosystem Dominance in Decentralized Finance\nWith $99.4 billion locked across DeFi protocols and 20+ million monthly active wallets, Ethereum processes transaction volumes exceeding trillions annually.\nThis self-reinforcing network effect attracts developers seeking maximum distribution, which increases utility, drawing more users and further entrenching dominance.\n2. Supply Scarcity Through Staking Mechanisms\nNearly one-third of all ETH now sits in staking contracts earning 4-6% yields, competing favorably with traditional bonds while offering appreciation potential.\nThe EIP-1559 burn mechanism permanently destroys fees during high-activity periods, creating deflationary pressure that complements staking\u2019s supply removal.\n3. Wall Street\u2019s Growing Appetite\nSpot ETFs have accumulated 3.77 million ETH since launching, with recent months showing consistent net inflows.\nCME derivatives now represent 72% of global ETH futures volume, signaling deep institutional engagement in price discovery beyond retail speculation.\n4. Infrastructure Upgrades Enhancing Scalability\nLate 2025\u2019s Fusaka upgrade extended data availability via PeerDAS while raising gas limits, paving the way for exponentially cheaper Layer-2 operations.\nAs transaction costs plummet and user experience improves, barriers preventing mainstream adoption steadily erode.\n5. Competitive and Regulatory Headwinds\nFaster blockchains like Solana challenge Ethereum\u2019s market share with lower costs and different technical philosophies.\nRegulatory frameworks remain uncertain globally, with restrictive policies potentially slowing growth or displacing activity to friendlier jurisdictions.\n2026 Price Scenarios: Expert Consensus\nStandard Chartered projects $7,500 by year-end 2025, with continued appreciation through 2026 as tokenization expands.\nArthur Hayes offers a more bullish $10,000-$20,000 \u201cbefore cycle completion,\u201d citing network momentum and favorable macro conditions.\nSynthesizing these views suggests $8,000-$10,000 represents a reasonable 2026 target under steady conditions, though breaking resistance at $4,000-$4,800 remains crucial.\nSuccess depends on sustained ETF inflows, smooth scaling implementation, expanding DeFi usage, and supportive interest rate environments.\nThe 2030 Question: Conservative to Optimistic Cases\nAnalyst models for 2030 span $10,000-$30,000, with base cases clustering around $15,000-$20,000.\nOne maj"

Ethereum, dominating DeFi, may break its ATH of $4,946 by June with $55 billion locked, while Cardano aims for $1.50 amid regulatory developments. A new Bitcoin presale, Bitcoin Hyper, has raised over $31 million, promising enhanced utility for Bitcoin.\nWhile prices starkly contrast with recent highs, global crypto adoption continues advancing quietly in the background.\nA mix of technical signals and ongoing developments suggests that XRP, Ethereum and Cardano could be posting fresh highs by summer.\nBelow is a breakdown of what the charts are signaling.\nXRP (XRP): Ripple\u2019s SWIFT Challenger Targets a $5 Move\nWith a market cap of $91 billion, XRP ($XRP) is the largest crypto for cross-border payments.\nRipple engineered the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to serve as a next-generation alternative to SWIFT, enabling faster settlement times and lower costs for banks and financial institutions.\nThe company has recently doubled down on its vision, underscoring XRPL\u2019s readiness for institutional payment rails and real-world asset tokenization, while reinforcing XRP\u2019s core role in powering the network.\nXRP has also drawn attention from major institutions. Both the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House have pointed to Ripple\u2019s potential in enhancing global payment infrastructure.\nAdditionally, U.S. regulators recently approved spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving institutional and retail investors regulated exposure to XRP.\nShould the market turn bullish, XRP could hit a new ATH by summer.\nEthereum (ETH): The Foundation of DeFi Could Challenge ATH Soon\nEthereum ($ETH) dominates decentralized finance and the broader Web3 ecosystem with a market capitalization of $238 billion.\nWith around $55 billion locked across its applications, Ethereum remains the most commercially active blockchain in the industry.\nIn a bullish scenario, ETH could breach the $5,000 resistance zone as early as June, exceeding its prior ATH of $4,946 set last August.\nLonger term, Ethereum\u2019s path toward five-figure valuations will largely depend on clearer U.S. regulatory guidance and favorable macroeconomic conditions. Both are critical for accelerating institutional adoption in areas such as stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization.\nFor now, ETH is trading below its 30-day moving average, with an oversold RSI near 30. For bulls, this zone could be the best chance to accumulate.\nCardano (ADA): An Academic Approach to Building the Next DeFi Powerhouse\nEthereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson launched Cardano ($ADA) in 2015, with the network going live two years later.\nCardano is built on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism grounded in peer-reviewed academic research, a philosophy that continues to distinguish it within the competitive Layer-1 landscape.\nWith a market cap of over $10 billion and TVL of roughly $134 million, ADA remains sizable but still has plenty of headroom before it can seriously challenge Solana as the leading \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\nDespite a general decline since Q4 2025, a large bullish falling wedge pattern that emerged toward the end of 2026 suggests the potential for a breakout. If confirmed, ADA could push through key resistance levels and climb toward $1.50 by the end of Q1.\nShould US lawmakers pass the CLARITY Act, Cardano may revisit its ATH of $3.09 sooner rather than later.\nNew Bitcoin Presale Brings Solana-Level Performance to BTC\nWhile these blue-chip networks are relatively safe plays in the volatile world of crypto, the biggest upside this cycle may lie in early-stage disruptors like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new project that has investors talking about potentially outsized gains when it lists.\nThis buzzy project aims to introduce Solana\u2019s speed and utility to Bitcoin through a ded"

                "body": "ETHUSD Today, February 17: MegaETH TVL Jumps, TGE Still Distant\nMegaETH TVL has climbed about 65% to roughly US$66.5 million after mainnet, pointing to early demand for high\u2011speed Ethereum Layer 2 apps. Transak\u2019s instant fiat onramp should cut funding steps, while the MEGA token TGE remains tied to unmet KPIs. For Australian investors tracking ETHUSD, this mix means improving infrastructure but limited token\u2011driven speculation. We break down what is driving activity, why the token timeline matters, and the practical moves Aussies can make today to assess risk and capture utility.\nDrivers behind the 65% rise in MegaETH TVL\nMegaETH markets itself as a real-time Ethereum Layer 2 capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second, which can draw latency\u2011sensitive apps and market makers. That performance pitch, plus fresh mainnet buzz, is helping lift MegaETH TVL as teams test throughput and fees. Coverage highlights the 100K TPS goal and instant settlement focus source, which supports early activity before a broader consumer push.\nPost\u2011launch inflows have pushed MegaETH TVL to about US$66.5 million, roughly 65% higher week on week. The rise reflects bridging and liquidity seeding, not a token\u2011led rally. Reporting notes the MEGA token TGE is still gated by KPIs, so speculative flows remain muted even as infrastructure gains traction source. That keeps attention on real usage and partner integrations over short\u2011term hype.\nTransak fiat onramp and the AU user impact\nTransak fiat onramp support means users can move from card or bank payment to assets on MegaETH in fewer steps. For Australians, this can reduce friction when testing apps that need quick deposits or frequent top\u2011ups. Lower time-to-fund helps developers gather user feedback faster and may support steady MegaETH TVL growth as everyday users try simple swaps and transfers on the network.\nBefore using a Transak fiat onramp, Australians should compare total fees, FX spreads, card or bank limits, and settlement times. Confirm wallet compatibility, bridge routes back to Ethereum, and any account verification needs. Keep tax records for ATO reporting when swapping or bridging. Start with small test amounts, then scale as reliability improves and app utility justifies deeper engagement.\nMEGA token TGE remains distant\nThe MEGA token TGE is linked to specific KPIs that remain unmet, so a listing is not imminent. That reduces momentum trading and keeps focus on utility, not emissions. For now, MegaETH TVL looks driven by builders and early users. Traders expecting rapid token unlocks may stay cautious, which can make flows steadier but also limit near\u2011term airdrop\u2011style activity.\nWithout a live token, we can prioritise app testing, cost analysis, and risk controls. Track transaction success, fees versus competitors, and bridge reliability. Use reputable wallets and diversify stablecoin exposure across venues. If experimenting, ring\u2011fence capital, set transfer limits, and document each step. Let fundamentals guide sizing until MEGA token TGE details and KPI progress are clearly communicated.\nImplications for ETH and DeFi positioning\nIf activity on high\u2011throughput L2s scales, some demand may shift from the base chain to Layer 2, with net effects depending on how settlement batches accrue on Ethereum. For holders of ETHUSD, durable throughput and app stickiness can support the broader Ethereum thesis. The key is sustained usage, not a one\u2011off spike tied to incentives.\nWatch MegaETH TVL momentum, daily transactions, failed\u2011tx rates, and average fees relative to peers. Track Transak funding success, including approval times and user feedback. Monitor app launches, audited contracts, bridge volumes, and any updates on MEGA token TGE criteria. Compare activity quality to other Ethereum Layer 2 networks to gauge whether growth is sticky or promotional.\nFinal Thoughts\nMegaETH\u2019s early traction is real: MegaETH TVL is up about 65% to roughly US$66.5 million, powered by a speed\u2011first design and ea"

That marked a new all-time high.\nHard capital moved on-chain as tokenized assets expanded across the network.\nMoreover, this growth reflected increasing institutional participation in Solana\u2019s settlement infrastructure.\nThe expansion of tokenized value highlighted rising confidence in on-chain financial rails. A $1.66B RWA base carried weight and signaled meaningful ecosystem depth.\nSolana spot and futures Taker Dominance remains elevated\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, Spot Taker CVD (90-day) stayed decisively buy-dominant all week. Aggressive buyers pressed the market consistently. There was no meaningful rotation into sell control.\nMeanwhile, Futures Taker CVD (90-day) mirrored that strength. Derivatives traders leaned long with conviction.\nWhen Spot and Futures aligned on the buy side, it reflected sustained demand across markets.\nTherefore, such synchronized buy pressure typically preceded price expansion. If this positioning persisted, price would likely follow from here rather than diverge for long.\nIs a structural shift underway?\nATH RWA value, combined with persistent buy dominance, painted a serious picture. Due to these developments, the narrative shifted from survival to expansion. Solana looked less speculative and more foundational.\nLooking ahead, if liquidity confirmed this pressure, expansion could follow violently.\nHowever, failure to convert demand into price strength would stall momentum. As we progress into 2026, the data suggests conviction.\nThe market now had to respond. Was this the start of something larger?\nFinal Summary\n- RWA growth and sustained Taker CVD buy dominance signaled strong underlying demand for Solana.\n- Continued Bitcoin strength could spill over and push SOL higher from the $80\u2013$90 range."

                "body": "Dubai, UAE , February 16, 2026\nCrypto markets are always driven by timing. While many investors focus only on crypto prices today, experienced participants look for projects that are still undervalued before broader attention arrives. As the market prepares for its next expansion cycle, identifying the next big crypto early can make a significant difference.\nAmong the coins drawing attention right now are Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are established names, MUTM is still in presale Phase 7 and is positioning itself for substantial upside, with projections targeting growth as the platform moves closer to full deployment.\nCardano (ADA) shows potential for a bullish move of around 30% from its current price of $0.27155. Technical charts indicate strong support near $0.26, providing a solid base for upward momentum. Growing adoption of Cardano's smart contract ecosystem and ongoing development of DeFi and NFT projects on its blockchain increase real-world utility, attracting both retail and institutional investors.\nAdditionally, network upgrades like Vasil Hard Fork improve transaction efficiency and scalability, enhancing long-term fundamentals. With renewed market interest and solid project fundamentals, ADA has a clear path to test resistance levels near $0.35, making it a compelling short-term bullish opportunity.\nSolana (SOL) shows strong potential for a 50% bullish move from its current price of $83. The network's high-speed, low-cost blockchain continues to attract developers, especially in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects, boosting real-world adoption. Technical analysis highlights solid support around $78, indicating a foundation for upward momentum.\nRecent ecosystem upgrades and growing validator participation improve scalability and security, strengthening investor confidence. If market sentiment turns positive, SOL could test resistance near $125, reflecting a 50% upside. With its robust infrastructure, expanding ecosystem, and increasing utility, Solana presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking high-growth crypto exposure.\nCardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are established crypto assets with strong ecosystems and developer activity, making them reliable accumulation plays. However, their growth is tied to broader market cycles, limiting exponential upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers early-stage, high-upside potential, complementing ADA and SOL for investors seeking asymmetric returns.\nMUTM is currently $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale, up from $0.01. With $20.52 million raised and nearly 18,980 holders, early participation shows strong interest. Its staggered pricing, rising around 20% each phase, rewards early buyers, creating a clear incentive to invest before future price increases.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently launched its V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet. This sandbox environment allows users to interact with real smart contract functionality in a secure setting before mainnet goes live.\nCore features currently available include:\nThis testnet launch reduces barriers for new users and builds confidence by allowing real interaction with the protocol's mechanics. As more users become familiar with the system ahead of mainnet, organic demand for MUTM is expected to strengthen making it a strong candidate for at least growth post launch.\nUpon full launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a second lending mechanism: Peer-to-Peer lending. In this model, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly without intermediaries. Increased protocol usage will generate more fees, which directly supports the ecosystem's long-term economic cycle.\nSecondly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a stablecoin designed to maintain a value close to $1. This stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against crypto collateral such as ETH. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be removed from circulation.\nOnly approved issuers"

(AP News)\nFriday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average inch up by 48.95 points, a 0.1% gain to close at 49,500.93. The Nasdaq slipped, with traders eyeing new warnings about artificial intelligence reshaping segments of the tech sector. \u201cIt is a bit of good news as we head into the long holiday weekend,\u201d Orion\u2019s chief investment officer Tim Holland said.

This notable pre-market surge directly correlates with growing market conviction that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts in the coming months. Consequently, the improved risk appetite is driving capital toward equity markets, with futures contracts for the blue-chip index leading the charge.\nDow Jones Futures Rally on Monetary Policy Shift\nEarly trading data showed Dow Jones futures climbing by over 1.5%, a substantial move that often sets the tone for the regular session. This upward momentum follows a series of economic data releases and commentary from Federal Reserve officials that softened the hawkish stance prevalent for much of 2024. Market participants are now actively pricing in a higher probability of monetary easing. The CME FedWatch Tool, a key benchmark for rate expectations, recently indicated a dramatic shift in trader bets toward earlier and potentially deeper cuts.\nThis shift in sentiment is not occurring in isolation. Global markets often react in tandem to U.S. monetary policy signals. European and Asian equity indices also posted gains overnight, creating a synchronized wave of optimism. Analysts point to several catalysts for this change. First, recent inflation reports have shown consistent progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Second, labor market data, while still strong, indicates a gradual cooling. Finally, retail sales and manufacturing figures suggest the economy is moderating, reducing the need for restrictive policy.\nAnalyzing the Federal Reserve\u2019s Evolving Stance\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s primary mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. For nearly two years, its focus remained squarely on combating inflation through aggressive rate hikes. However, the economic landscape in early 2025 presents a more balanced picture. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) reports, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, have shown encouraging disinflation trends.\nCentral bank communications have subtly evolved. Recent minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings have introduced more discussion about the risks of overtightening. Several regional Fed presidents have given speeches acknowledging the cumulative impact of previous hikes. While no official pivot has been announced, the market is interpreting these signals as preparatory steps for a policy shift. This anticipatory trading is a classic market behavior, where asset prices adjust long before the official policy change occurs.\nExpert Analysis on Market Mechanics and Forward Guidance\nFinancial experts emphasize the critical role of forward guidance in today\u2019s markets. \u201cThe market is a discounting mechanism,\u201d explains Dr. Anya Sharma, Chief Economist at the Global Market Institute. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t wait for the event; it prices in the expected outcome. The rally in Dow Jones futures reflects a collective reassessment of the cost of capital and future corporate earnings. Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for companies, boost consumer spending through cheaper credit, and generally make stocks more attractive relative to bonds.\u201d\nThis dynamic is evident across market sectors. Rate-sensitive groups like technology, real estate, and consumer discretionary stocks are seeing outsized gains in futures trading. The following table illustrates the typical sector performance correlation with interest rate expectations:\nThe Global Context and Risk Sentiment Indicators\nBeyond domestic data, improving global risk sentiment provides a tailwind for U.S. equities.

Now the focus is back on the basics, with January inflation and retail sales plus early February factory readings due.

Materials lagged as metal prices weakened.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate-cut bets are about to be stress tested.\nThis week\u2019s data could quickly reprice expectations for the Bank of England. Cooler inflation alongside soft spending and output would reinforce the near-term cut being priced in, typically supporting rate-sensitive areas like banks and more UK-focused companies. But if inflation stays sticky, investors may push those cuts further out, and last week\u2019s volatility in financials could return.\nThe bigger picture: Higher rates are still reshaping who wins and loses.\nMonday showed a market that\u2019s less forgiving in a tight-money world. Deals can break when financing is pricey, as Pinewood\u2019s failed take-private underlined, and governance questions can hit confidence fast, as SkinBioTherapeutics found out.

As the oldest of five, she grew up alongside her brothers Bernard, Willard, and Gary, and her baby sister, Sally, offering steady guidance and setting a loving example from the very beginning.\nIn 1964, she married Dr. Gerald \u201cJerry\u201d Gehl, beginning a love story that spanned over six decades. Their early married life took them to San Diego while Jerry served in the United States Navy, where they welcomed their first daughter, Holly.\nFollowing their time in California, Carol and Jerry returned to Wisconsin and settled in Madison. There they experienced both profound sorrow and deep joy, losing their beloved son, Paul, at the age of two and welcoming their cherished daughter, Sara. Through every season of life, Carol showed what it meant to move forward with grace. The family later lived in Neenah before ultimately settling in Chippewa Falls, which they called home for the past 35 years.\nCarol was a devoted mother and an extraordinary role model for her daughters. As a registered nurse, she lived out her calling to care for others with skill and compassion. She was also deeply committed to defending the rights of women and gave generously of her time in service to her community. Among her many contributions, she was instrumental in creating a car seat distribution program for newborns when car seat laws were first enacted in the 1970s, a legacy that continues to protect families.\nCarol loved art and music and was an incredible seamstress, cook, and pianist. Her music filled the house, her meals gathered family, and her handmade creations became treasured heirlooms. She and Jerry also shared a love of travel and were fortunate to enjoy many adventures together, building a lifetime of memories side by side.\nCarol was preceded in death by her husband, Jerry, in 2023, and by her son, Paul. We take comfort in imagining their reunion and the continuation of a love that endures.\nShe is lovingly survived by her daughters, Holly (Tim) Reiter and Sara (Scott) Eidam; her grandchildren, Sophia and Joel Reiter, Gale and Andrew Eidam; and her great-grandson, Atlas, born in 2025. Carol was overjoyed to meet Atlas in December, a moment of pure happiness.\nIn every era of her life, Carol led with steadfast love, resilience, service, and strength. She leaves behind a family shaped by her example and a community better because she lived in it.\nThe family is deeply grateful to St. Croix Hospice for the extraordinary compassion, dignity, and comfort they provided during Carol\u2019s final days.\nA private family service will be held.\nIn lieu of flowers, those wishing to honor Carol\u2019s legacy of compassion and advocacy may consider a donation to Family Support Center, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, or the ACLU of Wisconsin, organizations whose missions reflect the causes she cared about deeply.\nVisits: 550\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"

Prices for gold and silver also fell.\nWeak economic data released Monday appeared to be clouding sentiment in Tokyo, and a 6.2% decline for tech giant SoftBank Group also pulled shares lower. The decline follows a big rally after a resounding win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s ruling party in a Feb. 8 general election.\nBy midday, the Nikkei 225 was down 1% at 56,237.65.\nTraders likely were locking in profits from the recent gains that took the Nikkei to record levels. Polls show Takaichi's popularity is slowly slipping, as hopes for economic revival from her plans to increase government spending and cut taxes subside.\nIn Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 8,964.10, while India's Sensex edged 0.1% lower. In Thailand, the SET was down less than 0.2%.\nEuropean shares ended mixed on Monday and trading in the U.S. was closed for Presidents Day. U.S. markets are set to reopen Tuesday.\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1% a day after one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.\nShare prices have been waxing and waning with fluctuations in confidence over massive investments in AI. Investors are also focused on inflation and how price pressures might affect interest rates.\nIn other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 65 cents to $63.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $68.36 a barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to 153.17 Japanese yen from 153.51 yen. The euro cost $1.1841, down from $1.1852.\nThe price of gold fell 1.4% and silver was down 3.4%.\nBitcoin fell 0.6% to about $68,500.\n___\nYuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama"
