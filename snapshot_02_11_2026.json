                "body": "Gold dips but holds $5,000 as US Dollar recovers on soft data\n- Gold slips despite weak US Retail Sales and softer labor costs signaling slowing economic momentum.\n- Fed rate cut bets rise as markets price deeper easing extending into 2026.\n- Focus shifts to February Nonfarm Payrolls to gauge labor market resilience or further weakness.\nGold price turns negative during Tuesday\u2019s session, even though worse than expected data in the US pushed investors to trim US Dollar shorts, pushing the yellow metal lower, but remaining above the $5,000 threshold. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades with losses of 0.72% at $5,022.\nXAU/USD slips modestly as traders square Dollar positions despite weaker US consumption and labor cost data\nRetail Sales in the US disappointed investors as consumers were spooked by higher prices, along with bad weather. Sales in the control group used to calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures contracted, following November\u2019s downwardly revised figure.\nThe Employment Cost Index cooled in Q4 2025, dipping compared to the previous print, an indication that the labor market could be weakening further as the ECI is viewed by Fed officials as a bellwether of labor market slack and a predictor of underlying inflation.\nFollowing the data releases, traders ramped up expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut rates in 2026 from 56.5 basis points of easing to 58.5, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nNevertheless, traders\u2019 eyes are on the Nonfarm Payrolls report coming on Wednesday, February 11. The US economy is foreseen adding 70K people to the workforce in January, well above December\u2019s 50K print. The Unemployment Rate Is projected to remain unchanged at 4.4%.\nDaily market movers: Gold fails to gain traction despite US Dollar weakness\n- Bullion prices remained capped as the Greenback remains steady. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the performance of six currencies versus the US Dollar, is flat at 96.78, a headwind for Gold.\n- Conversely, US Treasury yields are tanking, as depicted by the 10-year T-note trading down five basis points to 4.149%.\n- US households reduced spending as December Retail Sales were unchanged at 0% MoM, down from 0.6% in November, missing estimates for a 0.4% increase. Retail Sales for the Control Group shrank -0.1% in December, down from 0.2% in the previous month.\n- The Employment Cost Index (ECI) rose 0.7% in Q4 on a quarterly basis, after rising 0.8% in Q3, according to the Department of Labor.\n- Gold outlook remains bullish due to the debasement trade and physical buying by central banks, particularly the People\u2019s Bank of China. Data by the PBoC revealed that it added bullion to its reserves for the fifteenth consecutive month.\n- White House National Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett hedged against a possible bad reading on jobs data. He said that \u201cwe should expect slightly lower jobs numbers.\u201d\nTechnical outlook: Gold price to trade sideways, glued at around $5,000\nGold price continues to trade within the $5,000-$5,100 mark as traders remained unable to clear the top/bottom of the range, waiting for a fresh catalyst. Momentum as measured by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), although bullish, is aiming toward its neutral level. This indicates that sellers are capping Bullion\u2019s advance.\nIf Gold rises past $5,100, this opens the door for higher prices, like $5,200, followed by the January 30 peak at $5,451 and the record high near $5,600. On the downside, a move below $5,000 opens the door to test the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $4,910, followed by $4,800 and ahead of the February 2 low at $4,402.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflatio"

                "body": "Experts believe that the price of silver could hit $200 this year under the right market conditions. The precious metal tripled in value from January 2025 to January 2026, and investor demand remains high amid market uncertainty.\nSilver had an incredible run over the past year, surging from $30 per ounce in early 2025 to a high of $100 last month. This sustained rally has slowed down in recent weeks as investors took profits, leaving the asset perched at a price of roughly $80 per ounce today. However, with the supply of the precious metal tight and investor demand high, silver is expected to continue its upward trajectory in the new year despite the current cooldown.\nSome experts have anticipated that the price of silver could potentially go as high as $200 in 2026, although this type of rally could only happen under the right circumstances, and there would be a great deal of pain along the way. This is because the economic conditions that would permit silver to rise to this new height would be fraught with increased inflation and currency debasement. As the United States currently faces mounting economic uncertainty, many experts warn against this kind of wishful thinking for silver, as it would mean bad news for the economy.\nWill Silver reach $200 in 2026?\nPeter Reagan, a financial market strategist at Birch Gold Group, told CBS News that the current price of silver is undervalued relative to gold. Gold recently made a new all-time high of $5,350 last month as demand for precious metals soared. Reagan believes that silvers undervaluation compared to gold means there is plenty of room for exponential price growth in the new year. However, for the asset to reach a high of $200 in 2026 would require an extreme increase in inflation or decline in currency values. Vince Stanzione, founder and CEO at First Information said that a $200 price target for silver is likely ahead of U.S. midterm elections. He echoed Reagan\u2019s claim that it would require currency debasement to get to that level, which would mean bad news for the global economy.\nSupply-demand imbalances, increased investment appetite, and industrial demand are also key factors that could lead silver to reach new heights in 2026. Industrial demand for the use of silver in solar panels, electric vehicles, semiconductors, and other growing technological sectors is expected to continue in 2026. This increased demand has caused supply constraints, which additionally drive up value. Beyond tangible use-cases for silver, macroeconomic conditions have created increased psychological demand as well. Geopolitical uncertainty, a weakening U.S. dollar, and inflation fears have sent investors flocking to precious metals like silver as a safe haven for their money.\nThe case against $200 silver price in 2026\nBrett Elliot, director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange, noted that a major rally in silver is possible in 2026, although he doesn\u2019t believe it is likely. His argument against this is multifaceted, addressing the number of different factors that would all have to fall perfectly in place, allowing for a sustained rally to $200. While it is possible for the stars to align and create the ideal conditions for silver to double from its January high this year, he believes the odds are historically slim.\nOne notable point he made is that the largest threat to a sustained silver rally in 2026 is ironically its own success. What Elliot means is that if the price of silver continues to climb, industrial consumers may turn to alternatives to substitute for the metal as it becomes less affordable. He points to reports of China creating silver-free photovoltaics for solar panels as an argument that this is already beginning to take place. Additionally, even if industrial consumers don\u2019t fully replace silver in their operations, price increases may lead them to discover ways to reduce its broader use case. This would inherently result in decreased demand and, in turn, decreased p"

                "body": "New York, Feb 10, 2026, 05:50 EST \u2014 Premarket\n- Silver slipped, giving back some of its gains after a strong start to the week.\n- Precious metals lost a little ground as the dollar strengthened and equities firmed up.\n- This week, traders are eyeing U.S. payrolls and inflation data as the next big catalysts.\nSpot silver dropped 1.4% to $82.20 an ounce by 0900 GMT, reversing after a surge of almost 7% the prior day. A stronger dollar and a shift by investors back toward risk assets weighed on prices. 1\nSilver\u2019s acted like a momentum play since late January, swinging enough to shake out many holders. Now, with another batch of U.S. data on deck, the metal faces more rate speculation\u2014hawkish or dovish, either way. When markets get jumpy, silver typically tracks moves in the dollar and yields.\nThis week, traders are watching for two big reads: the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report lands Wednesday, followed by inflation numbers on Friday. Silver often takes a hit if rate cut bets get delayed\u2014since it doesn\u2019t pay interest, better real yields elsewhere make the metal less appealing.\nMonday\u2019s rebound had the hallmarks of a dollar-driven move. \u201cUnless silver clears $92.24, I\u2019m not convinced of a medium-term uptrend,\u201d wrote Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note cited by The Daily Star. The publication also pointed to bargain-hunting picking up as the greenback lost ground. 2\nThe iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV) ended the last session at $76.04, but premarket quotes had it down to $74.62, per Investing.com data. Moves like this show just how fast sentiment can swing, even in heavily traded silver names. 3\nIn India, MCX silver futures slipped Tuesday morning. Jigar Trivedi of IndusInd Securities put a short-term floor near \u20b92,58,000 per kg, with traders sitting tight for cues from U.S. macro data. 4\nSilver bulls are staring down a clear risk: any strong U.S. data could boost the dollar, squeezing demand for non-yielding assets further. Still, a weak jobs report or softer inflation would probably spark fresh rate-cut chatter. That scenario might pull the dollar lower and set up silver for another rally.\nSilver sits in a tricky spot, caught between its reputation as a safe haven and its role tied to industrial demand\u2014two forces often at odds. When stocks take off and rate expectations shift, that push-pull tends to muddy the price action.\nRight now, traders are eyeing Wednesday\u2019s U.S. payrolls number (Feb. 11) and Friday\u2019s inflation release (Feb. 13) as the key market events. Silver is in focus, with traders ready to react if the data knocks the dollar down\u2014or props it up again."

It details that in 2024, the market consumed 213K tons, valued at $235M, with Turkey accounting for 84% of consumption. Production was 217K tons. The market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of +1.4% in volume and +1.5% in value through 2035, reaching 247K tons and $277M. Turkey is the dominant producer, consumer, and trader. Imports fell sharply in 2024 to 3.5K tons, while exports were 8K tons, primarily refined oil from Turkey. The report includes detailed breakdowns by country, product type, and price trends.\nKey Findings\n- Turkey dominates the Middle East market, accounting for 84% of consumption and 85% of production\n- The market is forecast for modest growth with a +1.4% volume CAGR and +1.5% value CAGR from 2024 to 2035\n- Imports collapsed by -45.1% in 2024, while exports remained relatively strong at 8K tons\n- Refined cotton-seed oil constitutes nearly all exports, while imports are split between crude and refined types\n- Significant price disparity exists, with import prices at $935/ton and export prices at $1,257/ton in 2024\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by rising demand for cotton-seed oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to start an upward consumption trend over the next decade. The performance of the market is forecast to increase slightly, with an anticipated CAGR of +1.4% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 247K tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +1.5% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $277M (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Cotton-Seed Oil\nIn 2024, cotton-seed oil consumption in the Middle East amounted to 213K tons, surging by 3% against 2023 figures. In general, consumption, however, saw a slight setback. Over the period under review, consumption attained the peak volume at 240K tons in 2013; however, from 2014 to 2024, consumption failed to regain momentum.\nThe revenue of the cotton-seed oil market in the Middle East dropped to $235M in 2024, declining by -9.2% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). Overall, consumption continues to indicate a relatively flat trend pattern. As a result, consumption reached the peak level of $334M. From 2023 to 2024, the growth of the market failed to regain momentum.\nConsumption By Country\nThe country with the largest volume of cotton-seed oil consumption was Turkey (179K tons), accounting for 84% of total volume. Moreover, cotton-seed oil consumption in Turkey exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest consumer, Saudi Arabia (19K tons), ninefold. Iran (6.7K tons) ranked third in terms of total consumption with a 3.1% share.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual growth rate of volume in Turkey was relatively modest. In the other countries, the average annual rates were as follows: Saudi Arabia (+3.6% per year) and Iran (-6.9% per year).\nIn value terms, Turkey ($198M) led the market, alone. The second position in the ranking was held by Saudi Arabia ($21M). It was followed by Iran.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual growth rate of value in Turkey totaled +2.4%.

                "body": "Before OPEC, there was Texas: A better path for Venezuela\u2019s oil revival\nOp-Ed: For decades, global oil markets have been distorted by political cartels, centralized planning, and price manipulation masquerading as \u201cstability.\u201d Nowhere is that failure more obvious than Venezuela, a country sitting atop some of the largest oil reserves on Earth, yet crippled by corruption, mismanagement and ideology.\nWith Venezuela potentially reentering global energy markets, the question isn\u2019t whether oil will flow again. The question is under what system. If the goal is long-term stability, transparency, and real investment, the answer isn\u2019t OPEC, the answer is the Texas model.\nTHE TEXAS MODEL\nDespite its outdated and misleading name, the Railroad Commission of Texas does not regulate railroads. It hasn\u2019t for decades. Today, it is the world\u2019s oldest and most experienced oil and gas regulator, overseeing drilling, production, pipelines, and environmental safety in the largest energy-producing state in America.\nThe name is an historical artifact. The expertise is very real.\nSince 1917, long before most federal energy agencies even existed, the Railroad Commission has regulated Texas oil and gas production, using engineering, geology, data, and market principles. Under its watch, Texas has grown into the backbone of American energy security. Today, the state produces nearly half of all U.S. crude oil and leads the nation in natural gas production. If Texas were its own country, it would rank among the top oil producers on Earth.\nThat didn\u2019t happen by accident.\nFor many Americans, OPEC feels inevitable, a permanent fixture of global energy markets. But it isn\u2019t. OPEC was designed. And here\u2019s a fact that few acknowledge: it was explicitly modeled after the Railroad Commission of Texas.\nLong before OPEC existed, Texas faced a familiar problem: boom-and-bust cycles that wasted resources, destabilized markets, and harmed both producers and consumers. The Railroad Commission responded with disciplined, science-based regulation that balanced production, conserved resources, and stabilized markets. It worked so well that governments around the world tried to copy it.\nThe difference is that Texas stayed grounded in markets, while OPEC evolved into a political cartel, one driven by geopolitics, state-owned oil companies, and supply manipulation rather than transparency or efficiency. That distinction matters for Venezuela.\nFIXING VENEZUELA\nVenezuela\u2019s problem has never been geology. The Orinoco Belt holds staggering reserves, potentially the largest in the world. The problem is trust. Investors remember expropriation. Workers remember insecurity. Companies remember permits that took years instead of days. Capital does not flow into chaos.\nAs energy analyst (and former World Oil Contributing Editor) David Blackmon has noted, rebuilding Venezuela\u2019s oil sector requires a three-legged stool: credible investment terms, security for people and assets, and a regulatory system that actually functions. Remove any one of those legs, and the entire effort collapses.\nThis is where Texas can help; not by exporting ideology, but by exporting competence.\nThe Railroad Commission has spent more than a century proving that strong regulation and strong production are not opposites. They are partners. Permits are issued in days, not years. Environmental protection is grounded in science, not politics. Safety is enforced without strangling development. That balance is why investment flows to Texas while it flees less-stable jurisdictions.\nCompare that with OPEC.\nMOVING BEYOND OPEC\u2019S FAILED MODEL\nOPEC does not create market stability; it distorts price signals. Its decisions are shaped by internal power struggles and geopolitical leverage, not by supply and demand. It rewards scarcity, punishes innovation, and injects politics into markets that function best when left transparent and competitive.\nWhy would Venezuela rebuild its oil future on a model that failed it before?\nTher"

The US is considering seizing tankers with Iranian oil and deploying an aircraft carrier group.\nGlobal oil prices have resumed their growth amid the escalating geopolitical situation around Iran, which completely negated the negative impact of data on a significant increase in commercial crude oil inventories in the United States. The market is ignoring signs of a surplus, focusing on the risks of potential supply disruptions from the Middle East if diplomatic negotiations fail. This is reported by Bloomberg, writes UNN.\nDetails\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose above $64 per barrel, while the global benchmark Brent is trading at around $69. Traders are actively reacting to reports that the US is considering seizing tankers with Iranian oil and sending an additional aircraft carrier strike group to the region.\nSuch measures are seen as preparation for a forceful scenario if negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program reach an impasse.\nMarket surplus and energy agency reports\nAt the same time, internal data from the US indicate a significant market oversupply: the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported an increase in inventories of 13.4 million barrels last week. This is the largest figure since November 2023. If these figures are confirmed by the official government report, fundamental indicators may begin to put downward pressure on prices.\nIn the near future, investors are awaiting the monthly OPEC report and analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The latter has already warned of a possible significant surplus of raw materials in 2026, as the growth rate of global supply currently outpaces demand. Nevertheless, as long as the geopolitical factor remains dominant, prices will maintain an upward trend."

                "body": "Before OPEC, there was Texas: A better path for Venezuela\u2019s oil revival\nOp-Ed: For decades, global oil markets have been distorted by political cartels, centralized planning, and price manipulation masquerading as \u201cstability.\u201d Nowhere is that failure more obvious than Venezuela, a country sitting atop some of the largest oil reserves on Earth, yet crippled by corruption, mismanagement and ideology.\nWith Venezuela potentially reentering global energy markets, the question isn\u2019t whether oil will flow again. The question is under what system. If the goal is long-term stability, transparency, and real investment, the answer isn\u2019t OPEC, the answer is the Texas model.\nTHE TEXAS MODEL\nDespite its outdated and misleading name, the Railroad Commission of Texas does not regulate railroads. It hasn\u2019t for decades. Today, it is the world\u2019s oldest and most experienced oil and gas regulator, overseeing drilling, production, pipelines, and environmental safety in the largest energy-producing state in America.\nThe name is an historical artifact. The expertise is very real.\nSince 1917, long before most federal energy agencies even existed, the Railroad Commission has regulated Texas oil and gas production, using engineering, geology, data, and market principles. Under its watch, Texas has grown into the backbone of American energy security. Today, the state produces nearly half of all U.S. crude oil and leads the nation in natural gas production. If Texas were its own country, it would rank among the top oil producers on Earth.\nThat didn\u2019t happen by accident.\nFor many Americans, OPEC feels inevitable, a permanent fixture of global energy markets. But it isn\u2019t. OPEC was designed. And here\u2019s a fact that few acknowledge: it was explicitly modeled after the Railroad Commission of Texas.\nLong before OPEC existed, Texas faced a familiar problem: boom-and-bust cycles that wasted resources, destabilized markets, and harmed both producers and consumers. The Railroad Commission responded with disciplined, science-based regulation that balanced production, conserved resources, and stabilized markets. It worked so well that governments around the world tried to copy it.\nThe difference is that Texas stayed grounded in markets, while OPEC evolved into a political cartel, one driven by geopolitics, state-owned oil companies, and supply manipulation rather than transparency or efficiency. That distinction matters for Venezuela.\nFIXING VENEZUELA\nVenezuela\u2019s problem has never been geology. The Orinoco Belt holds staggering reserves, potentially the largest in the world. The problem is trust. Investors remember expropriation. Workers remember insecurity. Companies remember permits that took years instead of days. Capital does not flow into chaos.\nAs energy analyst (and former World Oil Contributing Editor) David Blackmon has noted, rebuilding Venezuela\u2019s oil sector requires a three-legged stool: credible investment terms, security for people and assets, and a regulatory system that actually functions. Remove any one of those legs, and the entire effort collapses.\nThis is where Texas can help; not by exporting ideology, but by exporting competence.\nThe Railroad Commission has spent more than a century proving that strong regulation and strong production are not opposites. They are partners. Permits are issued in days, not years. Environmental protection is grounded in science, not politics. Safety is enforced without strangling development. That balance is why investment flows to Texas while it flees less-stable jurisdictions.\nCompare that with OPEC.\nMOVING BEYOND OPEC\u2019S FAILED MODEL\nOPEC does not create market stability; it distorts price signals. Its decisions are shaped by internal power struggles and geopolitical leverage, not by supply and demand. It rewards scarcity, punishes innovation, and injects politics into markets that function best when left transparent and competitive.\nWhy would Venezuela rebuild its oil future on a model that failed it before?\nTher"

At the time of writing, the EUR/USD trades at 1.1895 after reaching a daily high of 1.1928.\nEuro eases despite weak US Retail Sales as Federal Reserve officials dampen near-term rate-cut expectations\nMarket mood remains negative as US equities turned negative in the day. Economic data from the US revealed that households are struggling with higher prices and show concerns about the labor market, as Retail Sales in December came at 0% MoM, below estimates for a 0.4% increase and November\u2019s 0.6% print.\nAt the same time, the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for the last quarter of 2025 rose by 0.7% QoQ, beneath the July-September quarter of 0.8% and missed estimates. The report suggests that there\u2019s some weakness in the labor market as policymakers use the ECI as a measure of jobs market slack.\nFed policymakers push back against lowering interest rates\nIn the meantime, Federal Reserve Regional Bank Presidents, crossed the wires. Dallas Fed Lorie Logan said commented that monetary policy is neutral, that inflation risks are tilted to the upside and that she is more concerned with that, than downside growth risks.\nEarlier, Cleveland\u2019s Fed Beth Hammack she was also hawkish, said that \u201cit is important to get 2% inflation before changing rates again.\u201d She added that inflation is too high and that tariff issues are still in play.\nIn Europe, the economic docket was absent on Tuesday, yet the European Central President Christine Lagarde seems confident that inflation in the bloc will stabilize at around 2% in the medium term.\nAside from this divergence between the Fed and the ECB, favors further EUR/USD upside. Data from Prime Market Terminal shows that money markets had priced in nearly 60 basis points of interest rate reductions of the Federal Reserve. Conversely, the ECB is projected to hold rates unchanged throughout the year and with first move expected to see being a rate rise.\nEconomic schedule for February 12\nThe Eurozone docket will feature speeches by ECB\u2019s Mario Cipollone and Isabel Schnabel. Across the pond, traders will eye Nonfarm Payrolls figures, the update of the Unemployment Rate and speeches by Fed officials Jeffrey Schmid, Michell Bowman and Beth Hammack.\nEuro Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this week. Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nTechnical outlook: EUR/USD to remain trading sideways, waiting for fresh catalyst\nThe EUR/USD trend is neutral, yet after establishing a higher lower low after hitting the yearly high of 1.20979 at around 1.1765. Since then, the pair has rallied towards 1.1900, though bullish momentum has faded as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\nFor a bullish outcome, traders are eyeing a decisive break above 1.1900. Once cleared, the next stop would be the January 30 high at 1.1974, followed by January 29 peak at 1.1996 ahead of 1.2000.\nConversely, if bears drive price below the 1.1850 area, it will expose the 1.1800 figure, followed by the February 6 cycle low of 1.1765.

The disappointing release of US Retail Sales figures on Tuesday lifted investors' expectations that the US central bank will lower interest rates multiple times this year. In contrast, the ECB has been on hold since ending a year-long run of rate cuts in June last year, and a surprisingly resilient growth has taken all pressure off the policymakers to provide any further support.\nMeanwhile, concerns about the Fed's independence resurfaced after US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he might sue his newly selected Fed chair nominee, Kevin Warsh, if he didn\u2019t lower interest rates. Furthermore, Fed Governor Stephan Miran noted that 100% central bank independence is impossible. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment, keeps the safe-haven Greenback depressed despite hawkish comments from a duo of Fed officials, saying that they would prefer to hold rates steady for now because of concerns about inflation.\nThe aforementioned fundamental backdrop favors the USD bears and suggests that the path of least resistance for the EUR/USD pair is to the upside. Hence, any corrective slide could be seen as a buying opportunity and is likely to remain limited. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive directional bets ahead of the crucial US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which, along with the US consumer inflation figures on Friday, will be looked for cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. This, in turn, will drive the USD and provide a fresh impetus to the EUR/USD pair.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro.

Strong support from the cabinet and various wings of the Labour Party means the Prime Minister will live to see another day in office.\nUK gilt yields rose yesterday after calls for Keir Starmer to step down and amid fears of a more left-wing Labour leader, such as Angela Rayner. However, yields on the 10-year gilt are down modestly again today, supporting the view that Starmer\u2019s position is stabilising.\nThe pound remains under pressure as investors weigh the political drama together with expectations that the Bank of England is close to cutting interest rates again. Inflation is expected to ease below 2% target as early as April, and with signs of weakness in the UK labour market, the Bank of England may cut rates potentially as soon as March.\nThe USD is holding steady on Tuesday after steep losses yesterday against its major peers, with attention turning to retail sales data, which could offer some support. Expectations are for retail sales to rise 0.4% month-on-month, a sign of solid consumption.\nHowever, the main focus will be on Wednesday's nonfarm payroll report and Friday's inflation figures for more clues on the timing of the next Fed rate cut.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGGBP/USD extended its recovery from the 1.30 November low, running into resistance at 1.3870 in late January and rebounding lower. The bearish momentum has faded, but GBP/USD\u2019s recovery has stalled around the 1.37 level.\nBuyers will need to rise above the 1.37 resistance zone to bring 1.38 back into focus ahead of 1.3870.

                "body": "USD/JPY extended its losses in early trading on Wednesday, February 11, as the dust settled from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s landslide election victory.\nIntervention warnings triggered a sharp drop in USD/JPY from a post-election result high of 157.660 to a February 11 low of 153.833. Price action in USD/JPY underscored the effectiveness of intervention warnings. Analysts previously predicted a markedly weaker yen if the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) \u2013 Japan Innovation Party (JIP) gained a supermajority in the Lower House.\nMeanwhile, US economic data will influence USD/JPY later on February 11 amid shifting bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. Crucially, speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike and Fed rate cuts continues to support a bearish medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nExpectations of a weaker Japanese yen in the aftermath of Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s landslide election win failed to materialize this week. Economists expected the yen to weaken, with USD/JPY potentially breaking above 160.\nHowever, Japan\u2019s top currency official Mimura and Finance Minister Katayama swiftly threatened to tackle any yen volatility stemming from the election outcome. These threats overshadowed the potential impact of fiscal spending policies on Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields, and yen demand.\nNotably, the Japanese government has been more vocal about intervening since Prime Minister Takaichi took office in October 2025. USD/JPY dropped to a 2026 low of 152.092 on January 27, weighed by intervention threats and the Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish quarterly projections.\nCrucially, the government\u2019s stance on yen volatility and the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy outlook support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans and the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook influence demand for the yen, US labor market data will be key for the US dollar.\nOn Wednesday, February 11, the delayed US jobs report will fuel speculation about an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. Economists expect average hourly earnings to rise 3.6% year-on-year (YoY) in January, down from 3.8% in December. Meanwhile, economists forecast unemployment to remain at 4.4%.\nSofter wage growth could raise bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, weighing on the US dollar. Typically, slower wage growth curbs consumer spending, dampening demand-driven inflation. Cooling inflationary signals would support a more dovish Fed rate path. Given these dynamics, an unexpected rise in unemployment would likely weigh more heavily on the US dollar.\nToday\u2019s data follows weaker-than-expected US JOLTs job openings and retail sales data. The numbers lifted bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a June Fed rate cut increased from 56% on February 3 to 75.2% on February 10.\nImportantly, a more hawkish BoJ policy stance and a more dovish Fed rate path would indicate narrowing US-Japan rate differentials in favor of the yen. Narrowing rate differentials would be bearish for USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should track technical indicators, incoming economic data, government fiscal policies, and central bank chatter.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), but holds above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signal a bearish near-term but bullish longer-term bias. Favorable yen fundamentals align with the short-term technicals, supporting a bearish medium-term outlook.\nA break below the 200-day EMA would signal a bearish trend reversal, bringing the 150 support level into play. If breached, 145 would be the next key support level.\nNotably, a sustained fall through the EMAs would reinforce the negative medium- to longer-term price outlook.\nIn my view, the prospect of BoJ rate hikes and Fed rate cuts supports a negative price outlook. However, upside risks to the"

Markets have interpreted this political stability as increasing the likelihood of fiscal expansion, particularly in areas such as defence and industrial policy.\nAt the same time, ING expects the Bank of Japan to deliver at least one additional rate increase, extending its gradual normalisation cycle. This contrasts with expectations for the Federal Reserve, where further rate cuts remain on the table over the course of the year. A narrowing of U.S.\u2013Japan yield differentials could reduce upward pressure on USD/JPY and support the yen.\nING suggests that under this scenario the dollar could drift closer toward the 150 yen level. However, the analysts also flag that any renewed move higher in USD/JPY toward the 158\u2013160 area would likely draw renewed yen buying interest. That zone has previously attracted attention from Japanese authorities, who have demonstrated a willingness to step in to curb excessive currency weakness.\nOverall, ING\u2019s framework points to a more constructive medium-term outlook for the yen, driven by diverging monetary policy paths and a firmer domestic political mandate in Japan. While volatility remains likely, the balance of risks may be shifting away from persistent yen depreciation and toward a more stable or gradually strengthening currency profile."

                "body": "USD/JPY hangs near one-week low; bears await break below 154.00 ahead of US NFP\n- USD/JPY struggles to attract any meaningful buyers and seems vulnerable to slide further.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed policy expectations validate the negative outlook for spot prices.\n- Bears, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of the key US NFP report.\nThe USD/JPY pair remains on the back foot below mid-154.00s through the Asian session on Wednesday and looks to build on its heavy losses registered over the past two days. Traders, however, seem reluctant and might opt to wait for the delayed release of the US monthly employment details.\nThe popularly known US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, originally scheduled for early February, was delayed due to a partial federal government shutdown and is expected to show that the economy added 70K new jobs in January. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.4%. This, along with Average Weekly Earnings, will play a key role in influencing the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy outlook, which, in turn, will drive the US Dollar (USD) and provide some meaningful impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nIn the meantime, bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times this year and concerns about the Fed's independence keep the USD close to an over one-week low, touched on Tuesday. In contrast, expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s expansionary policies will boost the economy and prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to stick to its hawkish stance continue to underpin the Japanese Yen (JPY). This, in turn, favors the USD/JPY bears and backs the case for a further near-term depreciating move.\nThat said, traders might opt to wait for a sustained break and acceptance below the 154.00 mark before positioning for deeper losses. Nevertheless, the broader fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the currency pair remains to the downside. Moreover, fears that Japanese authorities will intervene to support the JPY should keep the USD/JPY bulls on the sidelines and cap any meaningful recovery attempt from a one-and-a-half-week low, around the 154.00 neighborhood, touched on Tuesday.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nH"

Higher crude oil prices continue to underpin the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) against the Greenback. All eyes will be on the delayed US jobs data for January, which is due later on Wednesday.\nUS President Donald Trump threatened Iran with possible military attacks if Tehran does not accede to his demands on issues ranging from nuclear enrichment to ballistic missiles, per the Wall Street Journal. Persistent geopolitical risks could boost crude oil prices and provide some support to the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and high crude oil prices generally have a positive impact on the CAD.\nFurthermore, a shift in the Bank of Canada (BoC) monetary policy expectations might contribute to the CAD\u2019s upside. The Unemployment Rate in Canada fell to 6.5%, the lowest since September 2024, Statistics Canada showed last week. This figure came in better than the expectations of 6.8%. This report has reduced the downside risk to Canada\u2019s growth and policy outlook, narrowing expectations for aggressive BoC easing.\nTraders will closely monitor the delayed US employment report for more hints about the US interest rate outlook. Markets expect the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) to show 70,000 jobs added in the US economy in January, while the Unemployment Rate is projected to remain steady at 4.4% during the same period. In case of stronger-than-expected outcomes, this could lift the US Dollar (USD) against the CAD in the near term.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases de"

                "body": "Canadian Dollar February 10: Net\u2011Long Shift Pushes USD/CAD to 1.35\nThe Canadian dollar firmed on February 10 after CFTC data showed speculators turned net long CAD for the first time since August 2023. The USD/CAD pair is testing 1.3500, and a decisive break points to 1.3420 next. Resilient Canadian labour data and firmer oil add support, while broad USD softness helps near term. We explain what the shift means, the key trading levels to watch, and how the Bank of Canada could shape the path from here.\nCFTC Positioning Flip: Why It Matters\nCFTC positioning shows speculative accounts flipped to net long CAD for the first time since August 2023, signaling a sentiment shift that can fuel trend follow\u2011through. A fresh long base raises the chance of dips being bought if data stays firm. For context on the move and market reaction, see reporting from The Globe and Mail.\nPositioning is not a timing tool, but it can amplify price swings. When traders add to longs and the Canadian dollar rises, short covering can quicken momentum. If data weakens, crowded longs can unwind fast. We watch weekly changes in CFTC positioning alongside daily price action to gauge whether the trend is broadening or stalling.\nMacro Drivers Supporting the Loonie\nCanada\u2019s latest labour report signalled resilience, keeping growth expectations steady and supporting currency inflows. Stable employment and wages can temper recession worries and reduce volatility for importers and exporters. This backdrop gives the Canadian dollar a fundamental cushion as markets assess when the Bank of Canada might adjust policy, especially if inflation progress continues without undercutting employment.\nFirmer crude improves Canada\u2019s terms of trade and often supports CAD. While the relationship varies over time, rising energy prices typically help the trade balance and corporate cash flows. For perspective on why the currency sometimes lags despite commodities, see analysis from the Financial Post. If oil holds gains, it can reinforce the current CAD bid.\nUSD/CAD Technical Map for Traders\nPrice is pivoting around 1.3500. A clear daily close below that level would keep bears in control and opens a path toward 1.3420. Failure to break could see a rebound toward recent swing areas. We prefer trading with confirmation on closing levels, using tight risk on fades and wider stops on momentum breaks to respect volatility.\nWe look for a sequence of lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart to confirm trend continuation. A daily close below 1.3500, softening volume on rallies, and momentum indicators holding below neutral would support downside follow\u2011through. Conversely, a strong close back above 1.3500 with rising breadth would warn of a squeeze against Canadian dollar longs.\nBank of Canada and USD Backdrop\nThe Bank of Canada remains data dependent. Inflation is still being monitored against the 2% target, and the timing of any policy shift is uncertain. If upcoming CPI and retail sales show cooling without harming jobs, markets may price a gentler policy path, which can aid the Canadian dollar. Surprise re\u2011acceleration would challenge that view and lift rate expectations.\nBroad USD softness has helped CAD. If US growth and inflation cool, lower US yields typically weigh on the dollar, supporting downside in USD/CAD. Stronger US prints could reverse that, lifting USD and pressuring CAD. We track Treasury yields, core inflation trends, and risk sentiment to judge whether the US dollar impulse is fading or turning.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Canadian dollar enters the week with fresh support from a net\u2011long CFTC shift, resilient domestic data, and firmer oil. For traders, 1.3500 is the near\u2011term pivot on USD/CAD. A confirmed daily close below that level points to 1.3420, while a recovery above it risks a squeeze. We suggest pairing technical signals with weekly positioning updates for context. Canadian importers may trim short\u2011term USD exposure on confirmed breaks, while exporters can scale he"

                "body": "Canadian Dollar advances to nearly two-week top vs. USD as traders await US NFP\n- USD/CAD remains on the back foot for the fourth straight day amid a combination of factors.\n- Rising Crude Oil prices underpin the Loonie and weigh on spot prices amid a weaker USD.\n- Traders now look forward to the release of the US NFP report for some meaningful impetus.\nThe USD/CAD pair attracts fresh sellers following the previous day's two-way directionless price moves and slides back to a nearly two-week low, around the 1.3525-1.3520 region, during the Asian session on Wednesday. The US Dollar (USD) remains depressed amid bets for more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and concerns about the central bank's independence. Apart from this, renewed buying around Crude Oil prices underpins the commodity-linked Loonie, exerting additional pressure on the currency pair ahead of the crucial US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report.\nThe daily chart for USD/CAD shows a decisive bearish trend, with price trading well below both the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.3757 and the 200-day EMA at 1.3854, confirming sustained downside pressure. The pair peaked near 1.3928 in early January before rolling over into a series of lower highs and lower lows. The Canadian Dollar is now extending into a third consecutive bullish session, driving USD/CAD down 0.25% on Tuesday to 1.3525, approaching the recent swing low near 1.3481. The selloff from the January highs has carved out a clean descending channel on the daily timeframe, with the 50 EMA curling lower and now converging with the 200 EMA, suggesting the potential for a bearish crossover. Support sits at 1.3481 (the chart low), followed by the psychological 1.3500 handle, while resistance clusters around 1.3600 to 1.3650, where prior support has flipped and the recent consolidation zone formed in early February.\nThe Stochastic Oscillator (14, 5, 5) continues to middle, having turned lower from the midline without reaching overbought territory, signaling that bearish momentum is reasserting after the brief early-February corrective bounce. That bounce stalled near 1.3700 and produced a series of rejection candles with long upper wicks, pointing to persistent selling interest on rallies toward the declining moving averages. The Loonie's three-day rally has been supported by stronger Canadian labour data, with January unemployment falling to 6.5% and wage growth holding firm at 3.3%, which has repriced Bank of Canada (BoC) rate cut expectations lower and kept Canadian yields relatively attractive. On the US side, Tuesday's weaker-than-expected Retail Sales (0.0% versus 0.4% forecast) and softer Employment Cost Index (0.7% versus 0.8%) have added further weight to the US Dollar. A daily close below 1.3481 would confirm a fresh leg lower and open the path toward the 1.3400 area, while any corrective rally would need to reclaim 1.3650 to shift the near-term bias.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the "

                "body": "GBP/JPY struggles around mid-212.00s amid BoJ rate hike bets and UK political turmoil\n- GBP/JPY drifts lower for the second straight day, though it lacks follow-through selling.\n- Intervention fears and BoJ rate hike bets boost the JPY, exerting pressure on the cross.\n- The UK political chaos contributes to the GBP\u2019s underperformance and the intraday fall.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts sellers for the second straight day and slides back closer to the overnight swing low during the early part of the European session on Tuesday. Spot prices, however, remain confined in a one-week-old range and currently trade just above mid-212.00s.\nThe outcome of Japan's snap election on Sunday removes domestic political uncertainty. This, along with intervention warnings from Japanese authorities, underpins the Japanese Yen (JPY). Apart from this, bets that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path lend additional support to the JPY, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor exerting pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, continues with its relative underperformance on the back of political risk following the resignation of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's chief aide, Morgan McSweeney. Moreover, the Scottish Labour leader called for Keir Starmer to resign over the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. This further contributes to the offered tone surrounding the GBP/JPY cross.\nMeanwhile, firming expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates again mark a significant divergence in comparison to the BoJ's hawkish outlook and favor the GBP/JPY bears . However, concerns about Japan's fiscal situation on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's spending plans and a positive risk tone could cap the safe-haven JPY, which could limit losses for spot prices.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the e"

                "body": "LONDON, March 2025 \u2013 The GBP/JPY currency pair has plunged dramatically to its lowest level in nearly two months, trading around the mid-209.00s during Thursday\u2019s Asian session. This significant movement represents one of the most notable forex developments of the quarter, primarily driven by substantial Japanese Yen strength against multiple major currencies. Market analysts immediately noted the pair\u2019s rapid descent from recent highs above 212.50, marking a decisive shift in cross-currency dynamics that reflects broader macroeconomic forces.\nGBP/JPY Technical Breakdown and Market Context\nThe GBP/JPY\u2019s descent to approximately 209.50 represents a critical technical development. This level last appeared in early January 2025, establishing it as a significant support zone. Furthermore, the pair has broken below its 50-day moving average, typically indicating bearish momentum. Market data reveals substantial selling volume during the London-Asian session overlap, suggesting institutional participation in the move. Technical analysts highlight several key levels to watch, including immediate resistance at 210.20 and stronger support near 208.80.\nForex trading platforms reported increased volatility across Yen pairs during this period. The Japanese currency demonstrated strength not only against the British Pound but also versus the US Dollar and Euro. This broad-based appreciation suggests fundamental rather than technical drivers. Market participants closely monitored order flow data, which showed consistent selling pressure on GBP/JPY throughout the trading session. Consequently, the pair\u2019s decline appears systematic rather than speculative.\nBank of Japan Policy Shifts Driving Yen Strength\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s remarkable strength primarily stems from evolving monetary policy expectations. The Bank of Japan has recently signaled potential adjustments to its yield curve control framework. Market participants increasingly anticipate policy normalization after years of ultra-accommodative measures. Recent comments from BoJ officials suggest growing concern about sustainable inflation above the 2% target. This represents a significant departure from the previous decade\u2019s policy stance.\nExpert Analysis on Monetary Policy Divergence\nFinancial institutions have published numerous research notes analyzing this development. \u201cThe market is pricing in a fundamental shift in BoJ policy,\u201d noted currency strategist at a major investment bank. \u201cWhile the Bank of England maintains a cautious stance, the BoJ appears ready to normalize policy gradually.\u201d This policy divergence creates natural pressure on GBP/JPY as interest rate expectations adjust. Historical data shows that similar policy shifts in 2006-2007 and 2013-2014 produced sustained Yen strength against multiple currencies.\nEconomic indicators from Japan support this policy shift narrative. Core inflation has remained above the BoJ\u2019s target for 18 consecutive months. Wage growth negotiations during the spring Shunto season produced the largest increases in three decades. Manufacturing PMI data shows expansion for the seventh straight month. These factors collectively reduce the need for extraordinary monetary accommodation. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s current account surplus continues to provide fundamental support for the Yen during risk-off periods.\nBritish Pound Vulnerabilities and Economic Pressures\nThe British Pound faces multiple headwinds contributing to the GBP/JPY decline. Recent UK economic data has disappointed market expectations across several dimensions. Retail sales contracted more than anticipated in February, while manufacturing output showed unexpected weakness. Services PMI, while still in expansion territory, decelerated from previous readings. These indicators suggest the UK economy faces growth challenges despite inflation moderation.\nBank of England policy expectations have shifted significantly in recent weeks. Money markets now price in fewer rate cuts for 2025 than previo"

                "body": "LONDON, UK \u2013 January 15, 2025: The GBP/JPY currency pair has experienced significant weakening this week, dropping to multi-month lows as unprecedented political instability in the United Kingdom starkly contrasts with Japan\u2019s remarkable post-election economic calm. This divergence creates a powerful narrative in global forex markets, where political certainty increasingly drives currency valuations alongside traditional economic fundamentals.\nGBP/JPY Technical Breakdown and Current Market Position\nMarket data reveals the GBP/JPY pair trading at 178.50, representing a 2.3% decline from last week\u2019s opening. Technical analysts note the pair has broken through several key support levels, including the 180.00 psychological barrier and the 200-day moving average at 179.25. Furthermore, trading volume has surged by 45% above the 30-day average, indicating strong institutional participation in the downward move.\nSeveral factors contribute to this technical breakdown. First, the Bank of England maintains a cautious stance amid political uncertainty, delaying previously anticipated rate hikes. Second, Japanese institutional investors continue repatriating funds, strengthening Yen demand. Third, algorithmic trading systems have amplified the trend once key technical levels broke.\nUK Political Turmoil: A Multi-Layered Crisis\nThe United Kingdom faces its most significant political uncertainty since the Brexit negotiations. A minority government struggles to pass essential legislation after recent by-election losses eroded its parliamentary majority. Consequently, investors question the government\u2019s ability to implement its economic agenda.\nKey political developments affecting the Pound include:\n- Leadership challenges within the ruling party creating policy paralysis\n- Scottish independence referendum discussions resurfacing in political discourse\n- Post-Brexit trade agreement renegotiations with the European Union stalling\n- Fiscal policy uncertainty regarding taxation and public spending commitments\nThis political environment contrasts sharply with the stability typically required for currency strength. Historical data shows the Pound tends to weaken during periods of political uncertainty, with a correlation coefficient of -0.67 between political stability indices and GBP valuation over the past decade.\nEconomic Impacts of Political Instability\nPolitical uncertainty directly affects the UK economy through multiple channels. Business investment decisions face delays as companies await policy clarity. International capital flows show increased volatility, with foreign direct investment declining 18% year-over-year according to Office for National Statistics data. Furthermore, consumer confidence has dropped to levels not seen since the 2022 energy crisis.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee faces additional challenges in this environment. Their recent minutes reveal concerns about \u201csecond-round effects\u201d of political uncertainty on inflation expectations and wage-setting behavior. Consequently, market participants now price in fewer rate hikes for 2025 than previously anticipated.\nJapan\u2019s Post-Election Stability: Structural Reforms and Policy Continuity\nJapan presents a contrasting picture following its recent general election. The ruling coalition secured a stronger mandate than expected, winning 293 of 465 lower house seats. This outcome provides political stability for implementing the government\u2019s economic agenda, particularly the \u201cNew Capitalism\u201d initiative focusing on wage growth and digital transformation.\nThe Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance, but with important nuances. Governor Kazuo Ueda recently emphasized the central bank\u2019s commitment to supporting the economy until sustainable 2% inflation appears. However, the bank has begun subtle policy normalization through yield curve control adjustments.\nKey factors supporting Yen stability include:\n- Political continuity ensuring consis"

According to the filings, Goldman Sachs also had hundreds of thousands in IBIT calls and puts.\nGoldman\u2019s path into Bitcoin began more than half a decade ago with tentative forays into the asset class. In 2022, the firm executed its first known BTC-backed loan and a non-deliverable Bitcoin options trade \u2014 milestones that marked early strategic steps into digital assets.\nYet for much of its history, Goldman was publicly circumspect about crypto, with executives in earlier years distancing the bank from Bitcoin as an investable class.\nThat posture shifted notably in 2024, when Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings revealed the bank\u2019s first meaningful accumulation of Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund.\nInstitutional filings from that period show Goldman tripling its Bitcoin ETF stake within months, bringing its holdings to roughly $1.5 billion and making it one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin ETFs.\nFilings from today also showed that Goldman Sachs held Ethereum, XRP, and Solana\nRecent bitcoin price action\nAll this is happening as Bitcoin has struggled to hold its footing above the psychologically key $70,000 level.\nBitcoin saw a sharp selloff last week, breaking down through the $70,000 and $60,000 ranges before finding support near $60,000. After capitulating at that level, bulls managed a strong rebound, pushing the price back up to around $71,700 before closing the week near $70,315.\nDespite the bounce, overall sentiment remains bearish, as bears controlled most of the downside move.\nKey resistance levels have shifted following the decline. The first area to watch is $71,800, where the price was rejected. Above that, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement sits near $74,500, with stronger resistance expected at $79,000 and $84,000.\nOn the downside, bulls need to hold $65,650 and $63,000 to maintain a reversal attempt. The $60,000 level is now critical support, sitting just above the 0.618 retracement at $57,800, which may represent the true floor."

                "body": "Key takeaways:\n- Bitcoin price faces volatility around $70K.\n- Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC\u2019s price to reach $150K by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event.\n- By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption.\nBitcoin\u2019s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they\u2019ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast.\nHowever, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable.\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?\u201d or \u201cWill Bitcoin go up?\u201d or \u201cWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?\u201d Let\u2019s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.\nOverview\nBitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis\nBitcoin price analysis\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- BTC price analysis shows that sellers are defending the $72K level strongly, preventing any short-term recovery.\n- Resistance for BTC is at $72,658\n- Support for BTC/USD is at $60,011\nThe BTC price analysis for 10 February confirms that BTC faces strong resistance from sellers as the price consolidates below $70K. Currently, the Bitcoin price is aiming for a recovery above $72K.\nBTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces resistance around $72K\nAnalyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it faced strong resistance around $72K. Currently, the BTC price is facing minor selling domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.54 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $69,096, decreasing by over 1.1% in the last 24 hours.\nThe RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 32, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.\nBTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Selling domination rises around EMA trend lines\nThe 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $70K.\nThe BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.24, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend.\nAdditionally, the MACD indicator has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders\u2019 confidence.\nBitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from BTC price analysis next?\nThe hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC\u2019s price holds momentum above $72,658, it will fuel a bullish rally to $80,338.\nIf bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $60,011, beginning a bearish trend to $55,494.\nIs Bitcoin a good investment?\nThe rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risk"

Developers will be able to publicly build on the network for the first time after six months of private testing, ahead of a future mainnet launch, the company announced at CoinDesk's Consensus Hong Kong conference.\nWith the chain, Robinhood aims to allow users to trade 24/7 and self-custody their assets in Robinhood's own crypto wallet. Users will also be able to bridge across different chains and to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum\nThe timing comes as Ethereum\u2019s core roadmap shifts more attention back to the base layer. Certain upgrades have already lowered transaction costs, and further improvements are expected to continue easing congestion, a development that weakens the case for layer-2s as a pure scaling necessity.\nRobinhood\u2019s approach suggests it is already operating under that assumption.\n\u201cI think Vitalik [Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum] was always pretty clear on this, that L2s were not just here to scale Ethereum,\u201d said Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood\u2019s senior vice president and general manager of crypto, in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\u201cFor us, it was never really about scaling Ethereum or doing faster transactions,\u201d Kerbrat added.\nThe move builds on Robinhood's earlier steps into tokenization. Last year, the company rolled out token versions of U.S. stocks and ETFs for European users with dividend payments and extended market hours.\nThose assets \u2014 almost 2,000 stocks and ETFs, according to data by Entropy Advisors on Dune Analytics \u2014 were initially issued on Arbitrum. However, the $15 million in total value of the equity tokens Robinhood minted is lagging behind leading issuers xStocks and Ondo Global Markets.\nWhen rollups \u2014 ways of processing transactions on layer-2 networks to ease congestion on the base network \u2014 first gained traction, they were widely framed as Ethereum\u2019s answer to high fees and limited throughput. As Ethereum's layer-1 capacity improves, that narrative is giving way to a different one: layer-2s as customizable, application-specific environments that can embed features difficult to implement on Ethereum itself.\n\u201cWhat we wanted was the security of Ethereum, the liquidity that is available on EVM chains and the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Kerbrat said. \u201cBut we were also wanting to have a way to customize the chain and to make it really optimized for traditional assets being tokenized.\u201d\nRather than competing with other high-speed trading-focused rollups, Robinhood Chain is being designed around tokenized equities and other regulated financial products, where compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction.\n\u201cThe complexity to recreate the entire financial system, and on top of that to bring more things on it, makes it that I think chains are going to specialize,\u201d Kerbrat said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see chains that "

The network is positioned as an open, developer-friendly blockchain that allows anyone to deploy smart contracts and build applications.\nRobinhood says this supports its goal of making financial assets accessible around the clock without intermediaries or platform lock-in.\nThe testnet gives developers access to network endpoints, documentation, and compatibility with standard Ethereum tools. Infrastructure providers Alchemy, Allium, Chainlink, LayerZero, and TRM have already begun integrating with the chain ahead of a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year.\n\u201cWe look forward to building alongside our infrastructure partners as we work to bring financial services onchain,\u201d Kerbrat stated.\nSteven Goldfeder, co-founder and chief executive of Offchain Labs, said the chain is built to deliver \u201cthe next chapter of tokenization and permissionless financial services.\u201d\nRobinhood introduced more than 200 tokenized US equities for European customers in late 2025, and the new blockchain will eventually host those offerings.

Now Ethereum hums along, cheap and steady, processing $15 billion daily in DeFi volume while pretenders fade into the noise. It\u2019s not sexy, nobody\u2019s writing odes to PeerDAS or blobspace, but the numbers whisper a truth: Ethereum isn\u2019t just surviving the scaling wars. It\u2019s winning them, quietly folding rivals into its orbit. Walk into any Mumbai crypto co-working space or Singapore fund office, and the screens tell the story. Aave, Uniswap, Maker, $180 billion TVL, 62% of DeFi\u2019s total, still live on Ethereum or its rollups. Solana pumps memes. Sui chases gaming. But when real money needs settlement, battle-tested security, and composability that doesn\u2019t evaporate in a bear market? They come home to ETH. The Modular Masterstroke Ethereum\u2019s secret isn\u2019t one breakthrough. It\u2019s the stack. Base layer slims down to consensus and data availability, PeerDAS live, blobs carrying 80% of rollup posts. Execution? Shoved to 50+ L2s, where fees dip under a penny and TPS rivals Visa\u2019s peak hour. AggLayer dreams and shared sequencing loom, but even without them, the machine works. Take last month\u2019s $40 million Blast exploit. Blast went dark. Ethereum L1 chugged on. Aave V3 on Arbitrum absorbed the fallout without blinking. Rollups inherit the mothership\u2019s security, 7+ years of attack surface seasoning, while running circles around monolithic L1s. Solana halts on spam. Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem just routes around. Vitalik\u2019s been here before. His \u201camateur hour is over\u201d riff from Devcon rings truer now than ever. ZK-EVMs mature (Taiko, zkSync hit production parity). Optimistic rollups shed training wheels. The trilemma doesn\u2019t haunt anymore; it\u2019s engineered away, layer by layer. Composability: The Moat That Matters Here\u2019s the real magic, the bit TradFi envies and L1 tourists overlook. Ethereum\u2019s DeFi isn\u2019t silos. It\u2019s Lego. Uniswap liquidity fuels Aave flash loans, which compound into Yearn strategies, which feed Pendle fixed yields, all settled on shared state, zero trust assumptions beyond the base layer. Try that on Solana. DEXes work great until a network stutter strands your position mid-arbitrage. Cross-chain bridges? $2 billion lost since 2022. Ethereum\u2019s rollups talk natively, intent-based bridging via Across, shared liquidity via Socket. Even Polygon\u2019s $250 million Coinme bet leans on AggLayer to knit UPI ramps into this web. The data dazzles. DeFiLlama pegs Ethereum ecosystem volume at 3.2x Solana\u2019s monthly average. Stablecoin swaps? 78% ETH-denominated. Institutional flows (BlackRock BUIDL, Barclays Ubyx pilots)? They settle on Arbitrum or Optimism, not some unproven L1. Network Effects Trump Hype Cycles Ethereum\u2019s other edge lives in people. 4,500 active devs monthly, double the field. Flashbots, Lido, the ERC-4337 bundle army, they iterate in public, Discord war rooms, turning theory into mainnet. Solana\u2019s Rust wizards chase throughput. Ethereum\u2019s army builds infrastructure. Culture compounds it. \u201cEthereum-aligned\u201d became shorthand for serious. Rollup teams beg for EF grants. VCs triage by blob compatibility. Even Saga\u2019s chainlet halt, a $7 million DeFi drainer, pushed survivors toward Ethereum\u2019s light-client proofs. Bear markets test this. 2025\u2019s macro wobbles saw $60 billion flee risk assets. Solana TVL halved. Ethereum\u2019s core, AAVE, UNI, and MKR dipped 20%, then stabilized. Why? Battle scars. Ronin, Poly, Wormhole, Ethereum ate those Ls, patched, iterated. New L1s? Still proving the basics. TradFi\u2019s Grudging Nod Wall Street notices. JPM\u2019s Kinexys swaps settle on Arbitrum testnets. Fidelity tokenizes real estate on Base. Polygon\u2019s U.S. ramps (Coinme, Sequence) feed USDC into Ethereum pools. Stablecoin \u201cwar\u201d? More like convergence, Circle\u2019s USDC processes 85% of its volume on Ethereum L2s. India\u2019s clampdown plays here too.

The cryptocurrency currently trades at $86.72, well below its 50-day moving average of $123.11 and 200-day average of $166.24. This sharp pullback raises critical questions about whether Solana USD can stabilize at key support levels or if further downside awaits. Understanding the technical backdrop and market dynamics becomes essential for tracking this large-cap crypto mover.\nSolana USD Price Action and Market Context\nSolana USD has faced relentless selling pressure throughout February 2026. The token opened at $86.93 and currently sits at $86.72, showing minimal daily movement but significant longer-term deterioration. The year-to-date decline stands at 34.79%, while the one-year loss reaches 58.79%. However, the three-year performance tells a different story, with gains of 310.92% reflecting Solana\u2019s historical strength as a blockchain platform.\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap remains substantial at $46.69 billion, though trading volume has declined to $4.07 billion daily against an average of $344.57 million. This volume compression suggests reduced conviction among traders. The day\u2019s range of $82.77 to $88.65 reflects continued volatility, with the token struggling to establish clear directional momentum in either direction.\nSolana USD Technical Analysis\nThe technical picture for Solana USD presents mixed signals across multiple indicators. The RSI at 52.08 sits in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting the selling pressure has paused temporarily. The MACD shows -0.56 with a signal line at -3.13, indicating a bearish crossover that has not yet reversed, though the histogram at 2.58 hints at potential momentum divergence.\nThe ADX reading of 27.02 confirms a strong downtrend remains in place, with trend strength well above the 25 threshold. Price action relative to Bollinger Bands shows Solana USD trading near the middle band at $128.03, with the lower band at $115.30 and upper band at $140.76. Support and resistance levels are critical: the lower Bollinger Band at $115.30 and Keltner Channel lower at $116.89 represent key downside targets if selling resumes.\nSolana USD Price Forecast\nMonthly forecasts suggest Solana USD could test $52.30 by month-end, representing a 39.7% decline from current levels if bearish momentum accelerates. This target aligns with the token\u2019s recent monthly decline and would test psychological support zones. The quarterly forecast points to $142.85, implying a recovery of 64.8% from current prices as market conditions potentially stabilize.\nThe yearly forecast targets $203.12, suggesting a 134.2% gain from February 2026 levels if longer-term recovery patterns emerge. Three-year projections reach $256.90, while five-year targets extend to $310.63. These forecasts reflect historical volatility and potential ecosystem growth, though they remain subject to regulatory changes, market sentiment shifts, and technological developments. Forecasts may change due to market conditions, regulations, or unexpected events.\nMarket Sentiment and Trading Activity\nTrading activity in Solana USD reflects cautious positioning as of February 11, 2026. The Money Flow Index at 66.70 indicates moderate buying pressure despite the downtrend, suggesting some accumulation at lower prices. The Stochastic %K at 72.60 and %D at 79.37 show overbought conditions in the short term, which could trigger profit-taking or consolidation.\nLiquidation data shows the On-Balance Volume at -114.69 billion, reflecting sustained selling pressure from larger holders. The Awesome Oscillator at 5.60 remains positive but weak, indicating momentum has not fully reversed. The CCI at 83.94 suggests some strength in upward price movements, though this conflicts with the bearish MACD signal. Overall, market sentiment appears cautious with se"

But as market conditions change, investors are now asking a critical question: can Solana reach $200 in 2026, or is its strongest growth already behind it.\nThis article looks at Solana price predictions for 2026, key resistance levels, and the factors influencing investor sentiment. As SOL faces stronger competition and a higher market cap, some traders are beginning to shift focus toward alternative crypto projects with more room for growth.\nSolana is a high speed blockchain designed for scalable decentralized applications. It focuses on fast transactions, low fees, and a developer friendly environment. Over time, it has built a strong ecosystem across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and payments. This activity helped Solana reclaim its position as a top layer one network.\nAt the time of writing, SOL trades around the $80 to $90 range. Its market cap sits near $50, placing it among the largest crypto assets. With this size comes stability, but also limits on exponential growth. Technically, analysts point to resistance zones near $100. These levels have repeatedly attracted selling pressure. A clean break above them would require strong volume and broad market support.\nWhile Solana remains technologically strong, it faces structural challenges. Network outages in prior years damaged long term confidence, even though reliability has improved. Competition is also intense. Ethereum scaling solutions, newer layer one chains, and modular blockchains all compete for the same developers and users.\nAnother issue is valuation. With a large circulating supply and high market cap, price growth requires massive capital inflows. Moving SOL from $90 to $180 would require tens of billions in new demand. That is possible, but far from guaranteed in a maturing market. As a result, many analysts now see Solana as a slower growth asset rather than a breakout play.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol built on Ethereum that allows users to borrow and lend without giving up custody of their funds. All activity is handled through smart contracts, which helps reduce counterparty risk and improve transparency.\nThe protocol is designed with two lending mechanisms. Pooled liquidity is used for standard, lower risk markets, while a peer to peer system, planned for later stages, is intended for higher risk or custom lending scenarios. This structure is meant to balance flexibility with clear risk controls.\nMUTM is currently in its presale phase, with the token priced around $0.04 in the current stage and a confirmed listing price of $0.06. Earlier participants entered at lower levels through structured presale rounds. The project is still in its build out phase, which means adoption and usage will play a key role in future growth.\nRecent progress includes the V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet, where users can already test core features such as liquidity pools, mtToken yield tracking, and automated risk management. This early delivery gives Mutuum room to grow if development continues to match execution.\nLooking ahead to 2026, Solana's price outlook appears constrained. A conservative scenario places SOL between $120 and $140 if market conditions remain mixed. A bearish case could see it revisit the $65 to $70 range if liquidity tightens or competition accelerates. These outcomes reflect Solana's size and dependence on broader market cycles rather than internal growth alone.\nMutuum Finance presents a very different profile. As a low market cap project with utility tied directly to lending activity, its upside depends more on adoption than market rotation. As long as the protocol gains users and locks value as expected, analysts believe MUTM could trade between $0.25 and $0.40 after launch cycles. This potential appreciation reflects how early stage DeFi "

                "body": "US stock futures steadied on Wednesday, February 11, after the previous day\u2019s mixed session, as focus shifted toward the US jobs report and key earnings.\nThe delayed US jobs report will be the main event of the Wednesday session, with markets expecting weak labor market data. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett recently warned that US labor market data could be weaker in the near term.\nRising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut overshadowed concerns about the US economy, lifting sentiment in the Asian session. The Hang Seng Index gained 0.23%, while the ASX200 rallied 1.47%, joining US equity futures in the green.\nCrucially, rising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut support a medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nWhile market focus remains fixed on the US economic calendar, Chinese economic data drew interest early on in the Wednesday session.\nChina\u2019s annual inflation rate cooled from 0.8% in December to 0.2% in January despite consumer prices rising 0.2% month-on-month (MoM) (December: 0.2% MoM). Meanwhile, producer prices fell 1.4% year-on-year (YoY) in January after declining 1.9% (YoY) in December.\nTypically, softer inflation suggests waning domestic consumption as consumer confidence sinks, which would challenge Beijing\u2019s efforts to boost spending. However, the softer headline inflation stemmed from lower energy prices and consumers holding back on spending ahead of the Lunar New Year, suggesting temporary weakness.\nA positive from the January figures was the less marked decline in producer prices, suggesting an improving demand backdrop. Producers adjust prices based on demand, passing cost savings or increases on to consumers. Improving demand would signal a pickup in global trade, supporting risk assets.\nUS futures posted gains during the Asian session on February 11. The Dow Jones E-mini climbed 117 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 106 points and 21 points, respectively.\nLater on Wednesday, US labor market data will influence expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. Economists forecast average hourly earnings will rise 3.6% year-on-year in January, down from 3.8% (YoY) in December. Meanwhile, economists expect unemployment to remain at 4.4% in January, while predicting the participation rate to drop from 62.4% to 62.3%. A lower participation rate can distort unemployment numbers.\nDeteriorating labor market conditions and softer wage growth would indicate a drop in consumer spending, cooling demand-driven inflation. A weaker inflation outlook would support a more dovish Fed policy stance. Lower borrowing costs could boost corporate profits and stock valuations, supporting the bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nWith the US labor market in focus, traders should closely monitor Fed chatter. Views on inflation, the labor market, and monetary policy will influence risk sentiment.\nBeyond the US economic data, the earnings calendar also needs consideration. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) is among the marquee names to release earnings results. Given its retail focus, its outlook will give further clues on the demand environment. Upbeat earnings and positive outlooks would likely fuel demand for risk assets.\nDespite the morning gains, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini remained below its 50-day EMA, while holding above its 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signaled a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini traded above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating a bullish bias, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical risks, earnings, US economic data, and central bank rhetoric. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook is cautiously bullish. Meanwhile, expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and upbeat earnings reinforce the "

Other blue-chip indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 continued their uptrend.\nThe Dow Jones has done well in the ongoing earnings season.

Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming report to show that the economy created 70,000 jobs in January, higher than the 50k it created in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.4%.\nThese numbers come as some major American companies have recently announced layoffs. Amazon is shedding over 16,000 layoffs on top of the 15,000 it announced last year.\nOther top companies, including UPS, Dow Inc., Verizon, Citigroup, and Salesforce, have announced large layoffs. According to Challenger & Gray, companies announced over 108k layoffs.\nThe most important data will come out on Friday when the United States will publish the latest consumer inflation report. Economists expect the data to show that inflation softened a bit in January, with the headline CPI falling to 2.5%.\nA lower inflation figure than expected will be highly bullish for the Dow Jones as it will lead to higher odds of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year."

                "body": "FTSE 100: London Stocks Fall as Europe Trades Mixed; Keir Starmer Strengthens Grip as PM\nThe FTSE 100 index in London weakened today as European markets traded with mixed results and investors reacted to ongoing political developments in the United Kingdom. The FTSE 100 slipped as traders balanced economic data, corporate earnings, and political news involving Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership. The setback on the UK blue-chip index came amid diverging trends across major European bourses and shifting global economic expectations. Recent movements in key sectors and broader market sentiment influenced investor behaviour in London and beyond.\nUnderstanding how political stability, global markets, and economic indicators affect UK equities has become essential for investors doing stock research and tracking performance in Europe. The FTSE 100 remains a top gauge of market confidence and is watched closely in the broader stock market landscape.\nWhat Happened in the Markets Today\nLondon\u2019s FTSE 100 index moved lower as trading opened and continued through the session. European markets showed mixed performance, with some indexes like Germany\u2019s DAX and others in continental Europe ticking higher or falling marginally. The mixed direction overseas created a sense of caution among investors in the UK equity market.\nIn early European trading, the DAX closed slightly lower, and other major markets including parts of France and Italy showed varied performance, signaling that confidence among investors was uneven across the region. This mixed environment contributed to the decline in the FTSE 100.\nRecent Trends in the FTSE 100 Index\nOver the past year, the FTSE 100 has shown periods of strong gains and notable corrections. In 2025, the index rallied more than 21%, marking one of its best annual performances since 2009, even as domestic investor participation declined significantly. Retail equity fund outflows in the UK reached more than \u00a311 billion, extending a decade-long trend of net withdrawals from UK equity funds despite rising stock prices.\nIn contrast, some market sessions saw the FTSE 100 move below key thresholds as global interest rate outlooks and inflation data influenced sentiment. For example, in late 2025, mixed earnings and weaker gross domestic product readings pushed the FTSE 100 down by over 100 points in a single session, underlining how economic data can affect the benchmark.\nPolitical Developments and Market Impact\nPolitical dynamics in the UK have begun influencing market sentiment around the FTSE 100. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced internal pressure following resignations within his senior team tied to a controversial ambassadorial appointment. This created some unease among investors, particularly those sensitive to policy direction and political stability. However, key cabinet members voiced support for Starmer, which helped calm some market nerves.\nPolitical shifts often affect currency values, government bond yields, and investor confidence. These factors can indirectly influence the performance of the FTSE 100 as they impact corporate earnings expectations and capital flows into UK stocks.\nSector Performance Within the FTSE 100\nBanking and Financial Services\nThe financial sector forms a significant part of the FTSE 100 and often influences its direction. Today, banking stocks showed mixed trends as investors assessed earnings and strategic announcements by major lenders. Changes in interest rate expectations and regulatory outlooks are closely watched by analysts and traders alike.\nMining and Commodities\nMining and commodity shares occasionally help support the index during broader weakness. When commodity prices rise, many mining stocks benefit, which can cushion declines in other sectors. This kind of sector rotation is common in the FTSE 100 due to the heavy weighting of resource companies in the index.\nTechnology and Data Providers\nTech and data firms listed in London have experienced volatility re"

After a series of choppy sessions, German blue chips are hovering around an important zone where bulls are trying to defend the uptrend while bears are leaning hard on every bounce. Volatility is elevated, moves are sharp, and every new data point on inflation, growth, or the ECB can flip the tone from cautious optimism to defensive panic in a single session. This is not a sleepy sideways market; this is active trader territory.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Dive into fresh DAX 40 chart breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Watch viral DAX trading setups and strategies on TikTok\nThe Story: Right now, the DAX 40 is sitting at the crossroads of three huge forces: ECB policy, the global dollar cycle, and Germany\u2019s own macro reality shock.\n1. ECB Policy: Lagarde vs. the Cycle\nThe European Central Bank, under Christine Lagarde, is walking a tightrope. Inflation has cooled from its peak, but services inflation and wage dynamics are still sticky. At the same time, growth in Germany looks fragile: weak industrial production, soft orders, and a manufacturing sector that has been under pressure for months.\nThe ECB knows this. Every press conference is a balancing act: sound tough enough to keep inflation expectations anchored, but flexible enough not to crush an already tired economy. For DAX traders, that tension is everything.\nWhen the ECB signals a slower pace of cuts or keeps a hawkish tone, financials and value names can get a short-term boost, but rate-sensitive growth names and exporters feel the pressure. When the rhetoric softens and the market starts to price in more easing, the script flips: tech, industrials, and cyclicals tend to catch a strong bid, and the DAX often reacts with a powerful risk-on push.\n2. Euro vs. USD: The FX Lever on DAX Earnings\nNever ignore the EUR/USD when you trade the DAX. A weaker euro versus the dollar is usually a tailwind for the index, especially for export-heavy giants like Siemens, SAP, the auto names, and industrial machinery players. Their global revenues translate more favorably into euros, and the market often prices that in ahead of the earnings season.\nWhen the euro softens, you often see a supportive backdrop for the DAX: German exporters look more competitive globally, margins get a bit of relief, and foreign investors find European assets cheaper in dollar terms. That can attract institutional flows back into Germany after long periods of underweight allocations.\nFlip side: if the euro strengthens aggressively against the dollar because the market decides the ECB will stay tighter for longer than the Fed, that can quickly remove one of the key props under DAX earnings expectations. In that scenario, every disappointment in macro data or company guidance hits harder, because the currency isn\u2019t helping anymore.\nRight now, the DAX is trading in an environment where FX is not a sideshow. The euro-dollar trend is an integral part of the index story, adding an extra layer of risk and opportunity for active traders.\n3. Macro Reality: Germany\u2019s Soft Spot\nLayered on top of ECB drama is Germany\u2019s own macro slowdown. Recent German manufacturing PMI readings have repeatedly hovered in weak territory, signaling contraction in core industries. New orders are fragile, export demand is uneven, and high financing costs still weigh on investment. For an economy built on high-value manufacturing, that hurts.\nEnergy remains a structural overhang. While spo"

Price action is swinging in a wide range, with sharp rallies getting sold and deep dips attracting aggressive dip-buyers.

Let\u2019s unpack the big forces: central banks, currencies, sectors, and sentiment.\n1. ECB Policy, Lagarde, and the Euro/USD Tug-of-War\nThe European Central Bank under Christine Lagarde is stuck in one of the tightest corners in modern monetary history. On one side, you have stubborn inflation that refuses to fully disappear. On the other, you have a German economy flirting with stagnation, weak industrial production, and a manufacturing sector that feels like it is constantly walking into a headwind.\nThe ECB cannot simply slam rates back to ultra-low crisis levels without re-igniting inflation fears. At the same time, holding policy too tight risks freezing credit, hurting already pressured companies, and deepening the growth slowdown. This balancing act is exactly what keeps DAX traders on edge.\nHere is where the Euro versus the US Dollar comes in. A softer Euro can be a secret weapon for the DAX: German exporters become more competitive globally, their products cheaper in dollar terms, and foreign earnings translate into more Euros on the income statement. That is a tailwind for global giants inside the index, especially industrials and exporters.\nBut a stronger Euro can flip the script. If markets expect the ECB to stay hawkish for longer than the Fed, the Euro can firm up, which pressures exporters\u2019 margins and takes some shine off the DAX. This currency tug-of-war is why DAX traders constantly watch EUR/USD next to the index chart. When the Euro dips and global risk sentiment is positive, DAX bulls often get a boost. When the Euro rallies hard while growth data disappoints, DAX gains can fade quickly.\nRight now, the narrative is that the ECB is gradually shifting from a pure inflation-fighting stance toward a more growth-sensitive posture. Markets are starting to price in the idea that future policy could turn more supportive for equities, but that path is fragile: one surprise inflation print and the story gets rewritten overnight. That uncertainty is exactly what keeps risk high but also creates opportunity for active traders.\n2. Sector Check: Old Economy Pain vs. New Economy Strength\nThe DAX 40 is not just one index; it is a battlefield between struggling old-economy champions and resilient, sometimes booming, quality growth names.\nGerman Autos: From National Pride to Stress Test\nVolkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are facing a historic reset.

Since 2005, the 'trading-notes' market letter has delivered reliable trading recommendations \u2013 three times a week, directly to your inbox. 100% free. 100% expert knowledge.

Not a boring sideways grind, not a euphoric melt?up \u2013 more like a nervous, choppy phase where every ECB headline and every macro number hits price action like a hammer. German bulls are trying to push back after recent weakness, but bears are still active at the upper zones, defending resistance and forcing sharp intraday reversals.\nVolatility is elevated, fake breakouts are everywhere, and both dip?buyers and late shorts are getting punished if they are even slightly too slow. This is classic transition?phase price action: the market is deciding whether this is a topping distribution or a deeper?than?expected accumulation before the next big leg.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Swipe through viral DAX trading setups on TikTok\nThe Story: The DAX 40 is not trading in a vacuum \u2013 it is basically a live chart of Europe\u2019s biggest macro contradictions.\n1. ECB policy: Lagarde\u2019s tightrope walk\nThe European Central Bank, under Christine Lagarde, is stuck between a fragile economy and the ghost of sticky inflation. Rates were hiked aggressively in the last cycle, and now the debate is: cut too fast and risk another inflation flare?up, or cut too slow and crush growth completely?\nFor DAX traders, it boils down to one thing: liquidity and discount rates. When the market thinks the ECB will stay cautious and keep rates relatively high, German cyclicals, banks, and industrials tend to wobble. Higher yields pressure valuations and increase recession fears. When the narrative flips toward more dovish guidance \u2013 even just in the language of press conferences \u2013 growth names and high?beta DAX components can suddenly squeeze higher as algo flows turn risk?on.\nRight now the tone is mixed. The ECB is signaling patience, but not full?on panic about growth yet. That uncertainty keeps the DAX in a nervous band, where every ECB speech, every hint about future cuts or balance sheet policies, triggers short?term mini?trends. Traders are front?running the next move, institutions are rotating more slowly, and that clash shows directly in the choppy intraday moves.\n2. EUR/USD \u2013 the hidden DAX driver\nGlobal traders often underestimate how strongly the euro exchange rate feeds back into the DAX.\n- A weaker euro tends to help big DAX exporters \u2013 think autos, machinery, chemicals \u2013 because their products become more competitive outside the eurozone and foreign revenues translate into more euros.\n- A stronger euro can be a headwind for those same exporters, compressing margins and weakening earnings guidance in global terms.\nLately, EUR/USD has been driven by the tug?of?war between the ECB and the Fed: who cuts first, who blinks harder. When the Fed sounds more dovish than the ECB, the euro can strengthen, tempering some of the DAX\u2019s upside. When the ECB looks more worried about growth or more open to cuts, the euro can soften, cushioning the blow for German exporters even if domestic data looks gloomy.\nSo if you are trading the DAX without at least glancing at EUR/USD, you are basically playing poker without seeing half the cards on the table.\n3. Earnings season: guidance matters more than headline beats\nIn the current macro regime, the DAX doesn\u2019t move just on whether a company beats expectations \u2013 it moves on what management says about the next 6\u201312 months. Strong results with cautious guidance can trigger sell?offs. Slight misses with surprisingly optimistic 2025 outlook"

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.6% as Big Tech titans Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOG) lost ground.\n(^DJI)\nDecember retail sales remained \"virtually unchanged\" from the month prior. The flatlining sales data signals a slowdown in spending through the end of the holiday season from November's month-on-month growth of 0.6%, and it fell well below economist expectations.\nThe weak number appeared to lead to an increase in bets on interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. While most traders still expect the Fed to hold steady next month and April, those majorities are shrinking. Meanwhile, over 75% of traders now expect rates to be lower by June.\nThe consumer data lays the ground for Wednesday's all-important January jobs report, in high focus following last week's signs of softening in the labor market. The latest Consumer Price Index reading is then due on Friday to give a look at inflation pressures, as the Fed continues to balance both sides of its dual mandate\nIn the corporate world, wealth management stocks took a hit on Tuesday after an AI startup unveiled a tool that raised concerns about potential disruption in the industry, echoing recent fears seen in the software sector. Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW), Raymond James Financial (RJF), and LPL Financial (LPLA) all sold off more than 6%.\nElsewhere, investors combed through the latest batch of quarterly earnings, Coca-Cola (KO) and CVS Health (CVS) among them. Ford (F) is a highlight on Tuesday's docket after the market close.\nGold (GC=F) and bitcoin (BTC-USD) are still on investors\u2019 radar, as the assets try to stabilize after last week\u2019s sharp pullback. After rallying above $5,000 to start the week, gold slipped back slightly early Tuesday, though strategists remain bullish on its prospects this year. But a risk-off mood weighed on bitcoin, which resumed its slide to trade near $69,000. The leading cryptocurrency has seen heavy volatility, driven by what one analyst called a \"crisis of confidence.\"\nLIVE 20 updates"

                "body": "S&P 500, Nasdaq dip with economic data, earnings in focus\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested disappointing retail sales figures and waited for a key labor market report. The S&P 500 communication services sector was weighed down by Alphabet shares after Google's parent said it sold bonds worth $20 billion.\nThe announcement came as investors have been worrying about the amount of money technology companies say they must spend to support the artificial-intelligence boom, with Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft collectively set to spend hundreds of billions in 2026 as they race for AI dominance. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly stalled in December as households scaled back spending on vehicles and other big-ticket items, suggesting a slower growth path for consumer spending and the economy heading into the new year. The flat reading compared with economists' estimates for 0.4% growth. Trader hopes edged up for a more dovish Federal Reserve with the probability of a one-notch April rate cut up to 36% from 32.2% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Markets still expect, however, that the central bank will keep rates on hold until June, when President Donald Trump's Fed chair nominee, Kevin Warsh, would take charge if approved by the U.S. Senate.\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, described the disappointing retail data as \"bad news is good news,\" particularly for rate-sensitive industry indexes such as utilities and real estate , which were leading the benchmark's sector gainers.\nBut the strategist pointed to caution ahead of the delayed but closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, due on Wednesday.\n\"In anticipation of the jobs report, nobody wants to get too far above their risk budget in the event the number does cause some consternation,\" said Luschini. Potentially adding some angst was White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett's comment on Monday that U.S. job gains could be lower in the coming months because of slower labor force growth and higher productivity due to AI gains.\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 23.49 points, or 0.34%, to end at 6,941.33 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 139.49 points, or 0.60%, to 23,099.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.15 points, or 0.08%, to 50,179.02.\nWith the S&P 500 narrowly missing a return to its late January record close on Monday, Janney's Luschini said: \"When a security or an index reapproaches a high level again there's often some hesitation, some contention that has to take place before it can break through that peak again.\" Gains in stocks such as Walt Disney and Home Depot helped push the blue-chip Dow up modestly to a fresh peak, against a drag from Coca-Cola, which lost ground after missing Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue.\nIn other individual stocks, Datadog jumped after the cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform beat quarterly estimates. In the consumer discretionary sector, Marriott rallied after hitting a record high. The hotel chain projected a 35% jump in fees from co-branded credit cards, as affluent travelers splurge on luxury vacations. Shares of S&P Global dipped after forecasting 2026 profit below analysts' estimates. Peers Moody's and MSCI also fell during the session. Spotify shares soared after the audio-streaming platform forecast first-quarter earnings above expectations, benefiting from strong user growth and price hikes.\n___\nReporting by Twesha Dikshit and Purvi Agarwal in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Pooja Desai"

                "body": "Used Tesla Model S sees a major price drop in 2026\nThis used Tesla has faced extreme depreciation in recent years, creating buying opportunities.\n- Tesla may be discontinuing the Model S, but it remains available on the used car market.\n- While a new Model S starts at nearly $95,000, used models can be found for under $18,000.\nTesla may be discontinuing the Model S to make room for Optimus bot production, but drivers will still be able to purchase the electric vehicle at steeply discounted prices compared to its original MSRP as a used car.\nThe Model S was originally introduced in 2012 as one of the first mainstream electric modern luxury sedans from an American automaker. Its popularity has fluctuated since its debut, but the Model S remains an important part of the clean energy and electric vehicle company's history.\nTesla's Model S is extremely performance-oriented. Luckily for drivers, there are several used models listed for affordable prices.\nHow much is a used Tesla Model S electric car?\nA brand-new Tesla Model S electric car starts at a whopping $94,990. Used Tesla Model S EVs can be found for under $18,000, depending on the model year and the used car buying platform.\nThere are several Model S EVs listed on Carvana for under $18,000. Those models were originally priced around $70K as new EVs. That's a depreciation rate of over 74%.\nThe most affordable 2014 Tesla Model S EV on Carvana starts at $17,590 before taxes and additional fees. It produces 302 horsepower and originally had 208 miles of driving range, though its range will be significantly lower due to battery degradation over time.\nCarMax also has several newer used Model S EVs listed on its site starting at $34,998 for a 2021 Long Range Plus model. Drivers who are interested in the nameplate can find plenty of older and newer used models that are much more affordable than the average new vehicle price of around $50,000.\nWhat's so special about the Tesla Model S?\nThe Model S is special because it's one of the first electric cars to prove that EVs can be engaging and practical enough to function as a daily driver sports car. It paved the way for many vehicles in its segment and is one of the most impressive electric cars on the market despite how many rivals have been created over the years.\nEven older Model S EVs boast performance that's thrilling. Thanks to depreciation, drivers can experience what was once one of the most expensive EVs by leaps and bounds at a fraction of its original price.\nShould you get a used Tesla Model S?\nElectric vehicle ownership isn't for everyone. It requires a solid charging plan if you're going to use an EV as your daily driver for commuting and traveling long distances regularly. The Model S has plenty of appeal as a used electric vehicle, but battery degradation is a huge factor to consider when it comes to practicality.\nA used Model S electric vehicle can be a good choice for drivers with home charging or drivers willing to purchase and install a home charging system for their car, so range won't be a huge issue. It's also a good pick for Tesla fans interested in quick acceleration and stellar performance."

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s takeover of the Department of Health and Human Services, is America actually healthier? The secretary seems to think so, and he gives all the credit to Donald Trump for letting him execute his quack \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joy to work for him,\u201d he said of the president while speaking Monday at a Heritage Foundation event to commemorate the year since the Senate confirmed him to lead the nation\u2019s health systems. \u201cHe lets me do stuff that I don\u2019t think anyone else would let me do.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s HHS, like the rest of Trump\u2019s government, has centered its mission around the obsessions of the hyper online, conspiracy-minded right, while largely rejecting established science. Outside of the social media posts and RFK workout videos, the first year of MAHA has brought potentially catastrophic damage to the nation\u2019s health infrastructure.\nThe administration disagrees, of course. \u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, HHS is exercising its full authority to deliver results for the American people. In his first year, the department confronted long-standing public health challenges with transparency, courage, and gold-standard science,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement provided to Rolling Stone, adding that HHS will continue to \u201cprotect public health\u201d in 2026.\nLet\u2019s rewind to take a look at the department\u2019s approach to the public\u2019s health over the past year.\nGutting the nation\u2019s health systems\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, along with virtually every other government agency, was the subject of severe staffing cuts after Trump retook office. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the National Institute of Health (NIH) \u2014 both of which were targets of criticisms and conspiracies related to the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 lost thousands of employees. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health was also stripped of staff and programs (the laid-off workers were reinstated in January amid backlash from labor unions and other advocates).\nKennedy has also made a point of systemically removing researchers and experts. Kennedy for example fired the more than a dozen experts who comprised the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that helped determine annual vaccine recommendations and coordinate national vaccine campaigns with insurers and providers. The independent panel\u2019s members were replaced with a slew of vaccine skeptics. Kennedy ousted critical figures in the leadership of HHS and its subsidiary organizations, including former CDC Director Susan Monarez, who left the organization after being pressured by Kennedy to approve unscientific vaccine guidelines.\nThe first year of Kennedy\u2019s tenure also featured funding cuts to a slew of programs and agencies \u2014 in some cases through fiscal hatchet jobs that drew enough public outrage to force a reversal. Cancer research, childhood health care funding, and addiction resources and treatment were hit, as were grants and funding to university research programs across the country.\nEarlier this month, Congress rejected another round of $33 billion proposed financial cuts to HHS. It seems even Republicans agree enough damage has already been done.\nMaking vaccine skepticism government policy\nKennedy built much of his profile in the \u201calternative\u201d health space on the back of vaccine conspiracy theories, and his commitment to undermining decades of proven science has been central to his first year at the helm of HHS.\nKennedy has delivered on his promises to codify vaccine skepticism into the nation\u2019s health care policies, purging vaccine advisory committees of qualified experts and researchers, and replacing them with anti-vaccine influencers. The secretary canceled annual CDC-funded advertisements promoting the flu vaccine, and instructed the CDC to insert language on its website falsely claiming that there was no evide"

                "body": "TOKYO (Kyodo) -- The Japanese yen briefly rose to the mid-153 zone against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, as long-term U.S. Treasury yields fell overnight, fanning speculation that the interest rate gap between the two countries will narrow.\nJapanese markets are closed Wednesday for the National Foundation Day holiday. At 3 p.m. in Sydney, the dollar fetched 153.54-153.59 yen compared with 154.34-44 yen in New York and 155.56-58 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Tuesday.\nIn New York on Tuesday, sluggish U.S. retail sales data for December fueled expectations that economic growth could decelerate and the Federal Reserve might deliver additional rate cuts, driving long-term Treasury yields lower, dealers said.\nA Japanese bank source said concerns over possible government currency intervention to stem the yen's depreciation persist, adding that profit-taking and position adjustments also emerged amid thin trading in financial markets.\nOn Tuesday, meanwhile, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled tolerance for a weaker dollar, describing the current level as more natural and arguing that it was supporting exports and economic growth."

                "body": "Key takeaways\n- Bullish momentum reinforced by politics: The Nikkei 225 extended its rally from the 6 February reversal low, supported by PM Takaichi\u2019s snap election victory and a decisive parliamentary supermajority, making it the top-performing major global index over the past two sessions (+2.3%).\n- Stronger yen not derailing equities: Despite USD/JPY falling on intervention fears, Japanese equities held firm. Domestically focused stocks are outperforming exporters, suggesting a stronger JPY is boosting consumer confidence and supporting internal demand.\n- Acceleration phase intact toward 60,000: Technically, the short-term uptrend remains valid above 56,990 support, with upside targets at 58,932, 59,884, and 60,833\u201361,215. Momentum indicators continue to support further gains unless key support breaks.\nThe Nikkei 225 has continued to bask in the bullish limelight since last Friday, 6 February 2026\u2019s minor bullish reversal low of 52,956, reinforced by the results of Japan\u2019s lower house parliament snap election held on Sunday, 8 February 2026.\nIncumbent Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s coalition party has managed to score a stunning victory in the snap election, surpassing the two-thirds majority of 310 seats, with Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party winning 316 seats in the 465-seat lower house.\nNikkei 225 is the top performer among global stock markets over the past two days\nFig. 1: Global stock market indices with USD/JPY from 9 Feb to 10 Feb 2026 (Source: MacroMicro)\nSince the start of the week till Tuesday, 10 February 2026, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 is the top-performing major global stock with a positive return of 2.3%, surpassing the major US stock indices; Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%), S&P 500 (-0.3%), Russell 2000 (-0.4%), and Nasdaq 100 (-0.6%) (see Fig. 1).\nInterestingly, the renewed strength in the Japanese yen, where the USD/JPY shed -1% in the past two sessions due to fears of US-Japan joint intervention, is not having a negative feedback loop impact on the Nikkei 225.\nJapan\u2019s equities with high domestic exposure are outperforming exporters\nFig. 2: Relative performance of Nikkei 225 Domestic Exposure against Global Exposure as of 10 Feb 2026 (Source: MacroMicro)\nA stronger JPY is likely to negate the current higher cost-of-living squeeze in Japan, in turn, further boosting consumer confidence, which leads to an increase in domestic spending.\nWithin the Nikkei 225, stocks with a higher reliance on domestic Japanese sales are outperforming export-heavy names, particularly technology equipment and automobile manufacturers with greater overseas exposure.\nSince 4 February 2026, the Nikkei 225 Domestic Exposure 50 Index (domestic sales) has outperformed the Nikkei 225 Global Exposure 50 Index (international sales), where its ratio increased to 0.76 on Tuesday, 10 February 2026, and broke above a 5-month descending resistance (see Fig. 2).\nHence, this counterintuitive observation suggests that a stronger Japanese yen is likely to be playing a supportive role at this juncture to maintain the bullish trend in the Japanese stock market (Nikkei 225).\nLet's now look at the technical chart of Japan CFD index (a proxy of the Nikkei 225 futures) to decipher its short-term trajectory and key levels to watch.\nShort-term trend (1 to 3 days): Minor bullish acceleration intact since 6 February\nFig. 3: Japan 225 CFD index minor trend as of 11 Feb 2026 (Source: TradingView)\nWatch the 56,990 short-term pivotal support on the Japan 225 CFD index for the next intermediate resistances to come in at 58,932, 59,884, and 60.833/61,215 (Fibonacci extensions clusters).\nOn the flip side, a break and an hourly close below 56,990 negates the bullish tone for a minor corrective pull-back towards the next intermediate support at 56,096, and below it risks a deeper slide to retest 55,111/54,790 (the former range resistance from 14 January to 4 February 2026).\nKey elements to support the short-term bullish bias\nThe hourly RSI momentum indicator"

                "body": "TOKYO - The Nikkei stock index ended at a record high Tuesday for the second straight day, surging over 2 percent on hopes for expansionary fiscal policies after Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party scored a landslide victory in Sunday's general election.\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 1,286.60 points, or 2.28 percent, from Monday at 57,650.54. The broader Topix index finished 71.71 points, or 1.90 percent, higher at 3,855.28, also registering an all-time closing high.\nOn the top-tier Prime Market, the main gainers were nonferrous metal, consumer credit and real estate issues.\nThe U.S. dollar mostly traded in the lower 155 yen level in Tokyo as investors sold the U.S. currency on a report that Chinese regulators have advised financial institutions to rein in their holdings of U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 155.56-58 yen compared with 155.82-92 yen in New York and 156.58-61 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Monday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1907-1909 and 185.23-27 yen against $1.1910-1920 and 185.73-83 yen in New York and $1.1855-1857 and 185.64-68 yen in Tokyo late Monday afternoon.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond ended down 0.055 percentage point from Monday's close at 2.235 percent, as the debt was bought on speculation that the Bank of Japan will not raise interest rates while the yen is strengthening.\nThe stock market maintained upward momentum, with the Nikkei index briefly adding nearly 1,600 points, on the back of expectations for stimulus measures under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi after she expressed her eagerness Monday to promote \"responsible yet aggressive\" fiscal policies.\n\"It is more about investor sentiment, rather than economic fundamentals,\" said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, referring to buying driven by fears of missing out on potential gains.\nShares of companies that released favorable earnings or upwardly revised forecasts lifted the market, with nonferrous metal maker Furukawa Electric surging 22.9 percent to 21,500 yen after reporting upbeat results the previous day.\nHeavyweight semiconductor and other technology shares also attracted buying following advances by their U.S. counterparts overnight amid expectations for further growth in the artificial intelligence sector."
