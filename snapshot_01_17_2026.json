                "body": "The global monetary landscape has fundamentally shifted as central banks worldwide embrace unprecedented accommodation strategies. This transformation extends far beyond traditional interest rate adjustments, encompassing comprehensive policy frameworks that systematically reduce opportunity costs for non-yielding assets while simultaneously generating persistent currency devaluation pressures. Financial markets increasingly recognise these developments as structural rather than cyclical, fundamentally altering how institutional investors approach gold price forecast modelling and portfolio allocation decisions.\nFederal Reserve policies specifically create cascading effects throughout precious metals markets through multiple transmission mechanisms. Real interest rates\u2014calculated as nominal rates minus inflation expectations\u2014have entered negative territory across multiple time horizons, effectively providing direct subsidies for alternative monetary stores. This mathematical relationship between policy rates and gold valuations extends beyond simple correlation, reflecting deeper structural changes in how global capital flows respond to monetary accommodation.\nHow Federal Reserve Rate Dynamics Shape 2026 Gold Trajectories\nInterest rate policy architecture fundamentally determines gold's investment attractiveness through opportunity cost calculations and currency strength implications. Current Fed positioning suggests continued accommodation through 2026, with market participants anticipating additional rate reductions totalling 75-100 basis points across multiple meetings. Furthermore, these expectations create immediate upward pressure on gold valuations while establishing longer-term structural support.\nHistorical analysis reveals that 25 basis point rate reductions typically correlate with 3-5% gold price appreciation within 30 trading days, though this relationship varies significantly based on market expectations and concurrent economic conditions. The mechanism operates through multiple channels simultaneously: reduced opportunity costs make non-yielding assets more attractive, currency devaluation expectations increase, and portfolio rebalancing toward gold as inflation hedge accelerates.\nCurrent Rate Environment Analysis:\n- Fed funds rate positioning at 4.25-4.50% supports continued precious metals demand\n- Market-implied probabilities suggest 67% likelihood of July 2026 rate reduction\n- Real interest rates remain negative 0.75% when adjusted for core inflation expectations\n- Forward guidance indicates policy accommodation through Q4 2026\nCurrency dynamics amplify these rate effects as dollar weakness creates dual benefits for gold investors. The Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index has declined 8.3% since early 2025, reflecting both relative monetary policy positioning and structural fiscal concerns. Consequently, this currency weakness translates directly into gold price appreciation for dollar-denominated investors while simultaneously reducing gold costs for international purchasers.\nCentral Bank Reserve Accumulation Patterns Transform Market Structure\nGlobal central banks continue implementing strategic reserve diversification programmes that systematically increase gold allocations regardless of price levels. Current institutional demand exceeds 850 tonnes quarterly, representing a fundamental shift from episodic purchasing toward sustained, strategic accumulation. This transformation reflects broader concerns about currency concentration risks and geopolitical asset freezing precedents.\nInstitutional Demand Breakdown:\nReserve diversification strategies extend beyond simple portfolio optimisation, incorporating strategic considerations about monetary system evolution and geopolitical risk management. Central banks increasingly view gold purchases as essential infrastructure for maintaining monetary policy independence, particularly as international sanctions risks expand and currency weaponisation concerns intensify."

These uncertainties keep investors focused on precious metals as risk-hedging assets. Analysts expect that gold and silver prices will remain volatile this week, mainly influenced by fluctuations in the US Dollar Index. Meanwhile, the market is also awaiting a major ruling by the US Supreme Court on a tariff case, which could further impact the price trends of precious metals."

However, this rally is facing a practical constraint: industries that use this white metal may have started to reduce purchases; \u2461Saxo Bank strategists noted that every rally eventually reaches its limit, and for silver, the most likely factor to halt its rise is the contraction of industrial demand.\nCailian Press, January 17 (edited by Bian Chun) \u2014 In the recent sharp rally of precious metals, silver has significantly outperformed gold. However, this rally is facing a practical constraint: industries that use this white metal may have started to reduce purchases.\nOle Hansen, head of Saxo Bank's commodity strategy, recently wrote: \u201cWhen the price of silver rises to a certain level, manufacturers and end users simply cannot bear the higher costs.\u201d\nSilver\u2019s industrial applications include solar panels, electronics, and chips that are crucial to artificial intelligence development.\n\u201cThese companies either attempt to pass on the costs but fail, reduce their procurement volumes, or switch to alternative materials,\u201d Hansen added.\nThis week, spot silver prices hit a record high above $93 per ounce, with gains nearing 26% since the start of 2026. The price of this precious metal surged by about 170% in 2025 alone, far exceeding gold\u2019s increase of 73% during the same period.\nCompared to gold, silver plays a more complex role as it is both a precious metal and a key industrial raw material. This means it benefits from safe-haven demand while also being closely tied to long-term trends such as electrification, solar energy, and electronics.\nThis dual nature makes silver particularly vulnerable to supply shocks. Last year, due to tariff concerns, a large amount of silver flowed into the United States, causing abnormally low inventories in the London market. Subsequent physical silver short squeezes further amplified the price surge.\nWith the current price of silver at approximately $91 per ounce, some industrial users have already begun reacting by either reducing usage or seeking alternatives.\nRecently, China\u2019s leading photovoltaic companies, LONGi Green Energy and JinkoSolar, both announced they would begin using cheaper base metals to partially replace silver.\nNevertheless, Hansen pointed out that the impact of slowing corporate procurement and the consumption of existing inventories may take some time to fully materialize, thereby altering the market's overall view on the silver boom.\n\"Every rally eventually comes to an end, and for silver, the most likely braking factor is the contraction in industrial demand,\" said Hansen.\nSilver prices have retreated over the past few days after President Trump announced earlier this week that he would temporarily not impose tariffs on critical minerals and instructed negotiations with trading partners regarding key mineral issues.\nData released by the U.S. government on Friday showed that hedge funds and other large speculative institutions cut their net long positions in silver by 15% to 15,045 contracts in the week ending January 13, marking the lowest level in more than 22 months."

They offered goodwill exchanges of outgrown clothes and spare toys.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nBut with time, they have turned into urgent pleas for milk, cooking oil, medicine and other essentials.\nToday, they map the depth of a cost-of-living crisis tightening its grip across the West Bank.\nThe territory is sliding into a hunger crisis, says economy researcher Dr Haitham Oweida.\nHunger, by international definitions, does not mean total deprivation. It means the inability to secure enough nutritious food consistently - a condition now visibly taking hold across the West Bank, according to Oweida.\nThe crisis, though less stark than in Gaza, is felt daily, as economic conditions across the West Bank rapidly deteriorate.\nEconomic collapse\nSince October 2023, Israeli restrictions on livelihoods and resources across the West Bank have pushed an already fragile economy towards collapse, turning everyday survival into a struggle.\nPoverty rates have risen to around 28 percent of the population. There has been an unprecedented decline in the ability of social protection programmes to meet growing needs.\nBefore the war, the Palestinian economy rested on three main pillars.\nThe first was Palestinian labour in Israel. Between 250,000 and 300,000 workers, with and without permits, injected around $460m a month - more than $5.5bn a year - into the economy.\nMost workers have been banned from entering Israel since the war broke out in October 2023.\nThe second was domestic tourism by Palestinian citizens of Israel, which sustained trade and services across the West Bank and generated a similar $460m per month.\nThe third was clearance revenues - taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA) - which brought in between $260m and $310m monthly.\nAfter the war began, most of these flows dried up. International aid to the PA also declined and became increasingly unstable, falling in 2025 to an estimated $710m-$770m a year.\nThe affect has been immediate. The PA has struggled to pay full salaries to public-sector employees, even as security conditions deteriorated.\nMeanwhile, Israeli closures have intensified. Military checkpoints have increased to around 898, alongside some 300 military gates, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). This has left trade and internal movement largely paralysed.\nUnlike previous economic crises, the fallout has not been confined to the poorest. It has cut across all layers of society.\n\u201cWhat is happening in the West Bank is voluntary economic displacement,\u201d Dr Oweida told Middle East Eye.\n'We have reached a stage where Palestinians - whether traders, public employees or labourers - can no longer continue'\n- Dr Haitham Oweida, economy researcher\n\u201cWe have reached a stage where Palestinians - whether traders, public employees or labourers - can no longer continue.\u201d\nAccording to the 2025 report by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and the Palestinian Monetary Authority, unemployment in the West Bank has reached around 28 percent.\nGDP has fallen by 13 percent compared with 2023."

                "body": "Oil prices have traded modestly higher over the past week, but renewed unrest in Iran has drawn attention back to geopolitical risks that could quickly disrupt global energy flows. Investors are closely watching the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for oil and natural gas shipments, as tensions escalate.\nBNN Bloomberg spoke with Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Tortoise Capital, about why geopolitical risk remains largely absent from oil prices, how supply disruptions could change that quickly, and where crude prices may head over the longer term.\nKey Takeaways\n- Geopolitical risk remains largely unpriced in oil despite rising tensions in Iran and other producing regions.\n- Any disruption to the Strait of Hormuz could have an outsized impact, as roughly 20 per cent of global oil and LNG flows pass through the waterway.\n- A full and prolonged closure of the Strait is considered unlikely due to Iran\u2019s reliance on oil exports and international security presence.\n- Short-term supply disruptions or rising geopolitical anxiety could still push oil prices several dollars higher.\n- Over the longer term, reduced U.S. production and stronger demand could gradually lift oil prices toward the low US$70 range.\nRead the full transcript below:\nANDREW: Let\u2019s take a look at a one-week chart for oil and see how crude in North America has fared. As of today, it\u2019s up about one per cent \u2014 not a massive move, but you can see that modest gain over the past week. There was a spike earlier amid fears, among other things, that the United States might launch an attack on Iran following the killing of protesters.\nLet\u2019s get more from Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Tortoise Capital. Thanks very much for joining us. It\u2019s interesting that we have two geopolitical stories simmering right now \u2014 Venezuela and Iran.\nROB: You\u2019re right, Andrew. There are two, but there\u2019s probably close to zero geopolitical risk embedded in crude oil prices at the present time. From our perspective, that creates the potential for oil prices to rise simply because these geopolitical concerns seem to be increasing almost daily.\nANDREW: That\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ve heard for quite a while that the oil market seems remarkably calm about geopolitical risk. You don\u2019t think even a modest risk premium is creeping into crude right now?\nROB: Maybe a very mild one, but not much. If you think about what could happen, it really comes down to geography \u2014 particularly with Iran and the Strait of Hormuz. As many viewers know, the Strait of Hormuz is critically important to global energy transportation, especially oil. Tens of millions of barrels per day move through the strait.\nIf Iran were somehow to temporarily block or disrupt that passage, it would wreak havoc on the global oil market by reducing supply, at least in the short term. Obviously, there are many interested parties \u2014 including the U.S., China and others \u2014 that want to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. But the reality is that the Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important transit points for energy commodities in the world.\nANDREW: I\u2019ve heard it said this week that such a move would be a desperate one for the regime in Tehran \u2014 something it might only consider if it felt backed into a corner.\nROB: I agree. It would be a last-ditch effort, but it would cause oil prices to rise substantially. A more realistic scenario is the gradual addition of geopolitical risk to oil prices. I think you could see prices move up by a few dollars as tensions continue to rise.\nIf things were to calm down, fundamentals would still dominate. The global oil market remains oversupplied, which is why prices fell last year. Until there\u2019s an adjustment in supply or stronger demand, oil prices will largely move with perceptions of geopolitical risk.\nANDREW: Where do you see oil heading over the next year? I know that\u2019s almost impossible to answer given all the variables, but do you see crude edging h"

While the threat of an immediate intervention from the US against Iran has subsided, the US is moving an aircraft carrier strike group into the Middle East, and other military assets are expected to be shifted there in the coming days and weeks, according to Fox News.\nUnrest in Iran, OPEC's fourth-largest producer, is underpinning crude prices as thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in many cities of Iran to protest government policies that have triggered a currency crisis and economic collapse. Iranian security forces have killed thousands of protesters, and President Trump said he may attack Iran if the government continues to kill protesters. Reuters reported on Wednesday that some US personnel have been advised to leave the US Al Udeid Air base in Qatar. The facility was targeted by Iran in retaliatory airstrikes last year after the US attacked Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran, OPEC's fourth-largest producer, produces more than 3 million bpd, and its crude production could be disrupted if the protests against the government worsen and the US decides to strike government targets.\nCrude is also finding support after drone attacks on oil tankers near the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal on Russia's Black Sea Coast have reduced crude loadings at the terminal by almost half to around 900,000 bpd.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell -0.3% w/w to 120.9 million bbl in the week ended January 9.\nStrength in Chinese crude demand is supportive for prices. According to Kpler data, China's crude imports in December are set to increase by 10% m/m to a record 12.2 million bpd as it rebuilds its crude inventories.\nCrude garnered support after OPEC+ on January 3 said it would stick to its plan to pause production increases in Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2025 meeting announced that members would raise production by +137,000 bpd in December, but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's December crude production rose by +40,000 bpd to 29.03 million bpd.\nUkrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past four months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies. Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports.\nLast month, the IEA projected that the world crude surplus will widen to a record 3.815 million bpd in 2026 from a 4-year high of over 2.0 million bpd in 2025.\nOn Tuesday, the EIA raised its 2026 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month, and cut its US 2026 energy consumption estimate to 95.37 (quadrillion btu) from 95.68 last month.\nWednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of January 9"

A big chunk of the decline came from Reliance Industries\u2019 suspension of purchases from sanctioned Rosneft, with which the Indian company has a long-term supply deal.\nEven so, on an individual basis, Russia remained the largest supplier of crude oil to India, followed by Iraq at number two and Saudi Arabia at number three in December, as Indian state-owned oil companies switched to buying crude from non-sanctioned Russian companies.\nRussian oil flows to India are likely to remain relatively strong, at between 1.2 million barrels daily and 1.4 million barrels daily, Kpler analyst Sumit Ritola said, as quoted by Reuters.\nOver 2025, per the data, the share of OPEC crude in Indian imports ticked up from 49% a year earlier to 50%, while Russia\u2019s share declined from 36% in 2024 to 33%.\nEarlier this week, Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air reported that Russian oil flows to India had dropped by 29% on the month in December, while exports to China went up by 23% on November. Oil exports to China in December drove an 11% increase in total Russian exports, CREA noted in its report, even as shipments to India fell to the lowest since the G7 imposition of a price cap on Russian oil shipments insured at Western companies. The decline, however, was a lot more modest than a Bloomebrg prediction that Russian flows to India could slump to just 800,000 barrels daily in December because of the new sanctions.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

                "body": "Oil prices have traded modestly higher over the past week, but renewed unrest in Iran has drawn attention back to geopolitical risks that could quickly disrupt global energy flows. Investors are closely watching the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for oil and natural gas shipments, as tensions escalate.\nBNN Bloomberg spoke with Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Tortoise Capital, about why geopolitical risk remains largely absent from oil prices, how supply disruptions could change that quickly, and where crude prices may head over the longer term.\nKey Takeaways\n- Geopolitical risk remains largely unpriced in oil despite rising tensions in Iran and other producing regions.\n- Any disruption to the Strait of Hormuz could have an outsized impact, as roughly 20 per cent of global oil and LNG flows pass through the waterway.\n- A full and prolonged closure of the Strait is considered unlikely due to Iran\u2019s reliance on oil exports and international security presence.\n- Short-term supply disruptions or rising geopolitical anxiety could still push oil prices several dollars higher.\n- Over the longer term, reduced U.S. production and stronger demand could gradually lift oil prices toward the low US$70 range.\nRead the full transcript below:\nANDREW: Let\u2019s take a look at a one-week chart for oil and see how crude in North America has fared. As of today, it\u2019s up about one per cent \u2014 not a massive move, but you can see that modest gain over the past week. There was a spike earlier amid fears, among other things, that the United States might launch an attack on Iran following the killing of protesters.\nLet\u2019s get more from Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Tortoise Capital. Thanks very much for joining us. It\u2019s interesting that we have two geopolitical stories simmering right now \u2014 Venezuela and Iran.\nROB: You\u2019re right, Andrew. There are two, but there\u2019s probably close to zero geopolitical risk embedded in crude oil prices at the present time. From our perspective, that creates the potential for oil prices to rise simply because these geopolitical concerns seem to be increasing almost daily.\nANDREW: That\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ve heard for quite a while that the oil market seems remarkably calm about geopolitical risk. You don\u2019t think even a modest risk premium is creeping into crude right now?\nROB: Maybe a very mild one, but not much. If you think about what could happen, it really comes down to geography \u2014 particularly with Iran and the Strait of Hormuz. As many viewers know, the Strait of Hormuz is critically important to global energy transportation, especially oil. Tens of millions of barrels per day move through the strait.\nIf Iran were somehow to temporarily block or disrupt that passage, it would wreak havoc on the global oil market by reducing supply, at least in the short term. Obviously, there are many interested parties \u2014 including the U.S., China and others \u2014 that want to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. But the reality is that the Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important transit points for energy commodities in the world.\nANDREW: I\u2019ve heard it said this week that such a move would be a desperate one for the regime in Tehran \u2014 something it might only consider if it felt backed into a corner.\nROB: I agree. It would be a last-ditch effort, but it would cause oil prices to rise substantially. A more realistic scenario is the gradual addition of geopolitical risk to oil prices. I think you could see prices move up by a few dollars as tensions continue to rise.\nIf things were to calm down, fundamentals would still dominate. The global oil market remains oversupplied, which is why prices fell last year. Until there\u2019s an adjustment in supply or stronger demand, oil prices will largely move with perceptions of geopolitical risk.\nANDREW: Where do you see oil heading over the next year? I know that\u2019s almost impossible to answer given all the variables, but do you see crude edging h"

This trimmed the chances for further easing by the Federal Reserve, a tailwind for the Greenback. The pair trades at 1.1599, down 0.08%.\nEuro edges lower as strong US labor and production data underpin the Dollar despite fading momentum\nThe shared currency is poised to end the week negatively, following solid jobless claims revealed on Thursday. This, a spike on factory inflation and US President Trump reluctancy to nominate Kevin Hassett as Fed Chair, pushed US Treasury yields higher and expectations for further Fed easing lower.\nConsequently, the Dollar recovered ground. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Fed Chair decision would be known before Davos and that Governor Stephen Miran can continue at the central bank past January 31st.\nOn Friday, several Federal Reserve officials crossed the wires, led by the Vice-Chair Philip Jefferson, Governor Michelle Bowman and Boston Fed Susan Collins. Except for Bowman supporting further rate cuts, Jefferson and Collins consider policy to be in a good place.\nData-wise, US Industrial Production rose 0.4% in December, exceeding estimates for a dip to 0.1%, revealed the Federal Reserve.\nIn Europe, the docket remained light with the release of German inflation, which hit the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2% YoY in December.\nEuro Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this week. Euro was the strongest against the Swiss Franc.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Euro dives as inflation recedes\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY) which tracks the American currency performance versus six peers, is up 0.03% at 99.38. US Treasury yields are soaring following the Hassett headline, with the 10-year T-note yield up nearly five basis points at 4.219%.\n- US economic data showed a mixed inflation picture, with consumer prices stabilizing while inflation on the producer-side turned hot. On an annual basis, headline CPI held at 2.7%, virtually unchanged from November, whereas PPI accelerated to 3.0%, up from 2.8% the prior month, highlighting lingering cost pressures upstream.\n- Also, the labor market signaled resilience. Last Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report was solid despite undershooting forecasts, while the Unemployment Rate edged down to 4.4%, below the Fed\u2019s 4.5% projection. Reinforcing that strength, Initial Jobless Claims fell from 207K to 198K, pointing to fewer Americans filing for unemployment benefits.\n- Vice-Chair Jefferson said officials do not want to prejudge January\u2019s decision, added that current policy stance leaves US well positioned to determine how much and when to adjust rates. Governor Bowman argued that the Federal Reserve should not pause its easing cycle, saying that additional rate cuts are warranted in light of rising risks of the jobs market.\n- Meanwhile, Boston Fed President Susan Collins underscored the importance of central bank independence, noting that an effective central bank must remain accountable yet free to make difficult and potentially unpopular decisions in pursuit of its mandate.\n- This week US economic data revealed "

                "body": "The Euro weakens against the US Dollar as positive US data supports the Dollar\u2019s strength. Markets expect the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates, bolstering the Dollar. EUR/USD trades flat near 1.1600 after hitting its lowest since November 28.\nTechnical indicators maintain bearish pressure on EUR/USD, with the pair trading below key moving averages clustered around 1.1660-1.1665. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is still in negative territory, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 34.\nImmediate Support and Resistance\nImmediate support lies in the 1.1585-1.1600 range, while a break below could push it towards 1.1550. Resistance for rebounds is near 1.1660-1.1700.\nThe Euro is the currency for 20 EU countries and is heavily traded. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of foreign exchange transactions. The ECB, located in Frankfurt, sets interest rates to manage monetary policy, with inflation often prompting rate changes.\nEconomic indicators such as GDP and trade balances influence the Euro\u2019s value. A strong economy can boost the Euro by attracting foreign investment and potentially leading to higher interest rates. A positive net trade balance also strengthens the currency.\nWe are seeing a familiar pattern of US Dollar strength capping any attempts by the Euro to rally. The latest US jobs report, showing a robust 250,000 positions added in December 2025, reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve has little reason to cut rates soon. This situation is reminiscent of the pressure we observed throughout much of last year when strong US data kept the dollar elevated.\nTechnical Outlook and Trading Strategies\nThis policy divergence is becoming starker, as recent Eurozone inflation figures for January 2026 came in at 1.8%, below the ECB\u2019s target. This soft reading increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank may have to consider easing its policy later this year, putting further downward pressure on the EUR/USD pair. Historically, when the Fed holds steady while the ECB hints at cuts, the dollar almost always outperforms the Euro.\nThe technical picture also supports a bearish outlook, with the pair struggling below the key simple moving averages clustered around 1.1660-1.1700. We saw this zone act as a major ceiling in 2025, and it now appears to be a formidable resistance level again. The momentum indicators, like the MACD and RSI, are pointing to persistent selling pressure, much as they did during previous downturns.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests positioning for further weakness in the coming weeks. Buying put options with strike prices below the 1.1600 support level could be a straightforward way to profit from a continued slide toward the 1.1500 psychological mark. A bear put spread could also be used to lower the upfront cost of the position while defining the risk.\nAny unexpected rallies should be viewed with skepticism and potentially as opportunities to enter bearish positions at better prices. We should watch for the pair becoming oversold, as an RSI near 34 has previously signaled temporary bounces, but the dominant trend remains downward. The strong resistance near 1.1700 makes selling call options or implementing bear call spreads a viable strategy to generate income on the belief that the upside is limited."

This strength was a key reason the dollar began to outperform the pound.\nThat trend has largely continued, as the Fed maintained its cautious stance throughout 2025, supporting the dollar. We see this resilience even now, with the latest jobless claims for the week ending January 9, 2026, holding steady at 210,000. This confirms the labor market remains tight, giving the Fed little reason to rush into cutting interest rates from their current 5.25% level.\nAs a result, the GBP/USD pair has drifted lower over the past year and is currently trading near 1.3150, well below the 1.3380 level seen in January 2025. The interest rate differential between the US and the UK remains a primary driver for currency traders. The narrative of a stronger US economy continues to weigh on the pound.\nUK Economic Pressures\nThe focus is now shifting to the Bank of England, which is facing a different set of economic pressures. With UK inflation having cooled more definitively to 2.5% in the latest report, markets are pricing in a higher probability that the BoE will begin cutting rates before the Fed. This expectation of policy divergence is likely to add further downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair in the coming weeks.\nGiven this outlook, buying put options on GBP/USD offers a straightforward way to position for potential further weakness in the pound. This strategy allows traders to profit if the exchange rate falls below a specific level, while limiting the initial risk to the premium paid for the option. It is a direct play on the theme of a strong dollar and a potentially softer pound.\nConsidering that implied volatility often increases around central bank meetings, a bear put spread could also be an effective strategy. By selling a lower-strike put against the purchased put, traders can reduce the upfront cost of the position. This approach caps potential profits but offers a more capital-efficient way to bet on a moderate decline in GBP/USD."

                "body": "GBP/USD Weekly Forecast: Pound Sterling remains under pressure against US Dollar\n- Pound Sterling declined to a four-week low around 1.3360 against the US Dollar during the week.\n- Criminal charges against Fed\u2019s Powell remained a key event for the US Dollar\u2019s price action.\n- Investors brace for high volatility in the Pound Sterling ahead of a UK data-packed week.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) started off the week on a firm footing against the US Dollar (USD) and jumped to 1.3486 on Monday, following criminal charges against Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell over cost overrun in the reconstruction of Washington\u2019s headquarters.\nHowever, the GBP/USD pair turned down steadily as the week passed after Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Alan Taylor delivered dovish comments on the monetary policy outlook, and investors shifted their focus to the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision scheduled later this month.\nPound Sterling turned upside down\nThe Pound Sterling gained sharply against the US Dollar on Monday after United States (US) federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Powell over mismanaging funds in the reconstruction of Washington\u2019s headquarters.\nIn response, Powell said that the \u201cnew threat is not about the renovation project but a pretext\u201d. He also added that the threat of criminal charges is a \u201cconsequence of the Fed setting interest rates based on its assessment of the public interest rather than the president's preferences\u201d.\nMarket experts viewed the accusation of cost overruns against Powell as an attack on the central bank\u2019s independence, which could undermine US assets and impact the US sovereign rating in the long run.\nIt remained clear from US President Donald Trump\u2019s comments over the past several months that he was unhappy with the Fed not reducing interest rates aggressively, criticizing Chairman Powell several times for the same.\nOn Tuesday, US President Trump criticized Fed\u2019s Powell again after the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December, which showed price pressures rising steadily, demonstrating his dislike for him for not prioritizing his economic agenda. \u201cWe have very low inflation. That would give \u2019too late Powell\u2019 the chance to give us a nice beautiful big rate cut,\" Trump said.\nChiefs from global central banks came in support of Powell, stating that \u201cIndependence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve\u201d, and \u201cwe stand in full solidarity with the Fed System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell.\u201d\nHowever, the steady US CPI report on Tuesday provided relief for the US Dollar against the British currency, as it intensified speculation that the Fed will announce a pause in its ongoing monetary-easing campaign at its policy meeting later this month.\nOn Wednesday, dovish commentary from BoE\u2019s Taylor on the monetary policy outlook dragged the Pound Sterling further against the US Dollar.\nTaylor said in a speech on Wednesday that inflation could return to the central bank\u2019s 2% target in mid-2026 more quickly than having to wait until 2027, and projected that interest rates could \u201cnormalise to neutral sooner rather than later\u201d. In the December policy meeting, the BoE guided that the monetary policy will remain on a \u201cgradual downward path\u201d.\nThe impact of expectations for the Fed holding interest rates steady and BoE Taylor\u2019s dovish commentary was significant for GBP/USD, restraining the pair from regaining ground despite strong United Kingdom (UK) monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for November on Thursday.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the economy returned to growth after contracting 0.1% in both September and October. The GDP growth came in at 0.3%, stronger than estimates of 0.1%. Month-on-month (MoM) Industrial and Manufacturing Production also grew at a robust pace of 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively.\nGBP/USD revisited a four-week low around 1.3360 on late Thursday "

The GBP/USD currency pair faces downward pressure as the US Dollar maintains its strength, supported by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will refrain from further monetary easing at its upcoming policy meeting this month.\nCurrently, the US Dollar Index (DXY)\u2014which measures the Dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of six major currencies\u2014remains elevated, holding near Thursday\u2019s six-week peak of 99.50.\nMarket participants have largely factored in the likelihood that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged within the 3.50%-3.75% range at the January meeting, according to data from the CME FedWatch tool.\nPersistent inflationary pressures in the United States are fueling these expectations. On Thursday, Kansas City Fed Bank President Jeffrey Schmid remarked that monetary policy should remain \u201cmodestly restrictive\u201d as inflation continues to run high.\nMeanwhile, the Pound is expected to remain rangebound as investors await key economic indicators from the United Kingdom, including employment figures and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, both due next week. These reports will be closely watched for insights into the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) future policy direction.\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD is trading at 1.3384, positioned below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3428, which has started to slope downward and is limiting any recovery attempts.\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46, indicating neutral momentum and remaining below the midpoint. The 50% Fibonacci retracement level, calculated from the 1.3793 high to the 1.3009 low, sits at 1.3401 and serves as immediate resistance. A daily close above this level could alleviate some of the bearish sentiment.\nAs long as the pair stays beneath the 20-EMA, the short-term outlook remains negative, with rallies likely to be capped by overhead resistance. Should buyers manage to push the price above the average on a daily closing basis, the next target would be the 61.8% retracement at 1.3494. However, failure to surpass these resistance levels would likely keep the pair in a consolidation phase below key barriers.\n(This technical analysis was generated with assistance from an AI tool.)"

At the time of writing, AUD/USD trades around 0.6684, down about 0.20% on the day and poised to end the week with marginal losses.\nThe pair is struggling to attract buying interest after a run of upbeat US releases reinforced expectations that the Fed is likely to stick to a cautious, gradual easing path, diminishing hopes for near-term rate cuts.\nData released this week showed that US labour-market conditions remain firm. Weekly Initial Jobless Claims fell to 198,000, beating expectations of 215,000, while regional manufacturing surveys also improved, with both the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed indices returning to positive territory.\nInflation data earlier in the week delivered a mixed but still relatively firm signal. Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% MoM in December, matching expectations and keeping the annual rate steady at 2.7%. While core CPI increased 0.2% MoM, coming in below the 0.3% forecast. On a yearly basis, core inflation eased to 2.6%, undershooting expectations of 2.7%.\nMarkets are fully pricing in no change at the upcoming January meeting and broadly expect the Fed to remain on hold through the first quarter. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, June is currently seen as the most likely timing for the first rate cut this year, with probabilities around 46%.\nIn contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely seen as done with its easing cycle, as inflation is still running above target. Expectations are building that the central bank will keep rates on hold throughout much of the year, with some market participants even seeing the next move more likely to be a rate hike.\nLooking ahead, traders will turn their attention to a busy economic calendar next week. In Australia, the TD-MI Inflation Gauge and employment data will be in focus. At the same time, China\u2019s Q4 GDP, December activity data, and the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s interest-rate decision are due, which could be key drivers for the Aussie given Australia\u2019s close trade ties with China.\nIn the United States, traders will also be watching the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (annualized) release and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report for fresh clues on the monetary policy outlook.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance.

This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese e"

                "body": "US Dollar Dynamics\nThe AUD/USD pair holds its ground as the US Dollar sees strength following the Jobless Claims report. US Federal Reserve expectations suggest interest rates will remain on hold, with potential for rate cuts delayed to June. Improved labour market conditions and inflation concerns persist.\nThe Australian Dollar\u2019s value is influenced by RBA interest rates, iron ore prices, and the Chinese economy\u2019s health. Decisions by the RBA, such as interest rate adjustments, influence domestic economic rates. China\u2019s economic condition impacts AUD, as it is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. The price of iron ore and Australia\u2019s Trade Balance also significantly affect the AUD\u2019s strength.\nGiven the AUD/USD is holding near 0.6700, we see a clear divergence forming between the central banks that traders should watch. The market is pricing in a 76% chance of a Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike by May, signaling a hawkish tilt. This presents an opportunity for strategies that benefit from a stronger Australian dollar in the medium term.\nThe case for a stronger Aussie is reinforced by Australia\u2019s recent economic data from late 2025. The Q4 2025 Consumer Price Index from the Australian Bureau of Statistics came in at 4.1%, which was higher than anticipated and well above the RBA\u2019s target. This persistent inflation makes a rate hike from the current 4.35% seem more like a necessity than a choice.\nMarket Opportunities For AUD USD\nOn the other side of the pair, the US dollar\u2019s strength is based on a robust labor market delaying Federal Reserve rate cuts. We saw this in the recent US jobs report from December 2025, which showed a solid 216,000 jobs were added, keeping the Fed on hold for now. However, the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move is still widely expected to be a cut, while the RBA\u2019s is a hike.\nThis fundamental divergence, where one central bank is set to tighten policy and the other is poised to ease, historically creates a strong directional trend. We believe this provides a clear tailwind for the AUD/USD pair through the first half of 2026. Traders should be positioned for a potential grind higher, away from the current 0.6700 level.\nSupporting this view are Australia\u2019s key commodity prices and trade relationships. Iron ore prices have remained robust, trading above $130 per tonne, bolstered by stable demand from China, which reported a steady 5.2% GDP growth for Q4 2025. These external factors provide an additional layer of support for the Australian dollar\u2019s value.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests that buying AUD call options with expirations in the second quarter could be a prudent way to capture the expected upward move. This strategy allows for defined risk while offering significant upside potential if the RBA follows through with a rate hike as the market anticipates. Alternatively, selling out-of-the-money AUD puts could be a way to collect premium based on the view that downside is limited."

Inflation, however, remains above the RBA\u2019s 2% to 3% target for price stability, adding pressure on the RBA to tighten its monetary policy.\nIn the US, recent data supported the view that the US Federal Reserve /Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged, at least in the first quarter of the year.\nThe US Labour Department revealed that Jobless claims declined to their lowest levels since November last week, while manufacturing figures from the New York and Philadelphia regions hinted at a significant improvement in the sector\u2019s business conditions in January.\nSome Fed officials have warned against further rate cuts amid the sticky inflation levels, but the US Central bank is still expected to ease its monetary policy at least once in 2026.

When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is "

With the calendar quiet, political developments, BOJ intervention risk and speculation over who may lead the Federal Reserve are likely to determine direction, while technicals warn of a possible short\u2011term peak.\nJapan Takes the Wheel\nHaving long been driven by interest rate differentials between the United States and Japan along with risk appetite, USD/JPY has undergone something of a changing of the guard when it comes to directional drivers, with domestic\u2011driven factors now playing a far more significant role than in the past. That can be seen in the graphic below tracking the relationship between USD/JPY with a variety of different market variables over the past fortnight (middle pane) and quarter (right\u2011hand pane).\nSource: TradingView\nWith correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.87 respectively across both timeframes, USD/JPY has demonstrated a significant relationship with Japan\u2019s 2s10s curve (the differential between 10\u2011year government bond yields and two\u2011year yields), suggesting speculation over stronger growth and inflation in Japan driven by newly appointed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s reflationary policies, and the debt required to finance them, has played a major role in pushing USD/JPY higher. If inflation is expected to erode the purchasing power of the yen as government bond issuance increases, it makes fundamental sense, especially with Japan\u2019s already world\u2011leading debt levels.\nBut Fed Pricing Still Matters\nFor anyone trading USD/JPY, it is arguably more important to follow Japanese developments rather than those in the United States. However, while the once strong link between longer\u2011dated yield differentials shows little sign of re\u2011establishing itself based on the analysis, the 0.8 correlation with moves in U.S. two\u2011year yields over the past fortnight suggests a continued unwind in market pricing for Fed rate cuts in 2026 may also be contributing to the move higher in USD/JPY this year.\nAs the graphic below reveals, futures are now pricing just 45 basis points of cuts from the Fed, or less than two full 25bp moves. That is substantially less than levels seen in late November, indicating a sizeable hawkish recalibration has taken place.\nSource: TradingView\nHeavy Calendar, Light Impact\nHaving outlined what has been influencing USD/JPY direction, this information can then be used to assess what matters most for USD/JPY in the week ahead. Despite the stacked calendar below, the most important drivers may prove to be political than economic.\nSource: TradingView\nI may be accused of being blunt or complacent, but the known risk events do not screen as being overly risky. In the United States, there will be plenty of data released, but almost all of it is heavily dated due to the impact of the government shutdown last year. It may create some volatility, but the PCE report on Thursday covers November. We are now midway through January. Even when released promptly, markets treat CPI and PPI figures published earlier in the month as far more influential for Fed pricing, even though core PCE is the Fed\u2019s preferred underlying measure. The income and consumption figures may also garner some interest, but do not expect this report to be a game\u2011changer for USD/JPY.\nElsewhere, the final print of Q3 GDP looks like a non\u2011event, as does the run of second\u2011tier releases throughout the week. As more up\u2011to\u2011date measures, jobless claims data on Thursday and the flash PMI report on Friday are worthy of more attention, although they would require a significant surprise relative to consensus to meaningfully impact the dollar.\nIn Japan, the calendar also lacks major risks.

Their concern is that prolonged yen weakness raises import costs and encourages businesses to pass those costs on to consumers. Bear in mind that Japan imports almost 100% of its energy needs and a large portion of other essential materials and goods.\nThe graph below shows that the yen has depreciated by about 35% over the last five years. Moreover, as we will discuss shortly, the yen is now approaching the lows of August 2024.\nThe BOJ is widely expected to hold its policy rate at 0.75% at next week\u2019s meeting, but we expect it to hear more from the bank about the weak yen and its influence on inflation. If currency-driven inflation intensifies and the public continues to pressure politicians over inflation concerns, the yen could force the BOJ to pursue additional rate hikes to strengthen the currency.\nWhy do we care? In August 2024, the S&P 500 fell by slightly over 10% in a matter of days. This was the result of a rapidly strengthening yen. As the yen appreciated, many traders were forced to reverse yen carry trades. Simply put, these traders borrowed cheap money in Japan and invested the money in U.S. stocks and bonds.\nThe economics of the yen carry trade depend on a weak yen. Thus, when we hear the BOJ express concern about a weak yen, we must remember that the yen carry trade can be powerful. This is not a call to action, but we advise monitoring the BOJ and the yen.\nOil Prices Buck The Reflation Narrative\nThere is a growing chorus calling for an economic acceleration and a resulting surge in corporate earnings. They base their forecast on easing financial conditions, including lower rates and QE, fiscal stimulus, and the promise of productivity gains from AI. Equity markets appear to embrace this narrative, as many stock factors and sectors that lagged mega-cap stocks are outperforming the market.\nThis optimism from economists and investors clashes with oil prices. As shown below, crude oil has been in decline for the better part of four years and shows no signs of reversing. Historically, sustained economic acceleration has been accompanied by rising energy demand and higher oil prices as transportation, manufacturing, and industrial activity intensify. The absence of that positive price response suggests that the growth narrative may be more financial than fundamental.\nIn short, weak oil prices are not confirming economic reacceleration; they are quietly warning that headline optimism is running ahead of underlying, energy-intensive activity. A reversal in higher oil prices would improve the prospects of an economic acceleration.\nTweet of the Day\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "Japan and South Korea: Big moves, big opportunity\nHere we arbitrage the recent and projected movements for Japanese and South Korean rates relative to US rates in a cross-currency framework. We find that prior convergence of rates, together with divergence in the respective Asian currencies versus their forwards against the US dollar, presents an opportunity\nWe see Japan and Korea as the inverse to China on rates arbitrage\nLast week, we published an analysis comparing Chinese and US rates, noting that current interest\u2011rate differentials tend to favour China relative to the US. It\u2019s here. When we look at Japan and South Korea, however, the rate environment and currency backdrop are quite different, leading to a contrast with the China-US comparison.\nMin Joo, our Seoul-based economist, sets the scene for both. It's here for Japan, and here for South Korea. On South Korea, the key inputs are an on-hold Bank of Korea (BoK) and KRW weakness (perhaps to 1500 vs USD), ultimately giving way to KRW strength (to 1450 vs USD). And for Japan, key inputs include the Bank of Japan (BoJ) on hold for the first half of 2026 before resuming hikes in the second half, ongoing upward pressure on Japanese market rates, and on USD/JPY, where the 150 area is the next big target to the downside for 2026 (and 145 by the end of 2027). See more on that here; our FX strategist's hot-off-the-press FX Talking publication.\nWe strategise these views, together with an overlay of some notable moves in both markets over the past few weeks. Bottom line: there is a case for short tenor negative carry plays, or taking profit on existing positive carry holdings. Let's take them one at a time.\nNote that \"positive carry\" is where we receive the higher rate and pay the lower rate, and negative carry is the opposite.\nFor Japan, dominating factors remain JPY weakness and rates convergence\nA glance at the chart below shows two big moves. First, a convergence process for spreads. Spreads are still wide, e.g. the 5yr spread is at 194bp, but that's practically half what it was (upper charts). Second, there has been quite a dramatic weakness in the Japanese yen (lower charts). In addition, the cross-currency basis discount on the JPY (which acts to stretch the all-in spread) is well below prior extremes.\nAll of these generate a positive mark-to-market for existing positive carry positions; certainly the ones set nine months ago, but generally in the past two or three years, especially if set with USD/JPY FX rate at below 150. Why? Because the positive carry play is long the all-in spread (benefits if it tightens), and long USD/JPY (benefits if JPY weakens).\nRate spreads from JPY into SOFR\nCharts below show the USD/JPY FX profile\nGiven all of that, there is logic to setting an offsetting negative carry play. That could either knock out an existing positive carry play. Or it could be set outright with a view to benefiting from a very cheap entry point for the JPY, as the negative carry play benefits from JPY appreciation. We think USD/JPY can get back to 150 (and very likely lower). That's a greater JPY appreciation than discounted in the forwards out to 2yrs.\nIf not quite convinced, look at a weakening to 160 for USD/JPY as a trigger point, a level that our FX strategists identify as a likely entry point for Bank of Japan intervention (to strengthen JPY).\nFor players preferring to look to set a positive carry play, then we'd suggest a bias towards longer tenors. In the 10yr, for example, the all-in spread is 226bp. And the breakeven FX rate is 126.\nSo, provided USD/JPY does not appreciate to this level, the spread lock-in dominates, and the play generates all-in positive alpha. We'd view that as a positive reward versus risk. The trade also benefits as Japanese longer-tenor market rates rise (as it tightens the spread to SOFR rates).\nMoreover, should USD/JPY just hold at about here in the long term (say over 5-10 years), then the positive carry is picked up without any FX move"

US December Industrial Production data and insights from US policymakers are anticipated.\nUSD/CAD trades near 1.3900, largely unchanged due to a stronger Canadian Dollar, buoyed by rising oil prices, while the US Dollar holds firm due to robust US data. The Canadian Dollar benefits from increased geopolitical tensions, with Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russian oil tankers raising concerns about global crude oil supply, boosting prices.\nUs Dollar Resilience\nThe US Dollar maintains its strength from solid fundamentals. Resilience in the US labour market and earlier robust retail sales data suggest the Federal Reserve might keep rates steady for some months. Several Federal Reserve officials, including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, advocate for cautious monetary policy.\nRecent US data reinforce these views, with weekly initial jobless claims dipping to 198,000 and manufacturing indices improving. The future direction of USD/CAD will hinge on oil-driven support for the Canadian Dollar versus sustained US economic strength. Percentage changes of the Canadian Dollar against major currencies show it is the strongest against the Australian Dollar.\nAs of January 16, 2026, we see a familiar setup in USD/CAD, echoing the situation from early 2025. The pair is caught between a strong Canadian dollar supported by oil and a resilient US dollar. This tug-of-war suggests the current stability around 1.3650 might not last.\nGeopolitical tensions in the Middle East have once again pushed WTI crude prices above $85 a barrel, a significant jump from the fourth quarter of 2025. This provides strong underlying support for the loonie, just as we saw last year with the attacks in the Baltic Sea. As long as supply concerns persist, the Canadian dollar will likely have a floor.\nTrading Anticipation\nOn the other side, the US economy continues to show surprising strength, with the last CPI report showing inflation remains sticky at 3.4%. Weekly jobless claims are also holding firm near 210,000, reinforcing the narrative that the Federal Reserve will delay any rate cuts. This robust data is keeping the US dollar well-supported.\nFor traders, this creates a scenario where the pair could break out sharply in either direction. This environment is ideal for volatility-based derivative strategies rather than directional bets. We believe purchasing options, like straddles or strangles, could be effective to capitalize on a significant move regardless of its direction.\nAll eyes should now be on the upcoming Bank of Canada interest rate decision on January 24th. Any signal that they are more concerned about economic slowing than the Fed could cause a significant reaction. Traders should be positioned for increased price swings around that announcement.\nCurrently, the options market is reflecting this uncertainty, with one-month implied volatility for USD/CAD trading around 8.5%. This is elevated compared to periods of clear market direction. It indicates that traders are pricing in a greater than usual potential for movement in the coming weeks."

The pair\u2019s hesitation is mainly driven by a stronger Canadian Dollar (CAD), supported by the rebound in Oil prices, while the US Dollar (USD) remains firm in the wake of strong US data sets.\nThe Canadian Dollar finds support from rising geopolitical tensions. According to Reuters, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian oil tankers, with at least six vessels targeted by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. This development has increased concerns over global Crude Oil supply and lifted prices, which generally tends to support the Canadian Dollar. The positive correlation between energy prices and the Canadian currency therefore remains a key driver for the Loonie in the near term.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar continues to draw support from solid fundamentals. Recent signs of resilience in the US labor market, combined with robust Retail Sales data released earlier this week, reinforce the view that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could keep interest rates unchanged for several more months.\nSeveral Fed officials have also adopted a cautious tone. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted that, despite clear evidence of stability in the labor market, the central bank should remain focused on bringing inflation down. At the same time, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that monetary policy is currently \u201cin a good place\u201d to respond to changes in economic conditions.\nRecent US data support this narrative. Weekly Initial Jobless Claims released by the US Department of Labor declined to 198,000 for the week ending January 10, from 207,000 previously, marking the lowest level since November and easing some concerns about labor market deterioration. In the manufacturing sector, the New York Empire State Manufacturing Index rebounded to 7.7 in January after contracting in December, while the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey jumped sharply to 12.6, well above expectations, highlighting a strong start to the year for industrial activity.\nGoing forward, the direction of USD/CAD will likely depend on the balance between Oil-driven support for the Canadian Dollar and the continued strength of US fundamentals, as investors await fresh macroeconomic releases and further guidance from Fed officials.\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today. Canadian Dollar was the strongest against the Australian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "During the Asian trading session on Friday, the US dollar edged lower against the Canadian dollar, trading near 1.3890, as the Canadian dollar was supported by a rebound in oil prices. As one of the world's major energy exporters, Canada benefits significantly from rising oil prices.\nRecently, crude oil prices have been supported by geopolitical risks in the Middle East, benefiting the Canadian dollar and outperforming the US dollar. In terms of geopolitical risks, Ukraine has intensified attacks on Russian tankers in the Baltic Sea, with at least six tankers hit by drones and missiles.\nExpectations of energy supply disruptions have pushed up crude oil prices, while also supporting the performance of the commodity-based Canadian dollar. However, robust US economic data continues to provide resistance to downward momentum for the US dollar. A strong labor market and this week\u2019s retail sales data further reinforce market expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates unchanged in the short term.\nMorgan Stanley analysts have postponed the potential Federal Reserve rate cut window from January and April to June and September, reflecting a robust job market and lingering inflationary pressures.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated, \"With clear evidence of a stable job market, the central bank should focus on reducing inflation.\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said, \"Monetary policy is in a good position and can be appropriately adjusted according to economic changes.\"\nInvestors are awaiting US December industrial production data and comments from Federal Reserve officials to determine the short-term direction of the US dollar.\nFrom a daily chart perspective, the US dollar against the Canadian dollar has retreated from a high of 1.3980 to around 1.3890 recently, with short-term bullish momentum weakening. The price is approaching the support level of the 10-day moving average, while the downward slope of the 5-day moving average indicates short-term correction pressure.\nThe MACD fast and slow lines remain above the zero axis, but the red histogram is gradually shortening, indicating weakening upward momentum; the RSI has declined to near 50, reflecting a neutral consolidation state in the market.\nBollinger Bands show that the price has pulled back from the upper band to near the middle band, with short-term volatility declining. The key short-term support range is between 1.3860 and 1.3880, while resistance levels are located at 1.3930 and 1.3980. A decisive breakout could allow the US dollar to regain upward momentum; if support is broken, downside potential may extend to around 1.3820. The overall structure suggests a high-level consolidation and correction pattern.\nEditorial View:\nThe short-term movement of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar is being influenced by both oil prices and expectations of Federal Reserve policy. Rising oil prices are providing support for the Canadian dollar, while solid US employment and retail data are maintaining the fundamental advantage of the US dollar, resulting in a volatile trading environment.\nThe technical outlook indicates a weakening of short-term bullish momentum, but no clear trend reversal signal has emerged. The exchange rate is expected to fluctuate within the range of 1.3860\u20131.3930. Attention should be paid to the short-term impact on the US dollar from US industrial production data and remarks by Federal Reserve officials.\nIf oil prices continue to rise, the Canadian dollar may receive additional support; if US economic data proves strong, the US dollar could experience a short-term rebound."

At the time of writing, the cross trades around 211.60, hovering near one-week lows.\nJapanese officials remain increasingly concerned about what they describe as one-sided and speculative currency moves, reiterating that recent Yen weakness does not reflect underlying economic fundamentals. Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said recently that authorities \u201cwill take appropriate action against excessive currency moves without excluding any options,\u201d including the possibility of coordinated action with the United States.\nThe latest bout of Yen underperformance has been largely driven by rising political uncertainty, after reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliament next week and call a snap general election as early as February.\nMeanwhile, attention is also turning to the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) interest-rate decision on January 23. The central bank is widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.75%, underscoring a gradual pace of normalization. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said earlier this month that the central bank remains prepared to raise interest rates further if economic conditions evolve in line with its projections.\nAccording to a recent Reuters poll, economists expect the BoJ to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming January and March meetings, but see further tightening later in 2026. Most respondents said the central bank will likely raise its key rate from the current 0.75% to 1.0% or higher by the end of September, with July cited as the most likely timing for the next hike.\nIn the UK, the policy outlook remains tilted toward gradual easing, though officials have signaled that the decision is becoming a closer call. Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Alan Taylor said this week that interest rates \u201cshould continue on a downward path, if my outlook continues to match up with the data, as it has done over the past year.\u201d\nLooking ahead, next week\u2019s calendar features several key data releases. In the UK, traders will focus on labour-market figures, inflation data, and Retail Sales. In Japan, the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due just hours ahead of the BoJ\u2019s policy decision.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored th"

Since they invest in the same thing, you almost need to split hairs to find a differentiator.\nWith Bitcoin ETFs, it all comes down to cost.\nIt's been a tumultuous year for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which ultimately produced a lot of volatility but nothing in the way of returns. After such a strong multiyear rally, a year \"off\" to digest gains and stabilize a bit is probably a good thing. But as we move forward into 2026, it's time to revisit the investment case again.\nBitcoin has, in my opinion, gone from alternative asset class to necessary portfolio allocation. In the same way we talk about stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate in a diversified portfolio, we should be adding Bitcoin to the discussion. Based on how the crypto market has evolved and the tailwinds of decentralization and AI development behind it, now's the time to look at building up Bitcoin positions again.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.

All invest in spot Bitcoin, so it makes sense to choose the one that lets you do it the cheapest.\nThe most popular Bitcoin ETF by a wide margin is the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) with more than $70 billion in assets under management. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, it's certainly a defensible choice. For my money, the one I'd load up on is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (NYSEMKT: BTC). It's got the lowest expense ratio in the group at just 0.15%. Plus, it's more than liquid enough that you don't get dinged on spreads when trading it.\nIt may not necessarily be the most popular Bitcoin ETF, but it will probably be the one producing the best returns over the long term.\nAdvertisement\nShould you buy stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

                "body": "Tom Lee thinks Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could hit $250,000 by the end of 2026\u2014and he\u2019s not relying on the usual halving playbook to get there. The Fundstrat co-founder argues the traditional four-year cycle is breaking down, replaced by forces that didn\u2019t exist in previous runs: ETF-driven demand, institutional accumulation, and a macro environment turning favorable for risk assets.\nIf Lee is right, Bitcoin isn\u2019t following the old pattern anymore. It\u2019s becoming a long-term macro asset, and the halving schedule matters less than who\u2019s buying and why they\u2019re holding.\nTom Lee Revives His $200K-$250K Bitcoin Target for 2026\nIn a series of high-profile appearances in early January, Tom Lee reiterated the aggressive Bitcoin forecast he had briefly softened during the October 2025 drawdown. Appearing on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on January 6, Lee stated that he doesn\u2019t think Bitcoin has peaked yet, reviving his $200K-$250K Bitcoin prediction for the end of 2026.\nHis immediate roadmap anticipates a 35% rally within the first 30 days of the year, pushing Bitcoin past its all-time high of $126,000. Lee\u2019s conviction stems from the belief that the market is currently in a digestion phase following multiple years of outsized gains.\nWhile he acknowledged that Fundstrat was overly optimistic about reaching $200,000 by December 2025, he views the current Bitcoin price action as healthy rebalancing rather than structural reversal. Lee\u2019s $250K Bitcoin prediction rests on three pillars: spot Bitcoin ETFs continuing to absorb supply, a maturing institutional investor base, and macroeconomic tailwinds that could push Bitcoin into unprecedented territory.\nBreaking the Four-Year Cycle: Why Traditional Halving Patterns May Not Apply\nBitcoin\u2019s price history has followed a predictable rhythm for over a decade. Every four years, the block reward for miners gets cut in half, reducing new supply entering circulation. These halvings have historically triggered major bull runs, followed by brutal corrections and multi-year consolidations.\nLee believes that pattern is losing its grip. He explained that the halving cycle worked when Bitcoin was primarily driven by retail speculation. Now, with institutional capital flowing through ETFs and corporate treasuries accumulating, the dynamics have fundamentally changed.\nThe Bitcoin halving cycle breakdown may already be underway. If Bitcoin is increasingly treated like digital gold\u2014a long-term portfolio hedge rather than a speculative trade\u2014its price could decouple from the rigid four-year rhythm. Instead of halving-driven boom-bust cycles, Lee envisions a more secular, demand-driven path where institutional allocation matters more than miner economics. This structural shift forms the foundation of Lee\u2019s 2026 Bitcoin outlook.\nLee\u2019s \u201cTailwinds Building\u201d Argument: Leverage Reset, Government Support, Gold Correlation\nLee identifies several emerging tailwinds supporting a Bitcoin surge toward $250,000. He frames these as \u201ctailwinds building\u201d rather than already priced in\u2014suggesting the rally hasn\u2019t fully begun.\nLeverage Reset: The October 2025 crash that liquidated $19 billion in leveraged positions may have \u201creset\u201d the market for fresh gains. Lee views this flush as the bottoming out necessary for the next decade-long focus on tokenization and institutional adoption. Similar leverage resets preceded Bitcoin\u2019s major rallies in 2020 and 2023. With excessive speculation cleared out, the market has room to build sustainably.\nGovernment Support: The Trump administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance, combined with anticipated CLARITY Act passage, could provide regulatory clarity that unlocks institutional capital currently sitting on the sidelines. Lee expects this government support to materially impact flows in H1 2026.\nGold Correlation: Stablecoin issuers such as Tether have become among the largest non-central-bank buyers of gold globally, holding approximately 116 tonnes as of Q3 2025. This positions Bitcoin alongside gold, which rose app"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF inflows cross $1.8B: Will BTC respond with a rally to $100K?\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) rally above $97,000 was supported by surging inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs, and one analyst says the demand must continue for BTC to break through the $100,000 barrier.\nKey takeaways:\nUS spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.8 billion in weekly net inflows, the strongest since early October 2025.\nTotal net assets under spot ETFs remain 24% below their Q4 2025 peak.\nLong-term supply-demand dynamics continue to favor ETFs, as institutional investor access is expected to expand in 2026.\nBitcoin ETF are only one part of the picture\nUS spot Bitcoin ETFs logged $1.8 billion in net inflows this week, marking the largest weekly intake since the first week of October 2025. The move comes as BTC again tests resistance near the $98,000 level, signaling renewed institutional interest.\nDespite the rebound, ETF positioning remains well below previous highs. The total net assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin ETFs peaked at $164.5 billion in Q4 2025 but currently stands near $125 billion. This represents a drawdown of roughly 24%, underscoring that recent inflows have only partially offset earlier outflows.\nAccording to the Bitcoin macro intelligence newsletter Ecoinometrics, short bursts of ETF inflows have repeatedly led to brief price bounces followed by fading momentum.\n\u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t need a few good days. It needs a few good weeks,\u201d the newsletter said, noting that cumulative ETF flows remain in a deep drawdown. A handful of positive sessions barely registers against prolonged periods of selling. Until inflows cluster over multiple weeks, rallies are more likely to stabilize the price than restart a durable uptrend.\nRelated: Bitcoin whale balances see 21% bounce after fastest sell-off since 2023 ends\nBTC supply-demand imbalance favors ETFs in the long-run\nFrom a structural standpoint, spot ETF demand continues to outpace new Bitcoin supply. According to Bitwise, since US Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, they have purchased about 710,777 BTC, while the network has produced just 363,047 BTC over the same period. Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen about 94% since then, reflecting that imbalance.\nLooking ahead, new supply is relatively predictable, while demand could expand further as institutional investor access to Bitcoin broadens. Notably, 2026 could be the year most institutional allocators continue to broadly access crypto ETFs, as Bitwise predicted,\nIn 2025, Bitwise forecast that Bitcoin inflows into publicly listed companies building BTC treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, ETFs and nation-states could reach $300 billion in 2026.\nThe company highlighted that US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $36.2 billion in net inflows in their inception year, reaching $125 billion in AUM far faster than SPDR Gold Shares did in its early growth phase.\nRelated: Bitcoin traders predict \u2018strong run-up\u2019 as classic chart targets $113K"

It funded the purchase by selling 1,080 BTC, securing long-term ownership of a 700 megawatt power site.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Riot has achieved full ownership of the Rockdale site, eliminating the prior ground lease. The site features a 700 megawatt grid interconnection, dedicated water supply and fiber connectivity. It expands the company's portfolio to 1.7 gigawatts of power capacity across its Texas facilities.\nThe company also signed a 10 year data center lease with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ:AMD) for an initial 25 megawatts of critical IT load, expandable to 200 megawatts.\nIt projects US$311 million in revenue initially, and up to US$1 billion with extensions.\nThe AMD lease requires retrofit CAPEX of US$89.8 million and is expected to generate US$25 million in annual net operating income, with phased delivery starting in January 2026 and completing in May 2026.\nRiot CEO Jason Les described the AMD deal as validation of the company's infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing tenants, marking a pivot from Bitcoin mining to data centers within 12 months.\nEthereum founder says blockchain nearing 2014 vision\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin said the network is finally delivering on the original 2014 vision as a series of technical upgrades push the blockchain closer to scalable, decentralized application infrastructure.\n\"Ethereum is now scaling, it is now cheap, and it is on track to get more scalable and cheaper thanks to the power of ZK-EVMs,\" Buterin posted on X on Tuesday (January 13).\nHis comments came as Ether climbed above US$3,300, reflecting renewed market confidence in the network\u2019s long-term roadmap.

The delay came about five hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly withdrew support for the bill. Armstrong cited objections to language on several issues, including tokenized securities, DeFi prohibitions, and stablecoin yield.\nThe Wednesday night postponement capped a whirlwind 48 hours that started with draft language being publicly released after 11 p.m. on Monday. More than 100 amendments to the bill were filed by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, and stakeholders were still identifying new issues with the bill as late as Wednesday morning.\nWhile Sen. Scott has not announced a future date for the hearing, the Senate is in recess next week, making the week of Jan. 26 \u2013 Jan. 30 the soonest possible time for a new Senate Banking markup hearing. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and will need to sign off on the commodities-related issues in the bill, already previously delayed its own markup hearing until Jan. 27.\nSenators, their staffs, and industry stakeholders mostly took Thursday off, the first break from what has been a hectic week and a half. No significant action is expected through the weekend, though negotiations are expected to restart in earnest next week.\nOn Thursday, liquid crypto markets traded moderately lower on news of the postponement, with bitcoin and ether down about 2% on the day. Crypto-relevant equities traded lower, with Coinbase (COIN) -6.5%, Robinhood (HOOD) -7.8%, and Circle (CRCL) -9.7%.\nOUR TAKE:\nThe path forward for the bill is narrower but not closed. The sheer litany of issues at stake and the complexity of the stakeholder environment bedeviled efforts to reach political agreement throughout the week. As I wrote last week, the \u201cmarket structure\u201d items were mostly agreed upon, but a range of additional issues (themselves still related but not core to the regulatory jurisdiction items that formed the foundation of the bill) created fault lines that could not be traversed in time to hold a successful markup on Thursday. There\u2019s no doubt that progress was made on some issues, and on several, the sides are not too far apart, but distance remains on some key dealbreakers in which progress was stubbornly slow or non-existent. Overall, the gap is narrow, but the chasm is deep.\nThe stablecoin yield issue is particularly instructive. Quick refresher: the issue is whether stablecoin issuers may share portions of the yield they generate on collateral with either B2B partners or tokenholders. Consensus on GENIUS Act language has been that issuers are prohibited from directly paying token holders, but that issuers could pass on rewards in other ways, such as through partner platforms. The bank lobby has become extremely active \u2013 much more so than during last year's GENIUS Act negotiations \u2013 and has been a driving force behind the effort to restrict stablecoin rewards, promoting a fear that interest-bearing stablecoins could siphon bank deposits. Essentially, the argument is that yield-bearing stablecoins can destabilize the banking system. Regardless of whether that fear is valid (a Cornell study found such fears to be overblown), a number of key Democrats and even some Republican holdouts made clear that they could not support the bill without explicit restrictions on stablecoin rewards.

Average daily trading value fell to US$21.99 billion (THB 714.67 billion), down 33.33%, reflecting subdued year-end sentiment as many investors reduced transactions and adopted a more cautious stance amid global market volatility.\nMarket structure remained concentrated in the leading assets, with Bitcoin holding the largest share at 55.02%, followed by Ethereum at 11.27% and USDT at 5.89%.\nOver the past month, prices for the five largest digital assets all declined. Bitcoin fell 4.66%, Ethereum slipped 2.34%, and XRP dropped sharply by 16.14%.\nLooking at one-year returns compared with other asset classes, the SEC said digital assets continued to underperform traditional assets. Gold posted a return of 64.58%, while global equities and emerging markets remained in positive territory. By contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded negative one-year returns of -6.47% and -11.02%, respectively.\nIn Thailand, the digital asset market via digital asset exchanges (DA Exchanges) also slowed in line with global trends. The value of client assets fell to THB 79.56 billion, down 7.29% month on month. Average daily trading value stood at THB 1.70 billion, down nearly 30%.\nThe number of active trading accounts declined to 151,000, a contraction of more than 27%, even as the total number of investor accounts rose to 3.09 million\u2014suggesting long-term investor participation is expanding despite weaker short-term trading activity.\nInvestor composition in the Thai market continued to be led by domestic retail investors, accounting for 41% of the total. Juristic persons, both domestic and foreign combined, accounted for more than 45%, reflecting the steadily growing role of institutional investors.\nBy trading value, USDT remained the most actively traded coin, making up 55% of total turnover, followed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. The SEC said this points to a preference for assets seen as less volatile during periods of uncertainty.\nOverall, the SEC said the digital asset market in December 2025 remained in a consolidation phase across prices, trading volumes and investor activity, while traditional assets such as gold and global equities delivered stronger returns over the past year."

This milestone isn\u2019t just a number\u2014it signals a potential turning point for decentralized finance (DeFi) and could redefine Solana\u2019s role in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. With Solana trading at $144.62 today, reflecting a 1.59% uptick in the last 24 hours, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether this surge marks the dawn of a new era or the inflation of a dangerous bubble. For investors, developers, and enthusiasts alike, this moment offers both opportunity and uncertainty. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how might it shape the future of blockchain technology? Let\u2019s dive deep into the data, the trends, and the implications to uncover what\u2019s really at stake.\nThe cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, and Solana\u2019s recent performance has turned heads across the financial world. As of today, the total crypto market cap stands at a hefty $3.32 trillion, according to CoinGecko data, with sentiment hovering at a neutral 50 on the Fear & Greed Index from Alternative.me. Amid this backdrop, Solana has outshone giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, posting a 1.59% price increase in just 24 hours while Bitcoin dipped by 0.27% to $95,354 and Ethereum fell 0.72% to $3,288.77.\nBut the real headline is the $15 billion stablecoin market cap on Solana\u2019s network\u2014a figure that underscores explosive growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoins, pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are the lifeblood of DeFi, enabling seamless transactions and lending without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. This surge suggests that users and developers are flocking to Solana, drawn by its lightning-fast transactions and low fees. Could this be the moment Solana cements itself as a true rival to Ethereum?\nFor investors, Solana\u2019s stablecoin boom is a double-edged sword. On one hand, a $15 billion market cap for stablecoins signals robust network activity and growing trust in Solana\u2019s infrastructure. This could translate to increased demand for SOL, the native token, potentially driving prices higher. If you\u2019re holding SOL or considering an entry point, now might be the time to get AI analysis for Solana to assess whether this momentum is sustainable.\nOn the flip side, such rapid growth often comes with heightened risk. A sudden influx of stablecoin activity could overheat the ecosystem, inviting speculative bubbles or exposing vulnerabilities in Solana\u2019s still-maturing network. Investors should weigh these factors carefully, balancing optimism with caution. Are you positioned to capitalize on this trend, or are you exposed to potential downturns?\nTo grasp the significance of Solana\u2019s $15 billion stablecoin milestone, we need to rewind a bit. Solana, launched in 2020, was designed to address the scalability issues plaguing older blockchains like Ethereum. Its unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism enables thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost\u2014think pennies compared to Ethereum\u2019s often exorbitant gas fees. This technological edge has made Solana a darling of DeFi developers, who are building everything from decentralized exchanges to lending platforms on its network.\nStablecoins are the backbone of DeFi, acting as a stable medium of exchange in a volatile market. Their $15 billion market cap on Solana, as reported by recent CoinGecko data, reflects a massive influx of liquidity into the ecosystem. This liquidity fuels trading, lending, and yield farming\u2014key activities that drive DeFi growth. But it also raises questions about w"

                "body": "MetaMask continues to expand beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. On Thursday, the wallet announced the addition of native support for the Tron blockchain. Previously, the team had already expanded functionality by integrating BTC and Solana networks.\nSupport for Tron is now available in both the mobile version of MetaMask and the browser extension. Users can now manage assets on the Tron network and interact directly with applications without leaving the wallet interface.\nThe integration allows swaps between Tron, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Solana, and BTC networks. Users can send USDT, stake TRX, and perform transactions across several supported blockchains through a single wallet.\n\u201cThe native integration of Tron is another important milestone in our multichain expansion strategy. Now, along with Solana and Bitcoin, this non-EVM network is available through a single interface,\u201d said MetaMask product manager Rizvi Haider.\nAccording to on-chain analytics from Dune, the Tron network has about 3 million active wallets per day. DeFi protocols on the blockchain have roughly $4.7 billion in locked assets.\n\u201cWe are going where the users already are, and step by step, we are moving closer to creating a truly universal gateway to the decentralized economy,\u201d he added.\nTron is especially popular among stablecoin users. The network has issued more than $81 billion USDT from Tether. This is just slightly less than Ethereum, where the USDT volume exceeds $85 billion.\nSee Also: Starknet and NEAR Join Forces to Bring STRK to the Solana Ecosystem\nMetaMask has long been associated with the Ethereum network. Parent company Consensys is considered one of the key software developers for this ecosystem.\nHowever, over the past year, the wallet has been expanding more actively beyond Ethereum. The reason is simple. Traders and investors are increasingly using multiple blockchains at once. Support for BTC appeared in December, after it was first hinted at in early 2025.\n\u201cObviously, MetaMask is the original Ethereum wallet, and it was initially created specifically for that network. But we have been exploring for quite some time how we can go beyond a single ecosystem,\u201d said MetaMask head of multichain products Cristian Montoya in January 2025."

Morgan reported strong revenue and loan growth but fell short of high profit expectations. The stock declined slightly after the earnings announcement.\nCitigroup posted strong numbers in banking growth and mergers and acquisitions activity, though profits came in slightly below expectations.\nBank of America and Wells Fargo reported strong profit and revenue growth, with fees performing well.\nDespite beating earnings expectations, bank stocks sold off due to high investor expectations and potential regulatory concerns.

The retreat was hardly dramatic, but it does highlight the challenge facing the index at these elevated levels.\nLosses in miners and oil stocks provided the main drag. When commodity-heavy sectors stumble, the FTSE tends to follow given its significant weighting towards these areas. The index has enjoyed a strong run but needs fresh catalysts to push higher.\nUnited Kingdom (UK) government bonds edged lower in early trade, while sterling firmed towards $1.34 as the United States (US) dollar softened across the board. The pound's strength reflects relative economic resilience, though concerns over data quality continue to simmer beneath the surface.\nChina rules hit commodity stocks\nCopper fell more than 2% after China tightened rules on high-frequency trading, dragging lower miners including Rio Tinto, Glencore and Antofagasta. The move caught markets off guard, sending ripples through the mining sector that few had anticipated.\nThe Chinese authorities' decision to clamp down on algorithmic trading reflects growing concerns about market stability. For commodity traders, it represents another regulatory hurdle in an already complex trading environment. These interventions rarely help sentiment in the short term.\nGenus defies market weakness\nGenus shares rose as much as 15% after the company said first-half and full-year profits would beat expectations. The animal genetics specialist benefited from strong demand in its pig breeding business, demonstrating that not all UK stocks are struggling.\nThe profit upgrade provided a welcome boost to a market otherwise dominated by commodity-driven losses. Genus's performance shows that company-specific factors can still drive significant moves, even when broader market conditions prove challenging.\nElsewhere, Bodycote agreed a US defence-focused acquisition, Ninety One reported higher assets under management, and Greencore completed its takeover of Bakkavor. These deals suggest corporate activity remains robust despite economic uncertainty.\nUK data concerns persist\nThe Office for National Statistics is considering delaying the launch of its new labour market survey again. This adds to mounting concerns over the quality and timeliness of UK economic data, creating headaches for policymakers and market participants alike.\nPoor data quality makes it harder for the Bank of England (BoE) to assess economic conditions accurately. When you can't trust the numbers, policy decisions become more fraught. This uncertainty tends to weigh on sterling and UK assets more broadly.\nThe data problems aren't new, but they're becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Markets need reliable information to price assets effectively. Without it, mispricing becomes more likely and confidence suffers.\nYen firms on intervention talk\nThe Japanese yen firmed modestly after Japan's finance minister said Tokyo would not rule out intervention, including coordination with Washington. The currency remains close to 160 per US dollar after falling to an 18-month low, but intervention talk has at least paused the decline.\nReuters reported that some Bank of Japan (BoJ) policymakers see scope to raise rates sooner than expected, possibly as early as April. This shift in expectations helped lift the yen, though political uncertainty around a potential snap election continues to create headwinds.\nAI trade lifts Asian markets\nAsian equities advanced as the artificial intelligence (AI) theme regained momentum following strong results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). The chip manufacturer's performance pushed MSCI Asia ex-Japan to a record and lifted tech-heavy indices in Taiwan and South Korea to all"

                "body": "Tech Weekly: Chip Stocks Soar on Taiwan Semiconductor Earnings\nExplore this week\u2019s top tech news and market movers, plus key catalysts to watch next week.\nWelcome to the Investing News Network's weekly brief on tech news and tech stocks driving the market.\nWe also break down next week's catalysts to watch to help you prepare for the week ahead.\nIn this article:\nThis week's tech sector performance\nTech stocks experienced sharp swings this week, starting on relatively firm footing before a broad selloff midway through the period gave way to a late rebound in semiconductor companies.\nA Sunday (January 11) statement from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell put pressure on US stocks ahead of Monday's (January 12) open, with \"sell America\" sentiment prevalent among investors. Powell's comments centered on a Department of Justice criminal probe into his testimony about Fed building renovations.\nFinancial and payment companies, including major credit card issuers, also sold off at that time following political pressure for a cap on credit card interest rates. However, the overall reaction was muted during Monday's trading session, with some early dips recovering fully, and indexes closing at record highs.\nRotation continued to be a major theme this week, with money moving out of some mega-cap tech names and into chip stocks, small-cap companies and resource plays. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ:AMD) rallied early on after being upgraded to \u201coverweight\u201d by KeyBanc Capital Markets on Tuesday (January 13). Citigroup (NYSE:C) also lifted its Intel rating to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201csell.\u201d\nWednesday (January 14) brought heavy selling in tech stocks, with high-flying growth names seeing losses; however, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) losses were comparatively mild.\nChipmakers were the bright spot, with the real catalyst coming on Thursday (January 15) after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) blowout quarterly results triggered a rally across chipmakers and chip equipment stocks, including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), AMD and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), which hit a US$500 billion market cap on Thursday.\nThis performance helped stabilize the broader tech space, although caution lingered.\n3 tech stocks moving markets this week\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM)\nAs mentioned, Taiwan Semiconductor reported blowout Q4 results and upbeat guidance on Thursday, fueled by relentless artificial intelligence (AI) demand. Revenue jumped 36 percent year-on-year, with management projecting 20 to 25 percent growth in 2026. Shares climbed 5.8 percent on the week.\n2. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)\nApplied Materials gained 8.56 percent amid the broader semiconductor equipment surge.\nThe company's high-bandwidth memory revenues hit US$1.5 billion in its 2025 fiscal year. This new growth engine is tied directly to NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU roadmap.\n3. KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC)\nKLA, a key supplier of process control equipment to chip fabricators, rode the Taiwan Semiconductor tailwind, rising 11.99 percent for the week as investors bet on sustained CAPEX from foundries.\nTaiwan Semiconductor, Applied Materials and KLA performance, January 12 to 16, 2025.\nChart via Google Finance.\nTop tech news of the week\n- OpenAI announced on Monday that it bought healthcare startup Torch, which unifies lab results, medications and visit recordings into a single platform.\n- Apple has teamed up with Google to integrate Gemini tech for Siri upgrades and other AI features rolling out later this year. The news contributed to another rally for Google, sending its market cap to US$4 trillion to surpass Apple as the second most valuable company behind NVIDIA.\n- Governor Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday in her State of the State address that New York is targeting 5 gigawatts in new nuclear capacity, boosting the total to 8.4 gigawatts.\n- OpenAI said it is commi"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined slightly, with all three major averages losing less than 1% for the week.\nThe Russell 2000 (^RUT) closed at a record high as the small-cap index extended year-to-date gains to 8%.\nStocks gave up earlier gains on Friday after President Trump expressed fresh reluctance to name Kevin Hassett as the next Fed chair, fueling speculation that the central bank may not be as dovish as the market expected once Jerome Powell steps down in May.\n\"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,\" he told Hassett at a White House event.\nWall Street is regrouping after a switchback week, marked by escalating Iran tensions, a dispute over Greenland, and a criminal probe risking the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence \u2014 all with Trump behind them. Investors have a long weekend to digest those events, as stock and bond markets are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nTSMC (TSM) and Nvidia (NVDA) rose, thanks in part to a US-Taiwan trade deal that promises a $250 billion boost to American chip and tech manufacturing. On Thursday, shares in TSMC popped following a strong quarterly report that revived AI enthusiasm to buoy related stocks more widely.\nShares of regional banks such as PNC (PNC) and Regions Financial (RF) rose on the heels of quarterly results following strong performance from Wall Street majors. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) shares rose Thursday after posting profit gains, giving a lift to financial stocks.\nMeanwhile, silver (SI=F) fell as the threat of US tariffs eased, but prices were still up more than 15% for the week after a long-lived blistering rally for precious metals.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 23 updates- Ines Ferr\u00e9\nStocks post weekly loss as Trump wavers on Kevin Hassett as next Fed Chair\nStocks ended the slight losses as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all shed less than 1% for the week.\nThe major averages opened with gains but dipped into red territory mid-morning after President Trump expressed reluctance about naming Kevin Hassett as the next Fed chair, putting into question how dovish the Fed will be once Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\nSemiconductor stocks ended the week with gains, but software names were hit over the threat of AI on their businesses.\nMeanwhile, the Russell 2000 small-cap index (^RUT) Russell 2000 closed at a record high as the small-cap index is up 8% year-to-date.\nThe New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and bond markets will be closed on Monday, Jan. 19, in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n- Grace O'Donnell\nAre US markets closed on MLK Day?\nThe New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and bond markets will be closed on Monday, Jan. 19, in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nYou can still place orders to buy and sell stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during extended trading hours, though there is added risk. And unlike the stock and bond markets, investors can trade crypto around the clock.\nWhen there's a major holiday, chances are that stock markets will close. Here's a look at the remaining stock market holidays for 2026:\n- Ines Ferr\u00e9\n'Structure trend of AI' will power stocks: UBS\nThe AI tech trade is intact, and expected to power stocks this year, say UBS strategists.\n\u201cWe maintain our conviction that the structural trend of AI will continue to power equity performance in the years ahead, and believe exposure to AI-related stocks is essential for long-term wealth preservation and appreciation,\" wrote Ulrike Hoffmann-Bur"

                "body": "S Korea's ex-president Yoon to be jailed for five years over martial law bid\nSouth Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.\nThis is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.\nYoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".\nFriday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations.\nThe most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.\nAbout 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.\nSome of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.\nOn Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\n\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said.\nProsecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.\nYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.\nHe had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.\nSouth Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.\nPark Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.\nSix months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory .\nBut Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.\nWhile his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.\nAdditional reporting by Koh Ewe"

                "body": "It\u2019s rare to get a bunch of scientists to agree on anything\u2014but health experts are near unanimous in saying that there\u2019s no scientific reason for the CDC\u2019s recent changes to the recommended childhood vaccine schedule. The American Academy of Pediatrics called the Trump administration\u2019s move \u201cdangerous and unnecessary.\u201d Omolara Thomas, MD, a pediatrician who specializes in public and global health, puts it bluntly: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s extreme to say that children will potentially die.\u201d\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s ferocious weirdness\u2014his alleged pregnancy fetish, his love of roadkill, his brain worm\u2014can make it hard to decipher any coherent ideology. Yet Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine project should be understood as part of the broader Trump agenda, part and parcel with ICE raids and cuts to health care subsidies and food stamps. It\u2019s a program that seeks to completely overhaul the American population and redefine who gets to be an American, as well as who deserves health and safety. Under Donald Trump, fitness, inherent health, and morality are all associated with a specific type of person: able-bodied, white \u201cheritage Americans.\u201d\nIf this all sounds vaguely familiar in a terrible, old-timey way, it\u2019s because this rhetoric echoes one of the darkest ideologies of the 19th and 20th centuries, one that has never really gone away: eugenics. Some eugenicists were obsessed with purity, and saw illness as nature\u2019s way of eliminating the unfit. Historical comparisons are never exact, but the reawakening of this ideology is pervasive once you start to notice it. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you were a musician and you kept hearing the same notes, and you said, \u2018Wait a minute, I know that tune,\u201d says Paul A. Lombardo, a legal historian of eugenics.\nKennedy has echoed these points in remarks like the ones he made last year, after a six-year-old Mennonite girl died from measles. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don\u2019t have good nutrition or who don\u2019t have a good exercise regimen.\u201d Texas officials told The New York Times that the little girl had been healthy before she contracted the disease.\nLast month, a contractor working with the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made similar comments, falsely claiming that hepatitis B is primarily a concern for babies of \u201cforeign-born\u201d mothers that occurs in some \u201chigh-risk immigrant families,\u201d and that there is little risk to the \u201caverage American child.\u201d Of course, in the real world, disease does not discriminate: Before rotavirus vaccination, for instance, the virus caused up to 70,000 hospitalizations and 60 deaths each year. Prominent pediatrician Paul Offit, MD, recently told The Atlantic about a nine-month-old girl he treated in the 1970s who had been totally healthy before she contracted rotavirus. She was so dehydrated that his team could not find a vein for an IV; he had to try to drill into her bone marrow to hydrate her. Despite her medical team\u2019s efforts, the girl died.\nThrowing around the word eugenics has become a bit like crying Nazi, but increasingly, using either term seems apt. Broadly, eugenics is the belief that society can engineer a better, stronger, and smarter population primarily by controlling who has babies. It\u2019s the notion that some people have bad genes, making them inherently weak\u2014a concept Trump loves. If those people reproduce, it\u2019s therefore a threat to the whole country.\nEugenics led to the forced\u2014but entirely legal!\u2014sterilization of disabled people and people of color in the US throughout the 20th century. Eugenics was never a fringe idea; it was seen as legitimate science, and promoted by many political and scientific leaders. In 1912, The New England Journal of Medicine, then known as the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, published an editorial titled \u201cImmigration as a Factor in the Increase of Insanity,\u201d an article that warned of the malign influe"
