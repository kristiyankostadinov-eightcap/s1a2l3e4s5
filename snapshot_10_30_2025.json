                "body": "During the Asian trading session on Thursday, international gold prices rebounded after a decline, reversing a four-day downward trend. Spot gold rose by approximately 0.8%, touching $3,962 per ounce before retreating.\nAmid diverging stances from Federal Reserve officials and a lack of key macroeconomic data, the market has once again become divided over the future direction of monetary policy. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced a modest interest rate cut of 25 basis points, lowering the benchmark rate range to 3.75%\u20144.00%.\nAlthough this move was widely anticipated by the market, Chairman Powell emphasized in the post-meeting statement that a December rate cut is \u201cfar from a done deal,\u201d indicating that policy remains flexible.\nNotably, this meeting marked the third consecutive instance of dissenting votes, the first time such a level of division has occurred since 2019.\n\u201cThis internal divergence makes it harder for the market to predict the policy path and has also weakened investor confidence in further easing.\u201d \u2014 Sebastian Mullins, Head of Multi-Asset at Schroders Investment. The U.S. government shutdown since early October has delayed the release of major economic data, depriving investors of critical decision-making references.\nHigher interest rates typically weigh on non-yielding assets like gold; however, a slight retreat in the U.S. Dollar Index (down 0.1%) provided some support to gold prices.\nIn terms of capital flows, five consecutive days of outflows from gold ETFs reflect a growing cautiousness among institutional investors. According to statistics, global gold ETF holdings have experienced their longest period of consecutive declines since May.\nNevertheless, gold prices have risen nearly 50% year-to-date, supported by central bank purchases and concerns over currency devaluation. Some institutions view the recent pullback as a normal technical correction, with the long-term fundamentals of the gold market remaining solid.\nOverall, the short-term rebound in gold prices was primarily driven by uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve policy and a pullback in the dollar, rather than a strong inflow of safe-haven funds. Future trends will depend on shifts in expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, outcomes of trade negotiations, and global investors\u2019 reassessment of inflation and fiscal deficits.\nFrom the perspective of the daily chart structure, gold stabilized and rebounded above USD 3,900 after experiencing four consecutive declines, forming a clear stage support. The MACD indicator shows an initial bottom divergence, with the RSI rising from the oversold zone to near 42, indicating potential for short-term corrective recovery.\nThe resistance level to watch is in the range of USD 3,990\u20134,020; a breakout would restart bullish momentum and potentially challenge USD 4,080. The key support below is at USD 3,920; a break below this level would confirm a medium-term adjustment pattern.\nThe overall technical picture indicates that gold prices are biased towards stronger volatility in the short term, but the medium-term trend still requires further confirmation from fundamentals.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nThe gold market is currently at a critical juncture characterized by intense bulls-versus-bears confrontation. While divisions within the Federal Reserve have provided the market with a rebound opportunity, Powell's \"cautious easing\" statement implies limited room for monetary loosening. As such, the short-term rebound in gold prices is more of a technical correction rather than a trend reversal."

                "body": "Oil Prices Strengthen After EIA Reports Big Inventory Decline\nOil prices rose on Wednesday after data revealed that U.S. crude and fuel inventories fell more than expected last week. The surprising drawdown came as President Donald Trump\u2019s positive outlook on upcoming U.S.\u2013China trade talks helped ease economic concerns.\nBrent crude futures climbed 52 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $64.92 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 33 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $60.48.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil, gasoline, and distillate fuel stockpiles each fell more than analysts had forecast. Crude oil stocks dropped by nearly 7 million barrels, a sharp contrast to the predicted 211,000-barrel decline.\nAnalysts Reassess Global Oil Surplus Expectations\nThe substantial decline in inventories prompted many analysts to reconsider assumptions of an oil glut in global markets. With the OPEC+ alliance increasing output and U.S. production at record highs, the latest EIA figures challenged the widespread belief that supply would soon outpace demand.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the glut?\u201d asked Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn following the report. \u201cThe longer the glut doesn\u2019t hit, the more we will question whether it exists,\u201d he said.\nFlynn\u2019s remarks underscore a growing shift in sentiment. Traders now see the latest data as proof that strong demand continues to absorb available supply, even with ongoing production growth from major producers.\nEIA Data Suggests Strong Implied Oil Demand\nThe EIA data not only revealed tighter inventories but also suggested robust implied demand for oil in the United States. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo emphasized that the combination of falling stockpiles and strong consumption signals \u201ca very positive development for crude oil prices.\u201d\nThe EIA\u2019s findings fueled renewed optimism among energy investors. Many believe the results show the market remains well-balanced despite production increases.\nNatural Gas Prices Slip Slightly\nWhile crude oil gained ground, natural gas prices edged lower during Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Prices settled at $3.336 per MMBtu, down $0.009, or 0.27%, from the previous day. Analysts attributed the dip to mild weather patterns and steady storage levels across key regions.\nOklahoma Energy Stocks Decline Despite Oil Price Gains\nDespite stronger oil prices, the day ended with losses for the majority of Oklahoma energy stocks. Empire Petroleum led the local market decline, falling nearly 6% for the day. Other Oklahoma-based energy companies saw smaller losses ranging between 1% and 2%.\nTraders said the mixed performance reflected sector-specific volatility, with investors awaiting upcoming quarterly earnings reports and further clarity on domestic production trends.\nUSD\u22120.19\nUSD\u22120.040\nUSD+0.040\nUSD\u22120.20\nUSD\u22120.59\nUSD\u22121.57\nUSD\u22120.010\nUSD\u22120.19\nUSD\u22120.060\nUSD+0.41\nUSD+0.010\nUSD\u22120.98\nUSD\u22122.17\nUSD+0.30\nUSD+0.14\nUSD\u22120.010\nUSD+0.11\nUSD+0.21\nUSD\u22120.61"

The increases \u2014 which include new projects as well as acquisitions \u2014 appear designed to capitalize on an expected oil-price upturn in the latter half of next year.\nBut they could add to the supply glut in the short term.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking the long view that oil demand is going to be a lot more resilient post-2030,\u201d Noah Barrett, a research analyst at Janus Henderson, which manages about $457 billion. \u201cIf they\u2019re not making the investments today, then their portfolios will be really disadvantaged when prices move higher.\u201d\nAfter years of outsized profits as oil demand roared back following the pandemic, the world\u2019s largest energy companies are feeling the pinch of crude prices that have dropped about 14% this year near to a four-year low. In response, they\u2019re cutting jobs, reducing low-carbon investments and trimming share buybacks to channel funds toward the most valuable part of their business: oil and gas production.\n\u201cAll the supply coming to the market is shrinking OPEC\u2019s spare capacity \u2014 so there\u2019s a light at end of the tunnel, Betty Jiang, an analyst at Barclays Plc. \u201cWhether that\u2019s second half of 2026 or 2027, the balance is going to tighten. It\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d\nRecent US sanctions on key Russian giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC provided respite from oil\u2019s fall this year, with Brent crude rising 7.5% last week to more than $65 a barrel. But the oil market is oversupplied heading into 2026 and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies remain focused on adding more supply.\nIt may seem counterintuitive for the supermajors to add barrels to such a market, but executives have an eye on the future, when crude may not be so plentiful. Oil demand is still growing, albeit slowly, while US shale and supply from new fields in Guyana and Brazil are likely to decelerate in the latter half of the decade.\nThe growth is coming from three main sources. The first is investments made within the past few years that are now bearing fruit, like Chevron\u2019s Ballymore project in the US Gulf. The second source is new projects, such as Exxon\u2019s Uaru development in Guyana. And the third is acquisitions, which add to companies\u2019 individual production without adding barrels to global supply. The biggest examples are Exxon buying Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Chevron buying Hess Corp.\nThe US majors are advancing on all three of those fronts while Shell and BP are focusing on the first two for now. That\u2019s because their lower value stock makes deals more difficult to pull off. The trend stands in stark contrast to the downturn in oil prices during the pandemic, when companies cut capital spending and slowed majors projects because oil demand fell fast and they were unsure when it would return.\n\u201cThese are multi-year investments\u201d that cannot be ramped up or down based on short-term price fluctuations, Jiang said. \u201cBuilding them now means they\u2019ll be ready for when oil prices inevitably turn.\u201d\nSelling more barrels will also help mitigate lower prices in the short run. The five supermajors will likely post combined profits of $21.76 billion for the third quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s 7% higher than the previous three months, helped by better refining margins. But it\u2019s less than half the levels of 2022. The industry has hiked dividends and buybacks since then, making the payouts harder to sustain.\n\u201cThis has been the most well-telegraphed oil glut in history, which suggests that it won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d James West, managing director of energy and power "

At the time of writing, the pair trades volatile, as traders await the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.\nDollar swings as traders await Powell\u2019s tone for clues on future easing path\nThe majority of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to reduce the fed funds rate to 3.75%-4%. The two dissenters were Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who cast a dovish note by voting for a 50 bps rate cut, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid opted to keep rates unchanged.\nIn its statement, the Federal Reserve said \u201cthat economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.\u201d\nThey added, \u201cThe Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1,\u201d signaling an end to its balance sheet runoff as part of its ongoing policy recalibration.\nEUR/USD reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision\nEUR/USD remains at around familiar levels, near 1.1650, with traders eyeing Powell. On the upside, the first key resistance would be the day\u2019s high at 1.1665, followed by 1.1700. Conversely, on the downside, the first support would be the day\u2019s low of 1.1618, followed by 1.1600.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nChristian Borjon Valencia\nFXStreet\nChristian Borjon began his career as a retail trader in 2010, mainly focused on technical analysis and strategies around "

                "body": "The Euro\u2019s recent recovery against the US Dollar ended as it fell to 1.1630 from a high of 1.1670. Traders are cautious, awaiting the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision. The slowdown in Spain\u2019s Q3 GDP, to 0.6% compared to the prior 0.7%, along with a dip in retail consumption, could pressure the Euro further.\nThe US Dollar lacks momentum ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy announcement. A 25 basis point rate cut is expected, and traders are keenly observing Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s statements for clues about future monetary easing. The Fed\u2019s signal on ending its Quantitative Tightening program is also highly anticipated. Meanwhile, the ECB is expected to maintain its current monetary policy.\nTechnical Analysis Of Eur Usd\nTechnically, EUR/USD\u2019s attempt to rally has faltered, with the pair struggling around 1.1670. Key support is near 1.1615. A drop below this level could encourage further selling towards the October lows. Resistance is around the recent high of 1.1670, and a breach could push the pair towards 1.1730. The market remains fixated on the Fed\u2019s decision and subsequent policy statement, which have considerable potential to influence the currency markets.\nWith the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision just hours away, the market is positioned for a 25 basis point cut, which is largely priced into the current EUR/USD level. The real opportunity for traders will come from Chairman Powell\u2019s forward guidance, as futures markets are already showing a 91% probability of another cut in December. We see this as a classic \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d scenario unless Powell signals an even more aggressive easing path.\nRecent economic data gives us reason to expect a dovish tone from the Fed, justifying the market\u2019s lean. The last Non-Farm Payrolls report showed job creation slowing to 145,000, while the most recent GDP figures for the third quarter of 2025 came in at a softer 1.9%. These figures suggest that the aggressive rate hikes we saw back in 2022 and 2023 are finally cooling the economy, giving the Fed room to continue cutting.\nDerivatives And Market Strategy\nFor derivative traders, this uncertainty creates a prime environment for volatility strategies. We are seeing increased interest in at-the-money straddles on the EUR/USD, which would profit from a significant price swing in either direction following the announcement. If Powell is unexpectedly hawkish, the dollar could rally, whereas a confirmation of more cuts could send it lower, making this a play on the magnitude of the move, not its direction.\nLooking back, the rapid hiking cycle that took the Fed Funds rate above 5% in 2023 was designed to curb high inflation. Now, with the latest CPI data from September 2025 holding at a more manageable 3.1%, the Fed is in a phase of policy normalization. This pivot from tightening to easing is a multi-month trend that we expect to continue into early 2026.\nOn the other side of the currency pair, the Euro has its own challenges that may cap any significant rally. The unexpected slowdown in Spain\u2019s Q3 GDP, coupled with Germany narrowly avoiding a recession last quarter, suggests the European Central Bank will be reluctant to adopt a hawkish stance. With the ECB deposit rate at 2%, the policy divergence still favors the US Dollar on a yield basis, even with today\u2019s expected cut.\nTherefore, we are watching key technical levels to structure derivative trades around the Fed\u2019s announcement. A decisive break below the 1.1615 support area would likely see an increase in put option volume, targeting the 1.1576 level. Conversely, a dovish surprise could push the pair through the 1.1670 resistance, and traders holding call options with strikes at 1.1700 or higher would be well-positioned."

                "body": "The Impact Of The Fed\u2019s Interest Rate Cut\nDuring American trading, GBP/USD fell below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. The GBP\u2019s decline has been worsened by a general market shift towards safer assets like the Dollar as a result of risk aversion.\nPowell\u2019s cautious statements hint at a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach, causing uncertainty about future rate cuts. With limited economic data and cautious market mood, the outlook for the Pound remains weak. In conclusion, GBP/USD\u2019s fall underscores the impact of US monetary decisions and politics on currency values, as the Dollar gains amid reduced expectations for aggressive Fed moves.\nGiven the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent actions on October 29, 2025, we see a clear path for a stronger dollar in the near term. The break below the 200-day EMA in GBP/USD is a significant technical signal that confirms the bearish momentum. We should therefore position for further pound weakness against the dollar over the next several weeks.\nFor those trading derivatives, buying GBP/USD put options with December or January 2026 expiries appears to be a prudent strategy. This allows us to capitalize on downside potential while strictly defining our maximum risk to the premium paid. The market\u2019s repricing of future Fed rate cuts provides the fundamental driver for this trade.\nUK Domestic Data And Strategy\nThis bearish view on the pound is reinforced by recent domestic data out of the UK. The latest Office for National Statistics release showed UK GDP growth for the third quarter was a sluggish 0.1%, while core inflation has fallen to 2.4%. These figures give the Bank of England little reason to consider a hawkish stance, leaving the pound fundamentally unsupported.\nConversely, the Fed\u2019s cautious tone is understandable when we consider the resilience of the US labor market. The last Non-Farm Payrolls report in early October 2025 showed a healthy addition of 215,000 jobs, keeping the unemployment rate at a low 3.8%. This underlying economic strength justifies the Fed\u2019s hesitation to promise further rate cuts, supporting the dollar\u2019s value.\nWe have seen this pattern before, such as during the Fed\u2019s policy pivot in 2019, where an initial \u201chawkish cut\u201d also led to a period of dollar strength. In that instance, markets had to swiftly unwind expectations of a deep easing cycle, pushing the dollar higher against its peers. The current environment feels remarkably similar, suggesting this dollar rally has more room to run.\nThe ongoing US government shutdown introduces a layer of uncertainty that should keep implied volatility elevated. While this makes buying options more expensive, it also means that a correctly anticipated move could be highly profitable. Traders could also consider using bear put spreads to lower the entry cost of a bearish position while targeting a specific downward range for GBP/USD."

Dollar strength and global risk aversion deepen the slide | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Forecast: Sterling Slides Toward 1.3240 as Fiscal Gap, BoE Cut Odds, and Fed Decision Pressure Pound\nGBP/USD Under Renewed Pressure as Fiscal Concerns Deepen and Dollar Strengthens\nThe British Pound to U.S. Dollar (GBP/USD) remains under intense selling pressure, trading near 1.3280 after briefly touching 1.3247, marking its weakest level since August. The pair has fallen more than 3.4% from September\u2019s peak at 1.3725, extending a two-week decline as investors reassess the UK\u2019s fragile fiscal position and upcoming monetary decisions on both sides of the Atlantic. Market sentiment toward Sterling has deteriorated sharply following the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) warning of a \u00a320 billion shortfall in government finances, a gap that could widen to \u00a335 billion under current productivity and growth assumptions.\nThe OBR\u2019s findings fuel speculation that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may introduce tax hikes in the November Budget to stabilize public accounts. Such a move could tighten household spending and consumer demand, threatening the UK\u2019s already sluggish recovery. The UK economy remains structurally weak \u2014 GDP growth is stalling near 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, productivity continues to lag, and inflation, though easing, underscores a fragile backdrop. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s data revealed softer food prices and inflation slowing to 1.8%, giving markets confidence that the Bank of England (BoE) could pivot toward easing sooner than expected. Traders now assign a 68% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, a dramatic shift from earlier expectations of a prolonged pause.\nDollar Firm Ahead of Fed Rate Cut and Powell\u2019s Guidance\nOn the U.S. side, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its second 25-bps rate cut of 2025, lowering the target range to 3.75%\u20134.00%. However, the market\u2019s focus is firmly on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s tone regarding future policy. A dovish statement signaling more cuts before year-end could provide some relief for the Pound, while a measured or hawkish stance could drive further downside toward 1.3140 or lower. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades steady near 98.70, supported by safe-haven demand amid global uncertainty and the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing Asia visit, which produced a U.S.\u2013Japan minerals alliance agreement aimed at securing rare earth supply chains.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision comes as U.S. macro data weakens: Conference Board consumer confidence dropped to 94.1, ADP private payrolls fell by 36,000, and housing data showed prices slowing for the seventh consecutive month. Despite these signals, the Dollar remains resilient, reflecting investors\u2019 preference for liquidity and yield amid heightened volatility in Europe and Asia.\nFiscal Anxiety and Volatility Build Ahead of Reeves\u2019s Budget\nThe upcoming UK Autumn Budget has become a defining risk event for Sterling. With the implied volatility on GBP/USD options rising to a three-month high, traders are increasingly positioning for sharper moves as fiscal risk looms. If Reeves confirms new spending commitments without clear funding clarity, markets could interpret the plan as fiscally expansionary, reviving concerns similar to the 2022 mini-budget crisis that triggered a sharp Sterling collapse.\nInvestors are also monitoring BoE communication, with Governor Andrew Bailey expected to emphasize data dependency. Market pricing now implies 50 bps of total easing by mid-2026, though fiscal stress may accelerate that timeline. For Sterling, this combination of monetary and fiscal fragility leaves little room for optimism in the near term, especially as the Dollar continues "

Soybean purchases will begin immediately, and China has agreed to intensify efforts to curb the fentanyl problem. However, Trump noted that not all issues were discussed.\nThe AUD gained support after Australia\u2019s hotter-than-expected Q3 inflation and August CPI data were released on Wednesday. The stronger readings reduced expectations for near-term rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). RBA Governor Bullock noted that the labor market remains somewhat tight, despite the unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.\nUS Dollar declines over an uncertain Fed policy outlook\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is losing ground after registering gains in the previous session and trading around 98.90 at the time of writing.\n- The Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point interest rate cut on Wednesday. This marks the second straight interest rate cut from the Fed, albeit with some policymakers making a mental note of a general increase in some inflationary pressures through the second half of the year, but not enough to deter another leg down in interest rates.\n- The US Dollar gained ground after the Fed acknowledged it would continue to ease back on Quantitative Easing (QE) practices, with the process of drawing down the Fed's mortgage-backed asset balance sheet into long-term Treasuries by December 1.\n- Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the post-meeting press conference that the available data indicate little change in the outlook for employment and inflation since the September meeting. Powell noted that the government shutdown will weigh on economic activity while it continues, but should reverse once it ends. He added that another rate cut in December is far from certain, emphasizing that the path forward remains uncertain.\n- The RBA Trimmed Mean CPI for Q3 rose 1.0% and 3.0% on a quarterly and annual basis, respectively. Markets estimated an increase of 0.8% QoQ and 2.7% YoY in the quarter to September. The monthly Consumer Price Index jumped by 3.5% YoY in August, compared to the previous reading of a 3.0% increase. This figure came in hotter than the expectation of 3.1%.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.0% year-over-year (YoY) in September, following a 2.9% increase in the prior month. This reading came in below the market expectation of 3.1%. Meanwhile, the monthly CPI increased 0.3%, against the 0.4% rise seen in August. The core CPI increased 0.2% month-over-month, compared to the market consensus of 0.3%, while the yearly core CPI was up 3.0% in September.\nAustralian Dollar tests 0.6600 barrier due to possible bullish shift\nThe AUD/USD pair is trading around 0.6590 on Thursday. Technical analysis of a daily chart suggests a neutral bias as the pair moves within a rectangle pattern. The pair is trading above the nine-day Exponential Mov"

Annually, the CPI also exceeded the 3.0% expected forecast and stood at 3.2% YoY. The Australian CPI M/M witnessed a 3.5% YoY, shaped by increased housing and transport expenses.\nThe CPI readings have reduced the probability of RBA rate cuts amid persistent price pressure.

                "body": "USD/JPY outlook: BOJ holds but hike risk remains, yen softens\n- BOJ keeps rates at 0.5%, two dissenters back a hike\n- Inflation, GDP forecasts largely unchanged\n- Traders price 55% chance of December hike ahead\n- Tokyo CPI key release on Friday\n- USD/JPY reverses early losses, eyes October highs\nSummary\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) held rates steady in October, leaving key growth and inflation forecasts largely unchanged from three months earlier. That helped USD/JPY reverse higher for the session. However, with two board members again voting to increase policy rates, the risk of a hike by year-end remains, especially if trade uncertainty continues to fade.\nBOJ Delivers Repeat Performance\nAs widely expected, the BOJ left overnight rates unchanged at 0.5%, voting 7\u20132 in favour. Board member Takata and Tamura once again dissented, advocating for a 25bp increase to 0.75%. Takata argued Japan has shifted away from the deflationary environment of prior decades, suggesting the bank\u2019s price stability mandate has essentially been met. Tamura said price risks remain skewed to the upside, meaning policy rates should be closer to his assessed neutral rate\u2014the level where rates neither stimulate nor restrict economic activity, theoretically keeping inflation stable.\nNeither argument differed from those offered six weeks ago. The risk heading into the meeting was that another board member might join the dissenters. That didn\u2019t happen, which largely explains why the yen weakened slightly after the decision.\nKey Inflation, GDP Forecasts Largely Unchanged\nSource: BOJ\nLike the vote, updated growth and inflation forecasts were essentially unchanged. GDP is expected to grow 0.7% in the year beginning April 2026, with 2027 also left at 1%. With little change in expected activity, the bank\u2019s preferred inflation measure\u2014excluding fresh food\u2014is seen holding two tenths below its 2% target in both years. Excluding both fresh food and energy, core-core inflation is forecast at 2% over both years, with the 2026 forecast revised up a tenth from 1.9%.\nGiven recent signs of disinflation\u2014partly driven by government subsidies\u2014Friday\u2019s Tokyo inflation report for October will be closely watched. It arrives three weeks ahead of the nationwide report and comes as traders view the chance of a 25bp hike in December as a coin flip.\nDecember Rate Hike Remains in Play\nSource: Bloomberg\nAs shown in implied swaps pricing from Bloomberg above, a hike at the final meeting of the year is marginally favoured at 55%. By the time FY26 wage negotiations are underway in March, a full hike is priced in, with another nearly fully factored by September. The Tokyo inflation print could significantly influence that pricing, especially if it deviates from consensus. The ex-fresh food measure is expected to lift a tenth to 2.6%, as is the core-core measure. These are the key figures to watch\u2014not the headline.\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY Bulls Eye Breakout\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY, down more than 0.3% before the decision, rallied once it came through, pushing back toward highs set earlier this month. With RSI (14) climbing above 50 but not yet overbought, upside pressure is building. MACD has confirmed the bullish signal, staging a crossover two weeks ago and continuing to trend higher. The setup favours buying dips and bullish breaks.\nShould resistance at 153.28 crack, it may act as a launchpad for fresh bullish setups, allowing longs to be established on the break with a stop below for protection, targeting resistance at 154.80 initially.\nBullish setups would be further supported if BOJ Governor Ueda delivers dovish guidance, as has often been the case recently. Watch for his headlines to hit the tape in the coming hours. The ongoing meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will also be important.\nOf course, if 153.28 resistance holds or unexpectedly bullish yen headlines emerge, the level could also be used to establish fresh shorts, with positions set beneath and a stop above for"

Subscribe here to unlock access to InvestingPro\u2019s AI-selected stock winners.\nRisk appetite remained firm heading into a busy 48 hour period for markets, where major central banks decide on interest rates, technology companies will report their quarterly results, and more to the point, Trump will meet Xi Jinping in a meeting expected to last three hours. Ahead of the Trump-Xi summit, warm words were shared by Trump who said that things will work out very well with the Chinese premier, adding that he plans to ease tariffs on Chinese goods tied to fentanyl dispute. Meanwhile Trump also said he will talk about Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell AI chips, sending the company\u2019s shares 5% higher in pre-market and lifting futures on the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 to new record levels. In FX space, the yen was weakening amid ongoing risk-on sentiment across financial markets. The USD/JPY\u2019s direction could become clearer this week, with the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan rate decisions to come in the next couple of days.\nJapan\u2019s Fiscal Expansion vs. Monetary Tightening\nDespite the dollar\u2019s weakness this year against most other major currencies, the USD/JPY currency pair has held its own well until now. This is partly because of the ongoing risk rally keeping demand for the low yielding JPY downbeat, with traders using the currency as a carry trade. Shorting the dollar, meanwhile is expensive as the overnight financing costs can be significant given that US interest rates are among the highest in the world. But back to Japan, here there is increased hopes that Japan\u2019s new government will embark on an aggressive fiscal expansion. While this could boost economic growth significantly, there is a risk it could further increase the government\u2019s debt and raise the nation\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio even higher than what it is right now, should growth not materialise as much as expected.\nBut if the fiscal expansion does lead to sustainable GDP growth, then this will be increasing the pressure on the Bank of Japan to respond by tightening policy. But they could be forced to act sooner than expected if inflation doesn\u2019t go down fast. Traders will be looking for clues about the near-term path of policy at Thursday\u2019s policy meeting, with many analysts anticipating a rate hike to come in December.\nWhat About the Fed?\nAcross the Pacific, the Federal Reserve is widely tipped to cut rates again tomorrow. Should Chair Jerome Powell sound more dovish than markets expect, the US dollar index could find itself under renewed downward pressure.\nAttention will also be on Thursday\u2019s meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi, where investors hope some progress will be made in the trade talks. Any further delays or scaling-back of tariff measures would likely provide a further boost to sentiment.\nHowever, even if the Trump\u2013Xi summit brings a positive surprise, it may not be enough to offset the dollar\u2019s broader drift lower. The Fed, ECB, BoJ, and BoC all meet this week, with the Fed expected to trim rates by 25 basis points. Dollar positioning is less one-sided than earlier in the year, which could limit any outsized reaction to dovish rhetoric. Recent soft CPI data has already reduced the chances of a hawkish surprise.\nThat means the USD/JPY could potentially move back below 150.00, especially if the BoJ springs a hawkish surprise or signals a steeper path to normalisation than expected.\nMeanwhile, Japanese policymakers will be watching the yen closely, and history shows they\u2019re not shy about intervening. Should USD/JPY surge towards the 155\u2013160 region, Tokyo could step in to support the yen once more. Until then,"

The real surprise came when the central bank suggested it was done with cutting rates for now, cooling expectations for further easing. That hawkish signal pushed the Canadian dollar up 0.4% to its highest since last September, and sent government bond yields climbing, narrowing the gap with US Treasurys. The loonie also got a lift from rising oil prices\u2014Canada\u2019s top export\u2014after a drop in US inventories. Meanwhile, the US dollar stayed mostly stable ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s own rate decision later in the day.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A stronger loonie rewrites the script.\nWhen the loonie flexes, Canadian assets become more enticing for international investors and imported goods get a little cheaper. With rate cuts now on hold, traders are betting the Bank of Canada will stay steady into 2026. That shift fired up bond yields and narrowed the spread with US bonds, hinting at possible inflows of foreign cash. But Canadian exporters might feel the squeeze of a pricier currency\u2014especially with oil prices bouncing around.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks call the global shots.\nCanada\u2019s pause on rate cuts turns the spotlight to other central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, leaving markets on edge. Exchange rates, trade flows, and the outlook for global growth all hang in the balance\u2014particularly for resource-heavy countries like Canada that ride the waves of commodity prices.

                "body": "USD/CAD remains below its 200-day moving average of 1.3952 as markets anticipate the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decision. A 25bps cut to 2.25% is expected, but fiscal support and firm inflation make further cuts unlikely.\nThe swaps market indicates a 90% chance of a 25bps rate cut and a 50% chance for another cut to 2.00% within a year. US trade policy uncertainty is affecting Canada\u2019s economy, with President Trump ending trade talks and increasing tariffs on Canadian goods.\nBank Of Canada\u2019s Policy Rate Strategy\nIt is expected that the BOC will avoid cutting the rate below the estimated neutral range of 2.25% to 3.25%. The Canadian government is likely to announce a stimulative budget, in contrast to the UK\u2019s upcoming budget, which may slow its economy. This could lead to GBP\u2019s underperformance against the CAD.\nThe FXStreet Insights Team compiles market observations from experts, including analysis from commercial and internal sources.\nWe are looking at a very different situation today, on October 29, 2025, compared to the past environment discussed here. The Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate isn\u2019t being cut to 2.25%; it currently stands firm at 4.5% following the aggressive hiking cycle of 2022-2023. The market\u2019s primary focus now is on how long rates will stay at this restrictive level, not on an easing cycle.\nTrade Strategies And Market Observations\nThe concerns about firm inflation mentioned in the analysis were prescient, as we all remember inflation peaking above 8% back in 2022. Even now, the latest data from Statistics Canada shows core inflation is stubbornly holding around 2.9%, which is keeping the Bank of Canada on hold. This makes the idea of imminent rate cuts highly improbable, unlike the scenario from the past.\nThe acute trade uncertainty from the Trump administration has been replaced by the more structured CUSMA framework. As a result, implied volatility in USD/CAD options has fallen from the highs seen during those earlier trade disputes. With USD/CAD currently trading around 1.3615, well below the 1.3952 level mentioned previously, the market is pricing in more stability.\nGiven the high interest rate differential between Canada and the U.S., traders should consider strategies that benefit from this. Selling USD/CAD forward contracts to collect the positive carry is a viable strategy, as the Bank of Canada is widely expected to hold rates higher for longer than the U.S. Federal Reserve. For options traders, selling premium through strategies like iron condors could be effective, capitalizing on the expected range-bound movement in the currency pair.\nThe old expectation of GBP underperformance against the CAD remains relevant. The UK economy continues to face challenges with sluggish growth, and the Bank of England has signaled a greater willingness to start cutting its own high rates in early 2026. This policy divergence should continue to weigh on the GBP/CAD cross, presenting potential bearish opportunities for derivative positions."

The Bank of Japan made a statement overnight that it believes forex moves should represent fundamentals. To me, that\u2019s something they\u2019ve said multiple times in the past, and it always leads to the same thing: the Japanese yen strengthening for a little bit, only to see buyers coming back into the market and shorting it again.\nTop Forex Brokers\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m looking at the area right around the 50-day EMA as an area that could offer support, right along with the \u00a5200 level. Because of this, I\u2019m looking for an opportunity to buy this pair on some type of bounce. As things stand right now, it looks like we have plenty of pressure to the downside, so I would have to be very patient here. All things being equal, this is a scenario where I think you look for value and take advantage of it\u2014not only are we in a significant uptrend, but we also have the interest rate differential between the British pound and the Japanese yen.\nA Potential Target\nAll things being equal, this is a market that I think tries to get back to the \u00a5205 level, an area that has previously been very difficult to break above. If we can break above that level, then we could go much higher. Ultimately, I do think that\u2019s what happens, and I favor the British pound over the Japanese yen. That\u2019s probably true with most currencies, but the interest rate differential between the British pound and the Japanese yen is much wider than what\u2019s found in other pairs, such as the Canadian dollar or even the Swiss franc against the yen.\nNot all pairs are going to move with the same type of momentum, although they do tend to move in the same general direction. All things being equal, this is a market where I\u2019m looking for a buying opportunity that I expect to take advantage of in the next day or two.\nBegin trading our daily forecasts and analysis.

The pair depreciated about 1.34% in the last two days, retreating from levels above 204.00 to three-week lows near 201.00 at the time of writing.\nThe Sterling was hammered on Tuesday after the UK Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) slashed its productivity growth forecasts for the next five years by 0.3%, likely adding a GBP 20 billion hole to the already strained public finances.\nFurthermore, a gauge of UK shop inflation showed a significant moderation in price pressures, confirming the disinflationary pressures revealed at September's Consumer Prices Index release, and keeping hopes of further BoE monetary easing alive.\nThe Yen, on the other side, has received a boost from US President Donald Trump, who has praised Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, after their meeting on Tuesday, and comments from US Treasury Secretary Bessent, assuring that the Japanese authorities will not threaten the Bank of Japan\u2019s independence.\nThe BoJ is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold after its meeting on Thursday, but Bessent\u2019s words have boosted hopes of a rate hike in December or January, which has given a fresh impulse to the Yen.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pa"

The zone also coincides with the neckline of a potential double-top pattern, raising the risk of a bearish reversal if the price closes decisively below this level.\nA sustained break beneath 200.00 would likely open the door for a deeper pullback toward the October 3 high at 198.87, which also aligns with an unfilled bullish gap from October 6. A daily close below that area could reinforce the downside momentum, exposing further support near 197.50.\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is seen around the 21-day SMA at 202.16. A recovery above this dynamic barrier could ease the bearish pressure and allow the pair to retest the 204.00 mark.\nMomentum indicators reflect weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits around 44.8, signaling bearish bias, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a fresh bearish crossover, with the histogram extending into negative territory.\nLooking ahead, the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) monetary policy decision due on Thursday could trigger fresh volatility, with the central bank expected to keep rates unchanged amid Japan\u2019s shifting fiscal outlook.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

The Ethereum Foundation is aiming to make this easier for them with the launch of a new website.\nOn Wednesday, the organisation, which helps develop and maintain the Ethereum blockchain, launched the new online resource to help guide firms looking to integrate the blockchain into their businesses.\n\u201cClear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,\u201d a post from the foundation said, adding that the site will help guide businesses adopting Ethereum and showcase how the ecosystem is building a new financial system.\n1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions site\n\u2014 Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 29, 2025\nEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchain\nToday, we\u2019re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0\nThe site highlights institutional use cases for Ethereum, including stablecoins, the tokenisation of real-world assets like bonds, and decentralised financial applications.\nIt also contains statistics on the blockchain\u2019s use, and information on firms like BlackRock, Visa, and eToro, who are already experimenting with Ethereum.\nEthereum is the biggest blockchain for DeFi, with some $118 billion worth of deposits to more than one thousand protocols. It also hosts more than half of the $308 billion stablecoin market.\nBut the blockchain\u2019s stewards \u2014 namely the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation \u2014 have previously faced criticism for not doing enough to support institutional adoption on the blockchain compared to its rivals.\nLand grab\nThe move comes amid a crypto land grab among the paragons of traditional finance who are looking to leverage blockchain technology following landmark legislation being approved this summer.\nOn Tuesday, banking giant Citi announced a partnership with US crypto exchange Coinbase to foster the adoption of stablecoins. The firms plan to build stablecoin on- and off-ramps, streamline settlement, and make digital dollars flow 24/7.\nOver the past week, Zelle and Western Union have also revealed plans to integrate stablecoins into their operations.\nEnterprise push\nSeeing the growing institutional interest, the Ethereum Foundation has sought to make the blockchain more attractive for financial firms looking to integrate the technology.\nLast year, the foundation, along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, funded research into Wall Street\u2019s interest in Ethereum through Etherealize, a startup focused on integrating traditional finance with the blockchain.\n\u201cInstitutions need someone to be the face of the organisation that is representing Ethereum,\u201d Tomasz Sta\u0144czak, one of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s co-directors, told DL News in July.\nEtherealize has bold plans for adoption.\nIn September, CEO Vivek Raman told DL News of his ambition to onboard the $16 trillion mortgage market to Ethereum.\n\u201cThe whole fixed income space of really esoteric objects, such as mortgages, is a huge design space to tokenise those natively,\u201d Raman said.\nIn addition to courting institutions, representatives from Etherealize met with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s crypto task force in May to discuss how the regulator could accommodate tokenisation of stocks and bonds on the blockchain.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi correspondent.

The first vault\u2019s initial cap was 5 BTC, shortly being raised to 50 BTC. The longer-term capacity target for the Re7 strategy is \u201cabout 200 to 300 million,\u201d Wallendal said.\nMidas provides an algorithmic infrastructure and 24/7 portfolio monitoring. Wallendal added that a \u201ckill switch\u201d can pull funds from strategies back to a dispatcher contract, maintained by a 3-of-9 multisig, for user-only redemption in the event of a serious issue.\n14% may sound like a lot, but Wallendal framed Acre\u2019s goal as sustainable, risk-weighted returns rather than chasing the richest emissions. \u201cWe\u2019re not chasing the most degen [yields],\u201d and said a longer-term target is \u201cabove 5% APY overall.\u201d\nThat would put it in line with competing options for bitcoin yield \u2014 a crowded and fast-shifting field. Bitcoin staking via Babylon has stalled and like many venues pays in non-BTC incentives alongside a newer risk surface. Bitcoin L2 ecosystems like Stacks (via sBTC), Hemi and Botanix provide alternatives, each with their own bridging solutions. In principle, Acre could deploy on all of these chains, alongside strategies such as providing liquidity to the Lightning Network.\nIn any case, the end user deposits assets directly from a Bitcoin wallet via the L1, and withdraws back to Bitcoin.\nOn oversight, Acre leans on a nine-member Security Council that sets a deployment policy and vets curators and strategies.\nThe members of the council are not disclosed, but \u201cthere are nine independent members,\u201d Wallendal said, and \u201conly one from the Acre team.\u201d The risk curators do not sit on the council, she added, in a nod to limit conflicts of interest.\nAcre chose tBTC from Threshold Network given its solid track record, decentralization and connections to the founding team.\nThe vault competes largely with centralized exchange-based \u201cearn\u201d products, which are easy to use but introduce counterparty risk and often deliver only modest BTC yields unless paired with structured products. Acre\u2019s differentiation is the promise of onchain transparency, balanced against bridge, smart-contract and incentive-dependence risks.\nWallendal knows the cr"

This is a bold move in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) seeping into traditional finance. It raises some eyebrows on how DeFi will mesh with legacy finance systems, especially with institutional players feeling more confident in crypto assets.\nThe Institutional Custody and DeFi Connection\nInstitutional-grade custody\u2014think regulated custodians, multi-signature controls, robust compliance frameworks\u2014has emerged as a crucial enabler for traditional financial institutions to dip their toes into DeFi waters. Anchorage Digital Bank is stepping into the limelight, providing the necessary security and compliance that institutional investors crave.\nLinea, with its developer-ready zkEVM infrastructure, is designed to utilize zero-knowledge rollups for efficient scaling. The partnership highlights Anchorage Digital Bank\u2019s role as a trusted custodian, adding a layer of institutional credibility that DeFi often lacks.\nWhat's in Store for Smaller Fintech Startups?\nWhile it\u2019s great to see larger players like SharpLink making waves, the landscape isn\u2019t entirely barren for smaller fintech startups. There's space for them to innovate, especially by harnessing blockchain tech to carve out their own niches.\nStartups can look towards stablecoin payroll integration solutions, allowing businesses to pay employees in crypto. This not only enhances financial flexibility but also meets the needs of remote teams and freelancers. Given the growing demand for crypto payroll platforms, startups that can bridge the gap between crypto and existing financial systems could find solid ground.\nRisks and Challenges Ahead\nHowever, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Smaller startups may face challenges in gaining the level of trust, regulatory compliance, and scalability that established entities like Anchorage Digital Bank enjoy. Moreover, the ever-present risks of operational vulnerabilities, regulatory scrutiny, and market volatility could prove to be significant obstacles.\nThe balance between decentralization and institutional involvement is another critical consideration. While institutional-grade custody can add security and compliance, it may also cloud the core principles of DeFi, which prioritize self-sovereignty and the elimination of intermediaries.\nSummary: The Future of DeFi and Traditional Finance Integration\nSharpLink\u2019s $200 million ETH deployment signals a significant shift in DeFi and traditional finance integration. With institutional players warming up to cryptocurrencies, fintech startups must adapt quickly. By focusing on innovative solutions like stablecoin treasury management and crypto payroll integration, there's an opportunity for smaller players to carve out space in this evolving finance landscape.\nThe future will likely see a blend of traditional finance and DeFi, offering a spectrum of opportunities for businesses and investors alike. As the industry matures, insights from SharpLink\u2019s strategy will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons for anyone eager to dive into the complexities of crypto integration."

They are often able to outcompete conventional decentralised exchanges because they can actively manage their liquidity and better defend against malicious trading bots.\nThis lets prop AMMs offer traders cheaper prices on swaps, so exchange aggregators like Jupiter send more trades their way.\n\u201cThese prop AMMs have been, arguably, the most significant change in onchain market microstructure that crypto has seen in years,\u201d Kash Dhanda, Jupiter\u2019s self-described \u201ccat-herder,\u201d said on a livestream in which he revealed HumidiFi\u2019s upcoming ICO. (HumidiFi later confirmed the launch on X.)\n\u201cIt is what allows people to trade onchain at size with prices that are, if not comparable, sometimes even better than what you can get on centralised exchanges.\u201d\nDhanda said HumidiFi had not chosen an exact date for its ICO, but added the event would come in November.\nWET will be the first token to use Jupiter\u2019s Decentralised Token Formation platform, or DTF.\nOn the live stream, Jupiter attorney Yu Kheng Pek said DTF would offer tiered access to would-be investors.\nFirst, the issuer of the token could whitelist certain recipients, such as employees and investors. Second, some tokens would be set aside for Jupiter stakers. Finally, the public would be able to invest at a set price on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\u201cThis kind of goes back to the initial ICO days,\u201d Yew said.\nThe attorney was critical of newer ICO models that cap investments. In the event deposits exceed the cap, issuers often distribute tokens on a pro-rata basis. But that system can be manipulated by deep-pocketed investors, according to Yew.\nWhales who deposit an outsize sum at the last minute, exceeding the cap, know that most of their money will get refunded. But it still counts when measuring their pro-rata distribution, meaning they can secure an outsize share of the newly issued tokens.\n\u201cFirst-come first-served is still the fairest way to do allocations, in my view,\u201d Yew said.\nJupiter\u2019s DTF model distinguishes itself in other ways: Tokens sold to the public will begin trading on Meteora, a Jupiter-affiliated decentralised exchange, the moment the ICO ends. And tokens subject to vesting \u2014 such as those set aside for insiders \u2014 will be locked up onchain, preventing issuers from circumventing their own rules.\nDuring the HumidiFi ICO, JUP stakers will have access to an exclusive pre-sale, according to Dhanda.\n\u201cIf you have your JUP staked, you will be able to get in at a discounted price,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be able to do that for all DTF launches going forward.\u201d\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

Behind the showmanship, Washington and Beijing\u2019s top trade lieutenants have quietly mapped out a framework that might, just might, keep the world\u2019s two largest economies from tearing up the field again,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\nTrump was heading next to Japan before ending his Asian tour in South Korea where he is expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (known as APEC) forum.\nA report by the APEC secretariat released Monday forecast that annual growth in the region circling the Pacific will slow to 3 per cent this year from 3.6 per cent last year, partly due to trade restrictions and higher tariffs.\nIn Japan, opinion polls showed newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enjoying high levels of public support for her market-friendly policies. The Nikkei 225 gained 2.1 per cent to 50,329.08, hitting record intraday highs.\nTakaichi is Japan's first female prime minister. She favors raising defense spending and that has boosted prices of stocks in major defense contractors, such as Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which gained 8.7 per cent. IHI Corp. jumped 2.6 per cent and Hitachi gained 2.7 per cent.\nTrump has long complained American cars were shut out Japanese markets, one of various reasons he cited for imposing tariffs of 25 per cent, then lowered to 15 per cent, on American's most vital ally in Asia. So Japan\u2019s government has floated the idea of buying a fleet of Ford F-150 trucks to use to inspect roads and infrastructure.\nShares jumped in South Korea, where the Kospi was up 2 per cent at 4,018.73, also a record. Investors there are hoping for a trade deal with Trump.\nAdvertisement\nChinese markets likewise saw solid gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1 per cent to 26,427.34, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1 per cent to 3,991.35.\nIn Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 0.3 per cent to 9,047.40.\nTaiwan's Taiex gained 2.1 per cent and the Sensex in India was up 0.5 per cent.\nOn Friday, U.S. stocks hit records after an update on inflation came in a bit less painful than feared.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 6,791.69, topping its prior all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1 per cent to 47,207.12, also a record.\nThe Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1 per cent to a record of 23,204.87.\nThe data on inflation was encouraging because it could mean less pain for lower- and middle-income households struggling with still-high increases in prices. Even more importantly for Wall Street, it could also clear the way for the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving a boost to the slowing job market.\nThe Fed just cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year, but it\u2019s been hesitant to promise more relief because lower rates can make inflation worse, beyond goosing the economy and prices for investments.\nMost big U.S. companies are reporting stronger profits for the latest quarter than analysts expected, also raising hopes for steady growth.\nIn other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude"

                "body": "FTSE 100 Live Today Oct 29, 2025: UK Stock Futures Steady, Pound Falls, Crypto Impact on BTCGBP and ETHGBP\nAccording to @business, FTSE 100 futures were steady while the British pound fell on Oct 29, 2025, as reported in Bloomberg\u2019s live blog tracking UK markets. Source: Bloomberg @business live blog. The blog highlights U.S. tariffs, moves in gold and oil, and UK corporate earnings as key catalysts for intraday trading in UK assets. Source: Bloomberg @business live blog. For crypto traders, GBP weakness mechanically lifts BTCGBP and ETHGBP quotes if USD crypto prices are unchanged due to FX translation. Sources: Bloomberg @business live blog for the GBP move; Bank of England reference rate methodology for FX conversion.\nSourceAnalysis\nThe FTSE 100 index is showing remarkable stability in futures trading amid broader market uncertainties, while the British pound experiences a notable decline, according to recent market updates from financial analysts. This development comes at a time when global investors are closely monitoring UK economic indicators, especially in light of potential tariff impacts and commodity price shifts. For cryptocurrency traders, this scenario presents intriguing cross-market opportunities, as traditional stock movements often influence digital asset sentiment. With the pound falling, safe-haven assets like Bitcoin (BTC) could see increased demand, potentially driving up crypto prices as investors seek alternatives to fiat volatility.\nFTSE 100 Futures Hold Steady Amid Economic Pressures\nUK stock futures for the FTSE 100 have remained steady, defying expectations of volatility driven by external factors such as potential trade tariffs and fluctuating oil and gold prices. This resilience suggests underlying strength in major UK-listed companies, particularly in sectors like energy and mining, which are sensitive to global commodity trends. Trading volumes in FTSE futures have been moderate, with intraday movements staying within a tight range, indicating cautious optimism among institutional investors. From a crypto perspective, this stability in traditional markets could correlate with reduced risk aversion in digital assets. For instance, if FTSE 100 holds above key support levels around 8,200 points, it might encourage bullish flows into Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins, as traders view crypto as a hedge against pound weakness. Historical data shows that during periods of pound depreciation, BTC/USD pairs often experience upward pressure, with average 24-hour gains of 2-3% in similar scenarios, based on past market analyses.\nPound's Decline and Its Ripple Effects on Crypto Trading\nThe pound's fall is a critical element in today's market narrative, dropping against major currencies like the USD and EUR, potentially exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and economic policy announcements. This currency weakness could lead to inflationary pressures in the UK, prompting the Bank of England to consider rate adjustments, which in turn affects global liquidity. For crypto traders, this is a prime opportunity to monitor GBP/BTC trading pairs on exchanges, where increased volatility might offer short-term scalping strategies. On-chain metrics reveal that during recent pound slumps, Bitcoin's trading volume surges by up to 15%, as per blockchain data trackers, signaling heightened interest from UK-based investors diversifying into decentralized assets. Resistance levels for GBP/USD around 1.28 could, if broken, trigger a cascade into crypto markets, pushing ETH prices toward $3,000 thresholds.\nBroader market implications extend to institutional flows, where hedge funds might rotate out of sterling-denominated assets into cryptocurrencies. Gold and oil price dynamics, intertwined with FTSE movements, further amplify this: rising gold prices often parallel BTC rallies, as both are perceived as inflation hedges. Traders should watch for correlations; for example, a steady FTSE 100 amid falling pound could boost sent"

Much of the Fed commentary leading up to today has been dovish, and markets have been flying high on rate cut optimism.\nEither way, investors shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by the U-turn equities took. On average, over the last two years, the S&P 500 has gained anywhere between 0.3% to 0.4% between 2:30 to 3:00 p.m. on the day the Fed announced its decision on interest rates. But the rallies have fizzled out and only averaged a gain of 0.1% by close over the previous day, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\nWhat was startling was the reaction in the bond market. Treasuries sold off across the board, with the 10-year yield rising 0.074 percentage point to 4.056%. It\u2019s the largest gain on a Fed day decision this year, according to the Dow Jones Market Data. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices.\n\u201cThe knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn\u2019t a sure thing,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management. \u201cWe think this will prove to be a buying opportunity because the Fed is likely to continue to support both stock and bond markets by cutting interest rates significantly over the next 12 months (even if they do keep rates unchanged in December).\u201d"

                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a rapid reversal on Wednesday, touching a record high earlier in the session before rolling over after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank might not cut interest rates again in 2025.\nThe blue-chip index closed down 74.37 points, or 0.2%, to 47,632.00, while the S&P 500 ended a handful of points lower to 6,890.59. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, rising 0.55% to a fresh record close of 23,958.47, propped up by a rise in Nvidia. The Dow was up as much as 334 points, touching a new all-time high at one point before turning lower.\nThe Fed lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting Wednesday afternoon, putting it in a range of between 3.75% to 4%. This marks the second time this year that the central bank has slashed rates. Prior to the decision, investors were betting on another quarter-point cut at the Fed's December meeting.\nBut Powell knocked down market expectations after saying that there were \"strongly differing views about how to proceed in December\" during this meeting's committee discussions. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it,\" he said.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield jumped back above 4% on Powell's comments about the December meeting. Stocks that stand to lose from higher rates led the rollover in the market. Consumer stocks like Costco and McDonald's declined. Visa and Mastercard also fell.\nAll in all, Powell did indicate that what to do at the December meeting was still in the air, adding that inflation was not too far from the Fed's target.\n\"Powell is reflecting the tension on the Fed between those who favor more aggressive easing and those who are concerned that inflation remains too high, even as the labor market weakens,\" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments. \"Our view has been that the market has been too aggressive in pricing in the pace and magnitude of future cuts. Inflation is elevated above the Fed's target, and we see monetary policy as moderately loose, with nominal rates below nominal GDP growth.\"\nMegacap technology name Nvidia clung to gains Wednesday, advancing 3.1%. The artificial intelligence chip darling's market capitalization had rocketed up above $5 trillion in the session, the first time a U.S. company reached such a valuation. The stock notched a five-day winning streak as well. The move comes just a day after the company announced an array of new deals, especially one that involves the chip giant taking a $1 billion stake in Finnish networking company Nokia.\nFive fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are set to report this week. They're expected to continue spending on building data centers, but any disappointment from the megacap behemoths could hurt the broader market. Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are due to report after the close on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon post results on Thursday.\nInvestors are additionally awaiting what comes of President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, though trade tensions between the U.S. and China already appear to have alleviated after progress over the weekend. Trump has said that he expects to cut fentanyl-related tariffs on China, which sit at 20%."

After last night [Game 3] and kind of all the recognition that went into Shohei individually and he's on the mound today, it's a huge swing from Vlad. It's a huge swing to get us going. I think that gives [us] some momentum.\"\nGuerrero has been giving the Blue Jays momentum all month, hitting .419 with seven home runs this postseason. But don't just label him a free-swinging slugger. Though that description might fit his famous dad, the younger Guerrero is much, much more -- and his teammates have taken notice throughout the postseason ride.\n'Grabbing some popcorn and watching him do his thing'\nMax Scherzer is a future Hall of Famer pitching in the World Series for a fourth different franchise, and even the 41-year-old right-hander is impressed by what he has seen from Guerrero on a nightly basis.\n\"He's just locked and loaded,\" Scherzer said. \"He's such a force. To me, his greatness is beyond his offense. It's his defense and baserunning too. He's an all-around great player.\"\nBut nothing else Guerrero has done this season compares to the show he has put on with the bat in his hands. Even his hitting coach, David Popkins, often finds himself watching his star like a fan would.\n\"It's pretty much enjoying the show, grabbing some popcorn and watching him do his thing,\" Popkins said with a laugh. \"He's ahead of every adjustment before we can get to him. I learn from him every day.\n\"And when those things click, it's on like Donkey Kong.\"\nIt's a common theme from those playing with him this October.\nCloser Jeff Hoffman said he is \"on the edge of his seat\" every night, waiting for Guerrero to do something special. Sometimes it comes with a big home run to left field and other times it's just shooting the ball the other way for a single, as he also did in Game 4. Guerrero is the embodiment of spraying to all fields.\n\"It's a quality at-bat every time,\" third baseman Ernie Clement said. \"It doesn't have to be a homer. He is battling up there and seeing pitches and just making it really, really hard on the opposing pitchers.\n\"This postseason as a whole is just the most amazing baseball I've ever seen from him. And that's saying something because he hit like .400 in the second half last year. This is the best version of him.\"\n'Helping my team win some games'\nOn the heels of signing a massive $500 million contract that will keep him with the Blue Jays through the 2039 season, many of Guerrero's teammates point to the extra pressure on their superstar's shoulders to deliver this month -- but he just keeps on living up to the expectations.\nHe hit .529 in the division series, .385 in the ALCS and is hitting .368 in the World Series so far. Guerrero was asked what has impressed him most about his own play after his Game 4 home run against Ohtani.\n\"That I am helping my team win some games,\" he responded through the team interpreter. \"That's what I'm impressed with right now.\"\nThe effects of his play were echoed throughout the locker room after the latest in a month of heroics.\n\""

Kennedy Jr., a longtime skeptic of vaccine safety, has given him.\nThat is, he said, to scrutinize the vaccine guidance the government gives to Americans with a skeptical eye.\nKennedy \u201chas said that he is not anti-vax,\u201d Kulldorff said. \u201cHe has many supporters, so I think it\u2019s much better to believe him and trust his words and say, \u2018Well, you may have questions about vaccines, and that\u2019s good.\u2019\u201d\nStill, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 which is now staffed with Kennedy picks \u2014 is hugely influential in setting the vaccine schedule and in informing state requirements for school attendance. Kulldorff said he\u2019s an independent voice, has only met Kennedy twice and doesn\u2019t talk to him regularly.\nSince the Swedish-born Kulldorff became its chair in June, the panel has recommended removing a mercury-containing preservative from certain flu vaccines and limiting the use of a combination measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine to older children. Many who work in public health objected to those changes, are worried there\u2019s more to come and expect the changes will only increase skepticism of vaccines.\nAs ACIP embarks on reviewing the childhood vaccine schedule, Kulldorff \u2014 a former Harvard biostatistician and epidemiologist who rose to national prominence opposing Covid lockdowns \u2014 said scientists should be \u201cmore humble\u201d about what they do and don\u2019t know when it comes to rare vaccine side effects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the question of doing it in a scientific manner so that we have the integrity of the schedule, and then the integrity will lead to the trust,\u201d he said.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat concerns you most now as chair of ACIP?\nIf you look at public health as a whole, the goal \u2014 in politics \u2014 is to get 51 percent support from the population or the public. But in public health, that\u2019s not enough. You need to have way above 90 percent.\nThere\u2019s a need to reestablish both the integrity and trust of public health. And trust is going both ways. If CDC wants to be trusted, CDC also has to trust the public. If you do that, then you have to address not just those people who already trust the CDC or trust the government. You have to address the perspective of those who do not trust the CDC and ask them why is that.\nThe big reason \u2014 a very good reason \u2014 is because CDC was not truthful during the pandemic. They said things that were wrong.\nIs Kennedy and his MAHA movement the solution?\nI think the responsibility to restore the integrity and trust in public health falls on primarily scientists and public health officials. That\u2019s people like me, but also people at the New York City Health Department or people working at CDC and so on.\nIt\u2019s less of a political issue, and it\u2019s more of a societal issue that a lot of what we see going on now is driven by the public who do not trust public health and don\u2019t trust the scientific community.\nWhen the scientific community loses the public\u2019s trust, the public is not going to be in favor of spending money on scientists. So I think the scientific community is shooting itself in the foot.\nYour fellow ACIP member Robert Malone has said he sees his role as \u201cworking to advance the interests\u201d of Kennedy. How do you see your role?\nI\u2019m not going to comment on Robert Malone because he will have "

He did not give further details.\n\"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said of his discussions with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\n\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"\nBoth sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos.\nTrump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which Lee managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.\nBut the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.\nBoth countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.\nTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.\nChina's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju.\nThe US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\n\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"\nThis will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.\nAddressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".\nHe also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\n\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"\nGolden crowns and grand orders\nAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown.\n\"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown.\nHe also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.\nHe's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.\nBoth leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon.\nTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.\nThe US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.\nNoting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".\nAnd outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans.

The Nikkei\u2019s new peak, joined by strong gains in the broader Topix index, signals wide optimism across Japan\u2019s corporate landscape.

                "body": "Japan's central bank on Thursday kept benchmark interest rates steady at 0.5% in its first meeting after Sanae Takaichi took power as the country's prime minister earlier this month.\nThe decision was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes even as inflation has stayed above the central bank's 2% target for 41 months in a row.\nThe Bank of Japan said the decision was split 7-2, with board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata proposing a 25 basis point hike.\nMarket reaction to the expected decision was relatively muted, with Japanese 10-year bond yields little changed, the yen 0.2% weaker at 153.03, while the Nikkei stock index was up 0.4%.\nKrishna Bhimavarapu, APAC Economist at State Street Investment Management, said in a note after the decision that there was an \"increased likelihood\" of a rate hike within the next two policy meetings when global trade-related volatility is better assessed.\n\"Nonetheless, the Bank is still likely to move only gradually in the next year as well,\" she added.\nThis BOJ verdict comes as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday met with Satsuki Katayama, the new finance minister in the Takaichi administration, and appeared to take aim at Tokyo over the yen's weakness, even commenting on the country's monetary policy.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department said that Bessent \"highlighted the important role of sound monetary policy formulation and communication in anchoring inflation expectations and preventing excess exchange rate volatility.\"\nHigher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency by inviting foreign flows, while lower rates tend to weaken it.\nThe weak yen has been a sticking point for the U.S. President Donald Trump, who said in March that Tokyo had weakened its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.\nTrump met with Takaichi, who has been an advocate of lower interest rates and has called BOJ's rate hikes as \"stupid\" in the past.\nWhile Takaichi appears to have softened her stance, this push to strengthen the yen is still at odds of with her plans for massive fiscal spending and a loose monetary policy.\n\"What's most important is for the BOJ and government to coordinate policy and communicate closely,\" Takaichi said on Oct. 21, according to Reuters.\nTakaichi is seen as a proponent of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of the late Shinzo Abe that espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.\nOn Wednesday, Bessent wrote on X that \"the government's willingness to allow the Bank of Japan policy space will be key to anchoring inflation expectations.\"\nKatayama said in March that yen's real value was likely at about 120-130 against the dollar, about 26% stronger than the current level of around 152.\nTakaichi's policies are likely to devalue the yen, according to experts, something that has already happened in the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" that saw the Nikkei 225 hit record levels and the yen weaken beyond the 150 level against the dollar.\nThe BOJ's decision also comes against the backdrop of a relatively weak export landscape. Japan's exports contracted for four straight months, before seeing a rebound in September, although shipments to the U.S. have still been declining."
