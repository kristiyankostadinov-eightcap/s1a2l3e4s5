The US dollar has been hanging near a three-month high, putting pressure on gold, even as December futures crept up just 0.4% to $4,010\u2014still below last month\u2019s peak. Traders now put the odds of another Fed cut in December at 71%, down from over 90% last week, based on CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Easing tensions between the US and China\u2014highlighted by lowered tariffs and new agreements on items like fentanyl and rare earths\u2014have also taken some heat out of gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal. Technical analysts at OANDA see limited room for gold to climb until fresh US economic data gives clearer direction.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A firm dollar keeps the brakes on gold.\nGold\u2019s sluggish performance shows just how much a strong currency can sap demand for alternative assets. Silver edged up 0.2% to $48.75, platinum rose 1.5%, and palladium slipped, but the precious metals market is treading water as shifting interest rate bets and thawing US-China relations cool investor nerves. With fluctuating pricing from the LBMA and Comex, investors are taking a more cautious, selective approach for now.\nThe bigger picture: Tepid trading shapes future expectations.\nFor the rest of 2025, the fate of precious metals is tightly linked to Fed policy, global trade developments, and technical resistance levels. Key US economic reports due this week\u2014like employment and manufacturing data\u2014could quickly reset expectations if they change the Fed\u2019s outlook. And with US-China trade talks taking some tension off the table, gold\u2019s safe-haven status might stay in the background unless new risks emerge.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nRosa Leo \u2022 3 days ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The U.S. has reduced tariff magnitudes, while China has resumed large-scale purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, lifted export controls on rare earths (crucial for semiconductors and EVs), and paused retaliatory measures against U.S. technology firms.\nDespite these constructive developments, oversupply risks heading into 2026 remain a concern for oil markets.

                "body": "EUR/USD weekly forecast | November 3, 2025\nThe EUR/USD currency pair fell last week and it could start the new week on the backfoot. But the downside should be limited with 1.15 support now in sight.\nUS dollar had another good week: Here\u2019s why\nLast week was another good one for the US dollar. The greenback found good support on the back of Fed Chair Powell\u2019s hawkish press conference where he threw caution on a December. What\u2019s more, the US-China trade deal removed a negative source of uncertainty that had weighed on the dollar in the past. Traders were also refusing to short the US dollar because of the simple fact that there was no compelling negative US news. The ongoing government shutdown means crucial data on the jobs market remains missing for the Fed to use in their December rate decision. That being said, it remains to be seen how much the dollar can rebound further, given the lack of data releases.\nEUR/USD forecast: ECB is in a good place\nLast week, the releases of stronger Eurozone GDP and the ECB's \"good place\" rhetoric were not enough to prevent a dollar-driven EUR/USD drop. \u201cFrom a monetary-policy point of view, we are in a good place,\u201d President Christine Lagarde said at the ECB presser last week. \u201cIs it a fixed good place? No, but we will do whatever is needed to make sure that we stay in a good place.\u201d Those words imply the ECB is basically done with rate cuts unless incoming data suggest otherwise. This should keep a floor under the EUR/USD exchange rate.\nWeek ahead: Key data highlights for EUR/USD forecast\nIt is not a super important week from Eurozone data point of view. On Monday we will have the final manufacturing PMI releases from France and Germany. We will hear from Lagarde again on Tuesday. If she does discuss monetary policy, don\u2019t expect any changes from her tone last week. I mean why would you? German factory orders and final services PMIs from Eurozone are the highlights for Wednesday. On Thursday, we will have German industrial production and eurozone retail sales. The last day of the week will feature some trade data.\nFrom the US side of things, well, don\u2019t expect any government data but we will have some private sector data including the ISM PMIs \u2013 manufacturing on Monday and services on Wednesday, as well as ADP private payrolls report on Wednesday. These private sector data releases, especially the ADP report should have a big say in as far as the US dollar\u2019s direction is concerned. That\u2019s because the Fed\u2019s focus has shifted to employment part of its dual mandate and recent weakness here has allowed it to cut rates, most recently last week. A December rate cut could also be on the way unless employment improves markedly and inflation heats up, even if Powell has said that it is not a forgone conclusion.\nTechnical EUR/USD forecast\nFrom a technical perspective, the EUR/USD chart remains range bound but the longer term view remains bullish \u2013 although momentum has been lost. With the EUR/USD closing the week at its lows, expect some further short-term downside initially as the week gets underway. Key short-term support is seen around 1.1500 area now, below which is the August low of 1.1391. Resistance is at 1.1580 and then 1.1600.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

                "body": "EUR/USD outlook: Key data ahead as 1.1600 support snaps \u2014 Is 1.1400 next?\nThe euro has slipped decisively below the 1.1600 handle, a level that\u2019s acted as a crucial technical pivot for months. The move follows a week of broad dollar resilience and renewed repricing in Fed rate expectations \u2014 and it comes just days before a heavy run of U.S. economic data that could dictate the next major swing.\nThe macro setup: All eyes on ISM and Michigan sentiment\nNext week\u2019s U.S. calendar is packed with data that could reshape near-term dollar sentiment:\n- Monday, Nov 3: ISM Manufacturing PMI (Oct) \u2014 expected near 49.0, signaling continued contraction.\n- Wednesday, Nov 5: ISM Services PMI \u2014 seen improving slightly to 51.0 from 50.0.\n- Friday, Nov 7: University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment (prelim, Nov) \u2014 forecast to tick up toward 54\u201356 from 53.6.\nThese reports are key because markets have recently scaled back expectations of early 2026 Fed rate cuts. Strong U.S. data would reinforce that view and push the dollar higher, while any signs of cooling activity could offer the euro a temporary reprieve.\nTechnical breakdown: Bears in control below 1.1600\nFrom a chart perspective, EUR/USD has broken beneath 1.1600, confirming a downside continuation within a short-term descending channel. Price action shows a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, reinforcing a bearish structure.\nThe pair briefly consolidated near the 1.1600 zone, but sellers regained control as dollar demand strengthened. If this level now acts as resistance, the next major downside target emerges at 1.1450\u20131.1400, an area of historical demand visible on the weekly timeframe.\nThat zone could attract buyers, but unless macro fundamentals shift, momentum favours the bears.\nWhat to watch inside the data\n- In the ISM Manufacturing, keep an eye on New Orders and Prices Paid \u2014 any surge here would signal sticky inflation.\n- In the ISM Services, Employment and Business Activity will show whether domestic demand remains firm.\n- The Michigan survey\u2019s inflation expectations could easily swing Fed rhetoric \u2014 and the USD \u2014 for the rest of November.\nOutlook summary\nEUR/USD sits at a critical juncture just as the data calendar heats up.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to show resilience, the recent break below 1.1600 may evolve into a broader downtrend, with 1.1400 the next logical destination.\nOnly a dovish shift from the Fed or clear evidence of U.S. slowdown would be enough to turn this tide \u2014 for now, the path of least resistance remains lower.\nAuthor\nZorrays Junaid\nAlchemy Markets\nZorrays Junaid has extensive combined experience in the financial markets as a portfolio manager and trading coach.

The annual CPI inflation came in softer than the market forecast of 3.1%.\nFollowing the softer-than-expected US inflation data, markets almost fully priced in two interest rate reductions this year, with a 25 basis points (bps) cut each in the October and December monetary policy meetings.\nThis Greenback weakness helped GBP/USD buyers gather some courage to briefly regain the 1.3350 barrier.\nHowever, the pair quickly reversed course and resumed its downtrend after the US Dollar staged a solid comeback against its six major currency rivals on Wednesday, even as the Fed delivered on the expected 25 bps cut.\nThe rebound occurred because, during the post-policy meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Powell noted that policymakers are likely to become more cautious if the current government shutdown deprives them of further job and inflation reports, tempering bets for another rate cut by the Fed at year-end.\nFollowing the Fed event, the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool showed a 72.8% probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut in December compared with a 91.1% chance a week earlier.\nInvestors remained nervous heading into Thursday\u2019s highly anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea, exerting additional downside pressure on the higher-yielding Pound Sterling.\nOn Thursday, both leaders reached a major trade truce on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Busan, South Korea. The landmark agreement covers key critical points, including rare earth minerals, fentanyl trade, and semiconductor sales.\nTrump said that \u201ctariffs on China will be 47% down from 57%.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry confirmed that Beijing will pause rare earth export controls for a year, adding that \u201cboth sides reached consensus on fentanyl cooperation, expanding agriculture trade.\u201d\nThe US-China trade deal optimism provided extra legs to the USD upswing, in the aftermath of a less dovish Fed, exacerbating GBP/USD\u2019s pain. The currency pair breached critical support levels to reach six-month lows near 1.3115.\nOn the UK side of the equation, the Pound Sterling faced additional headwinds as investors grew increasingly anxious ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s Autumn Budget, due on November 26.\nReuters reported that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to lower productivity forecasts, raising financial stress and boding ill for the British Pound.\nThe GBP was also undermined by the markets\u2019 beliefs that mounting concerns over UK economic growth prospects could persuade the Bank of England (BoE) to resume its easing cycle in December after a rates-on-hold decision expected on Thursday.\nUS ADP jobs data, US ISM PMIs and BoE verdict grab eyeballs\nWith the Fed event and the Trump-Xi meeting f"

The US dollar was boosted as Fed Chair Powell expressed uncertainty about a December rate cut, cautioning the markets.\n-Are you interested in learning about the best AI trading forex brokers?

Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Bostic noted the conflict between the dual mandates of price stability and employment.\nOn the UK side, the pound was subdued as the markets grappled with the UK\u2019s fiscal situation. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) lowered the productivity forecast by 0.3%, aiming for a potential \u00a321 billion increase in the budget deficit by 2030.\nMeanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated a fiscal gap of \u00a322 billion. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pressured to increase taxes or borrow more in the November budget to curb this. The investor sentiment dampened slightly due to Reeve\u2019s position. However, PM Keir Starmer backed her, easing the situation.

                "body": "The market widely expects the Bank of England to pause its rate cuts on Thursday (November 6), further slowing the pace of its quarterly monetary easing that has been maintained for over a year.\nInvestors and economists anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will keep interest rates unchanged at 4%. Currently, the UK inflation rate is nearly double its 2% target, and the upcoming Autumn Budget announcement on November 26 is also imminent.\nA decision to maintain borrowing costs will break the pattern of the Bank of England cutting rates at every other meeting since August 2024, contrasting sharply with the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy easing last Wednesday.\nHowever, this pause may only be temporary. After weaker-than-expected data on inflation, employment, and output, traders have increased their bets on a Bank of England rate cut in December. Although investors still see little chance of a rate cut on Thursday, the probability of a rate reduction on December 18 has risen to nearly 60%.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned that the timing of the next rate cut remains uncertain, especially as the monetary policy meeting on Thursday occurs just three weeks before Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves unveils her crucial budget.\nAfter raising employer payroll taxes in April, Reeves was criticized for driving up food costs. Another round of significant tax hikes\u2014this time potentially targeting households\u2014could further dampen an already sluggish economy.\nA series of weaker-than-expected data in recent weeks has added more uncertainty to the outcome of this week\u2019s meeting. While a rate cut remains possible, the market believes the likelihood of maintaining the current rate is higher, given that interest rates are already near neutral levels and inflation remains nearly double the Bank of England\u2019s target.\nBefore implementing further easing measures, the central bank must first clarify the framework of the budget. The market remains convinced that rates will not be lowered again until the Bank of England observes a clear downward trend in inflation data, which is unlikely to occur until April of next year.\nHowever, the risks are tilted towards an earlier interest rate cut \u2014 possibly as soon as February next year, or even December this year.\nMeanwhile, central banks from Australia to Sweden to Brazil are expected to keep interest rates unchanged, while Mexican officials may announce a rate cut.\nThe U.S. government shutdown may continue to affect the release of local economic data. As the shutdown enters its 33rd day, it is on track to become the longest in U.S. history, with the impact on American households intensifying. Against this backdrop, Democratic senators have again urged President Trump to engage directly in negotiations to end the government shutdown.\nMeanwhile, investors will closely monitor whether there are further signs of easing trade frictions.\nBank of England Governor Bailey Must Clarify His Stance Soon: Hawkish or Dovish\nBailey is seen as the pivotal swing vote on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is currently split into two camps: four hawkish officials opposing further rate cuts and four dovish policymakers eager to maintain expectations of monetary easing.\nThe divergence reflects differing views on whether the surge in inflation to nearly twice the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target could lead to persistent price pressures, making any attempt to lower borrowing costs excessively risky. Bailey's two deputies, Sarah Breeden and Dave Ramsden, have downplayed this threat in recent weeks, suggesting that underlying inflation remains on a controllable path.\nExpectations related to the Autumn Budget, to be presented by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on November 26, three weeks after the meeting, are also seen as a key guide for the committee.\nIn recent remarks, Bailey struck a very delicate balance. He indicated that interest rates, which influence borrowing costs for mill"

The AUD/USD pair may continue to lose ground as the US Dollar (USD) gains amid dampening expectations of a US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut in December.\nThe AUD failed to draw any impact from the release of economic data from Australia and China on Monday. The TD-MI Inflation Gauge rose 0.3% month-on-month (MoM) in October, easing slightly from a 0.4% gain in September but marking the second consecutive monthly increase.

This marked the fourth straight monthly decline.\nChina's RatingDog Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 50.6 in October from 51.2 in September. The market forecast was for a 50.9 print. It is important to note that any shift in China\u2019s economic conditions could also affect the Australian dollar (AUD), given the close trade ties between China and Australia.\nUS President Donald Trump said he plans to block China from accessing Nvidia\u2019s most advanced semiconductor technology, according to CBS News. His remarks could reignite US-China trade tensions, which had eased after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last Thursday during the APEC Summit in South Korea.\nTraders turned cautious ahead of Tuesday\u2019s RBA policy decision, with the bank expected to hold rates after three earlier cuts, as Q2 headline and trimmed mean inflation stayed within the 2\u20133% target range.\nUS Dollar gains ground due to weakening likelihood of Fed rate cuts\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar (USD) against six major currencies, is gaining ground and trading around 99.80 at the time of writing. The US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report is due later on Monday.\n- Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in a 69% chance of a cut in December, down from 93% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n- Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during the post-meeting press conference that another rate cut in December is far from certain. Powell also cautioned that policymakers may need to take a wait-and-see approach until official data reporting resumes.\n- The US Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%\u20134.0% in a 10\u20132 vote. The decision was not unanimous, as Fed Governor Stephen Miran supported a larger 50-basis-point cut, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted to keep rates unchanged.\n- Traders may adopt caution due to the prolonged government shutdown, which could fuel economic concerns in the United States (US). The US government impasse has now entered its sixth week with no easy endgame in sight amid a deadlock in Congress on the Republican-backed funding bill.\n- China\u2019s NBS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped sharply to 49.0 in October, following 49.8 recorded in September.

However, a more hawkish Powell dampened expectations of a Dec. Fed rate cut which left AUD/USD stalling in the mid 0.65s. The Australian dollar opens the week pedalling near 0.6550, patiently waiting for clues over tomorrow's RBA meeting and updated SOMP which will headline calendars this week.\nThe week ahead also features NZ Q3 employment data, global PMIs, BoE rate decision and commencement of the US Supreme Court hearing on Trump's tarrifs.\nAustralian Q3 CPI beats forecasts, Trump-Xi shake hands\nPresident's Trump and Xi met on the sidelines of the APEC leaders' summit sidelines last week during which a preliminary trade pact was reached, including (not exhaustively) the following actions:\nChina suspending the recent export controls announced Oct. 9, 2025 and issuing general license fo rare earth exports (nullifying export controls imposed in April 2025 and Oct 2024).\nUS lowering reciprocal tariff rate on China to 10% from 20% and maintain suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs for 1 year (effective 10 Nov, 2025).\nChina taking measures to end fentanyl flows into America.\nChina increasing US soybean purchases; 12mmt in remainder of 2025, 25mmt over next 3 years.\nChina suspending retaliatory tariffs announced since March 4, 2025.\nWhile US-China negotiations are far from complete, a more de-escalatory path forward between the two nations trims a lot of risks for AUD.\nDomestically, Q3 trimmed CPI came in hotter-than-expected printing at 1% (vs exp 0.8%), largely driven by higher electricity, transport and recreation and culture prices. This saw RBA rate cut pricing for Nov. dialled right back to 0 chance from -9bp, with markets currently pricing the next full cut by Feb. 2026. The Australian dollar traded to multi-week highs at 0.6618 following the print.\nThe FOMC delivered a 25bp cut as expected, however a relatively more hawkish Powell saw December Fed rate cut expectations dampened, triggering a broad USD rebound which stifled some of AUD/USD's positive momentum, however 0.6530 held up over the week.\nIn other news, the BoJ and ECB left rates on hold meanwhile the BoC delivered a 25bp cut. Despite Japan's newly elected government signalling a more hands-off approach to the BoJ, Governor Ueda commented last week that the central bank didn't risk falling behind the curve following its decision to keep rates on hold which markets took as inherently dovish. USD/JPY slumped to an 8-month low following the news.\nAUD was broadly stronger on the crosses following hotter CPI figures and positive China headline; AUD/GBP reached YTD highs just above 0.50 amid souring UK political sentiment with difficult fiscal choices ahead at the upcoming Autumn budget. AUD/JPY is up 1.22% above 100.0 on the back of a more dovish Ueda vs expectations of a more hawkish Bullock tomorrow in light of Q3 CPI. AUD/NZD lifted 0.94% to 2-year highs near 1.1450 - markets expect this week's NZ employment to show further softening.\nUS equities and bond yields boosted by hawkish Powell\nUS equities finished the week marginally higher with the S&P500 up 0.7% over the last 5 days following improved sentiment around the US-China bilateral relationship. US 10-year yields jumped around 7bp to 4.07% following the hawkish cut delivered by the Fed, however markets remain vigilant to the risks around an extended US govt. shutdown and delayed tariff pass through.\nGold has fallen almost 8.4% si"

Traders remain uncertain about the timing of the next rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) amid speculations that Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will pursue aggressive fiscal spending plans and resist policy tightening. This, to a larger extent, overshadows strong consumer inflation figures from Tokyo \u2013 Japan's capital city \u2013 released on Friday and continues to weigh on the JPY.\nMoreover, the upbeat mood across the global financial markets is seen undermining the JPY's safe-haven status. The USD, on the other hand, stands firm near its highest level since early August and seems poised to climb further in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) hawkish tilt, lending additional support to the USD/JPY pair. However, concerns about economic risks stemming from a prolonged US government shutdown and speculations that Japanese authorities could intervene to stem further JPY weakness keep a lid on the currency pair amid a holiday in Japan.\nJapanese Yen struggles to lure buyers amid fiscal concerns and BoJ uncertainty\n- The Bank of Japan held rates steady last Thursday despite two dissenting votes, with board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata pushing for a hike to 0.75%. In the post-meeting press conference, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that there are no preset ideas about the timing of the next rate hike.\n- Moreover, Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has a pro-stimulus stance, advocating for significant fiscal spending to tackle inflation and boost the economy. This reaffirms expectations that the BoJ could delay raising interest rates further and continues to undermine the Japanese Yen on Monday.\n- Meanwhile, traders trimmed their bets for another interest rate cut by the US central bank in December following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments last Wednesday. This assists the US Dollar to stand firm near a three-month peak and further acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair.\n- US President Donald Trump again urged Republican senators to scrap the filibuster rule in the Senate as the US government shutdown enters Day 33 on Monday amid a deadlock in Congress. This, however, does little to dent the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding the USD or the currency pair.\n- Trump said on Sunday that, for now, he is not considering a deal that would allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia. This, along with the optimism over the de-escalation of US-China trade tensions, undermines the JPY's safe-haven status and favors the USD/JPY bulls.\n- Traders now look forward to the US economic docket \u2013 featuring the release of the ISM Manufacturing PMI. Apart from this, comments from influential FOMC members would play a key role in driving the USD demand and providing some impetus to the currency pair later during the North American session.\nUSD/JPY seems poised to climb further; breakout through 153.25-153.30 remains in play\nFrom a technical perspective, last week's breakout through the 153.25-153.30 hurdle, and a subsequent strength beyond the 154.00 mark, was seen as a key trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding comfortably in positive territory and are still away from being in the overbought zone. This, in turn, backs the case for a move towards the 154.75-154.80 intermediate hurdle en route to the 155.00 psychological mark.\nOn the flip side, any corrective pullback below the 154.00 mark is likely to find decent suppo"

The move reflects widening policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, reinforced by Tokyo\u2019s political sensitivity to imported inflation and a fresh wave of speculation over direct market intervention. The pair ended the week at 154.004, gaining 0.74%, marking its highest weekly close since January 27. The yen\u2019s weakness intensified despite hotter Tokyo inflation, underscoring that the BoJ\u2019s 0.5% rate remains insufficient to attract capital inflows.\nFed Policy Tightens the Grip on USD/JPY Momentum\nFed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s late October statement dismantled market expectations for a December rate cut, pushing U.S. yields higher and reigniting dollar demand. The Fed\u2019s decision to hold the benchmark rate and caution that cuts are \u201cnot a given\u201d triggered an upward reset in U.S. Treasury yields, especially the 10-year, which sits near 4.35%. The shift recalibrated risk premiums and boosted the USD/JPY (USDJPY=X) pair, as carry traders re-entered dollar-long positions. Traders now price only a 63% chance of a December cut versus 90% a week earlier, signaling the dollar\u2019s rate advantage is firmly intact.\nBoJ\u2019s Reluctance and Japan\u2019s Economic Constraints\nThe Bank of Japan once again left its benchmark rate at 0.5%, even as inflation pressures build domestically. Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the bank needs \u201cmore time\u201d to evaluate wage and price data, referencing companies\u2019 slower pay increases amid 15% tariff pressures on exports. Japan\u2019s Manufacturing PMI slipped from 48.5 to 48.3, while Services PMI fell from 53.3 to 52.4, both hinting at weakening domestic demand. Wage growth also stalled, with average cash earnings up only 1.6% year-on-year versus July\u2019s 3.4% surge. These metrics reinforce the BoJ\u2019s dovish stance \u2014 one that continues to suppress yen demand even as real inflation remains sticky.\nJapan\u2019s Intervention Playbook and Political Crossfire\nAs USD/JPY edges toward 155.00, Tokyo\u2019s financial corridors have reawakened with talk of intervention. Finance Minister Katayama issued a pointed warning that \u201cpatience has limits,\u201d echoing Japan\u2019s previous defense operations at 155 in October 2022 and 160 in May 2024. Those interventions were triggered by monthly yen depreciations exceeding 4\u20135%, a rhythm now repeating. Intervention is a blunt instrument \u2014 costly and often short-lived \u2014 but politically unavoidable as the yen\u2019s weakness becomes a public flashpoint amid rising import prices. Tokyo\u2019s Ministry of Finance holds approximately $1.1 trillion in reserves, yet the timing of its moves has historically aimed for psychological impact, using stealth operations around round numbers to amplify market uncertainty.\nTariffs, Wages, and Trade Flows Tighten Policy Divergence\nU.S. trade tariffs on Japanese industrial exports continue to squeeze profit margins, forcing Japanese firms to trim wage growth. Lower wages reduce domestic consumption and curb inflation momentum, undermining the BoJ\u2019s long-stated goal of achieving a self-sustaining inflation cycle. The yen\u2019s depreciation, while supporting exporters, has simultaneously elevated import costs, particularly in energy. With Brent crude trading near $84.10 per barrel, Japan\u2019s import bill has surged over 18% year-on-year, directly eroding consumer purchasing power. That dynamic creates the paradox driving USD/JPY (USDJPY=X) higher \u2014 a weak currency meant to stimulate exports is now a political liability.\nTechnical Structure and Key Levels in USD/JPY (USDJPY=X)\nThe pair rem"

The Japanese Yen (JPY) softens against the US Dollar (USD) as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) disappointed traders hoping for a more hawkish stance on future rate hikes. The US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report is due later on Monday.\nThe BoJ held its interest rate steady at 0.5% at its October meeting last week. It's the sixth consecutive meeting that the Japanese central bank has maintained the same level since a rate hike in January. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that the central bank wants to gather more information on how the initial momentum of the 2026 shunto will be before deciding to raise the policy rate.\nUeda avoided discussing the specific timing of a possible rate hike, however, saying the BoJ has \"no prejudgment about whether and when to raise the policy rate.\u201d His less hawkish tone on future rate hikes weighs on the JPY and creates a tailwind for the pair.\nOn the USD\u2019s front, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) dampens expectations for a December rate cut, which provides some support to the Greenback. The Fed lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate for the second time this year to a range of 3.75%-4.0%.\nNonetheless, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in nearly a 63% chance of a cut in December, down from 93% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThe US government shutdown has now entered its sixth week with no easy endgame in sight amid a deadlock in Congress on the Republican-backed funding bill. A prolonged federal shutdown could fuel economic concerns and drag the USD lower against the JPY in the near term.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

The pair struggles as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) gains ground on higher Oil prices. It is important to note that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price holds gain around $61.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices appreciate as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) signaled a pause in output increase. OPEC+ on Sunday said it planned to pause output increases in the first quarter (Q1) of 2026, following another modest hike for next month.\nHowever, the USD/CAD pair may regain its ground and continues its winning streak for the third consecutive session as the US Dollar (USD) receives support from dampening expectations for a December rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), following the central bank\u2019s decision of lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate for the second time this year to a range of 3.75%-4.0%.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said during the post-meeting press conference that another rate cut in December is far from certain. Powell also cautioned that policymakers may need to take a wait-and-see approach until official data reporting resumes. Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in a 69% chance of a cut in December, down from 93% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nHowever, traders may adopt caution due to the prolonged government shutdown, which could fuel economic concerns in the United States (US). The US government impasse has now entered its sixth week with no easy endgame in sight amid a deadlock in Congress on the Republican-backed funding bill.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts m"

                "body": "GBP/JPY steadies around mid-202.00s amid BoJ uncertainty; UK fiscal concerns cap gains\n- GBP/JPY reverses a modest Asian session dip as BoJ uncertainty continues to underpin the JPY.\n- The UK\u2019s fiscal concerns and BoE rate hike bets might cap any meaningful appreciation for the GBP.\n- Traders might also opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the latest BoE policy update on Thursday.\nThe GBP/JPY cross attracts some buyers near the 202.30-202.25 area during the Asian session on Monday, though it lacks follow-through. Spot prices remain confined in Friday's broader range and currently trade around mid-202.00s, nearly unchanged for the day amid relatively thin liquidity on the back of a holiday in Japan.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to be undermined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike uncertainty and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross. Investors seem convinced that the BoJ could resist further policy tightening amid speculations that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will pursue aggressive fiscal spending plans. Moreover, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that there are no preset ideas about the timing of the next rate hike. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment across the global financial markets, keeps the safe-haven JPY depressed at the start of a new week.\nAny meaningful JPY depreciation, however, seems limited in the wake of fears that government authorities could intervene to stem further weakness in the domestic currency. Apart from this, concerns about the UK's fiscal situation ahead of Finance Minister Rachel Reeves' Autumn budget on November 26 might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the British Pound (GBP). This, along with expectations for more rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE), contributes to capping the GBP/JPY cross, warranting some caution before positioning for a further upside ahead of the key central bank event risk.\nThe BoE is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday amid a 1-in-3 chance of a 25 bps rate cut and a roughly 68% probability of a rate reduction by the year-end. Softer inflation and fiscal headwinds provide a greater scope to ease policy. Moreover, a further softening in wage growth and a rise in unemployment revived bets on an imminent rate cut. Hence, the outlook will play a key role in influencing the near-term GBP price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/JPY cross. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop suggests that any subsequent move up is likely to be sold into.\nJapanese Yen Price Last 7 Days\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies last 7 days. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

                "body": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF Inflows Surge to $931 Million as Institutional Demand Reignites Momentum Toward $140,000\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) continues to dominate the digital asset landscape, with ETF inflows reaching $931 million in the last week of October \u2014 marking one of the strongest institutional accumulation waves since the Federal Reserve initiated its latest monetary easing cycle. The renewed capital surge has pushed year-to-date ETF inflows to $30.2 billion, with total assets under management in digital asset funds surpassing $229 billion, according to multiple asset tracking firms.\nThe rally comes as Bitcoin holds near $110,036, up 0.03%, despite broader market volatility and persistent global macroeconomic uncertainty. ETF-driven buying has offset profit-taking from large wallets and miner-related supply increases, positioning Bitcoin for potential upside toward $140,000 should current momentum sustain into mid-November.\nInstitutional Capital Returns: ETF Inflows Dominate Market Volume\nThe week\u2019s ETF inflows confirm a sharp reversal from the $513 million outflows recorded in mid-October, signaling a renewed institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure amid softer inflation and improving rate expectations. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs accounted for $446.3 million of the total inflows, led by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone captured $324.3 million in net new funds.\nGermany-based crypto funds followed with $502 million in fresh inflows \u2014 their largest since mid-2024 \u2014 while Swiss-based products saw $329 million in outflows, primarily due to asset transfers between issuers rather than selling. Global trading volume for all digital asset ETFs reached $39 billion, far above the 2025 average of $28 billion, highlighting a significant resurgence in liquidity across crypto-linked financial products.\nMacro Tailwinds: Fed Rate Cuts and Inflation Data Drive Renewed Confidence\nBitcoin\u2019s latest ETF inflow cycle aligns closely with macroeconomic developments. Following the U.S. CPI\u2019s 0.3% monthly rise in September and the annual inflation rate at 3%, investors interpreted the data as confirmation of easing price pressures. This has fueled speculation of two potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in Q4 2025, creating a more favorable liquidity backdrop for risk assets.\nAnalysts from leading crypto exchanges have modeled a $10\u2013$15 billion ETF inflow potential for Q4, projecting Bitcoin could reach $140,000 if cumulative fund entries continue at the current pace. The combination of falling yields, a softer dollar, and institutional reallocations from equities into Bitcoin-linked ETFs forms a powerful macro narrative for sustained upside.\nThe \u201cMoney Vessel\u201d Effect: $8 Billion On-Chain Expansion Signals Real Demand\nOn-chain metrics further reinforce the institutional inflow narrative. Over the past week, Bitcoin\u2019s realized cap \u2014 the aggregate dollar value of coins at their last moved price \u2014 rose by $8 billion to $1.1 trillion, indicating a significant increase in cost basis from new entrants. This inflow reflects tangible capital commitment rather than speculative volume, suggesting deep-pocket investors are layering positions during consolidation around the $110,000 region.\nThe rise in realized price above $110,000 validates consistent buying pressure from treasury firms and exchange-traded vehicles. CryptoQuant data attributes this inflow primarily to ETF-related accumulation and corporate purchases from MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which remains one of the largest institutional holders. The firm\u2019s balance sheet strategy has influenced broader treasury participation trends, though analysts note MicroStrategy\u2019s recent slowdown in purchases may be temporarily capping Bitcoin\u2019s acceleration.\nMiners Expand Operations as Hashrate Surges \u2014 A Long-Term Bullish Signal\nThe mining sector is reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s structural strength. The global hashrate continues to climb, with major operators such as American Bitcoin \u2014 partially linked to "

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem continues to lead in the smart contract race, creating a new wave of ERC-20 tokens that capture much of the investors\u2019 attention. Among them, Shiba Inu keeps its place, using the impressive community of more than 1.5 million holders to stay relevant despite the turbulent markets. Its support around $0.00001000 has been resistant, and although short-term rallies face resistance at $0.00001121, SHIB\u2019s long-term momentum remains appealing for speculative investors in search of growth.\nThe other token is Pepe, which is showing strong accumulation with a rapidly growing holder base. According to analysts, the on-chain activity of PEPE and higher lows are bullish signals, making it a top pick for anyone looking for the next meme-driven breakout.\nHowever, the most compelling opportunity may lie in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.035 during Phase 6 of its presale. MUTM\u2019s dual-lending DeFi model combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, providing real financial utility alongside the excitement of early-stage growth. Many analysts now view MUTM as the best crypto to watch within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem for November 2025, offering both upside potential and sustainable DeFi innovation for investors aiming to diversify beyond meme coins. This combination positions Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptocurrencies leading the market momentum this year.\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is setting up for a possible breakout following several months of consolidation. A bullish pattern in price has formed, and momentum is building slowly. If support holds, then SHIB could be targeting the next resistance around 0.00001300. Traders will need to keep a very close eye on sentiment now, along with events that could lead to volatility, which may mark the next few hours as critical for confirmation of this upward move. Proper risk management remains key, but this setup currently suggests promising potential for investors keeping an eye on Ethereum-based meme coins.\nWhile SHIB is high in momentum, built on a grassroots-style community movement, many investors are equally looking toward emerging DeFi projects with early-stage growth potential and the likes of Mutuum Finance, which is gaining momentum quickly and attracting the attention of traders in pursuit of the next breakout altcoin. As one of the best crypto assets gaining exposure, it is increasingly being recognized within discussions of top cryptocurrencies to hold for 2025.\nPepe Coin Demonstrates First Signs of Stabilization\nPEPE has been in a downtrend for a while, but the recent action shows that the token is finding stability close to its lower support zone. If this level can sustain and buying momentum returns, PEPE may bounce up toward 0.0000080\u20130.00001000, indicating a possible short-term recovery. Traders are closely watching as the market is positioning for a possible near recovery move.\nWhile PEPE\u2019s stabilization attracts community interest, for investors looking to combine DeFi utility with early-stage growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly seen as a more convincing alternative. This further reinforces why Mutuum Finance is considered the best crypto and remains part of the top cryptocurrencies in the upcoming bull cycle.\nA New Generation of DeFi\nMUTM is gradually but steadily turning out to be one of the most innovative and energetic cryptocurrency projects in the DeFi space. With its ongoing presale, it has already attracted over 17,660 investors and gathered more than $18.35 million, way above early expectations. Such a remarkable performance has made it a target for both investors and analysts, who eye it as a hot contender for short-term gains and long-term stability.\nThe early adopters expect returns of almost 2x since the first round of the MUTM presale. Each presale round has swiftly sold out, indicating tremendous investor confidence and laying a sound base of early liquidity in advance of the mainnet launch. This supports the co"

                "body": "During most of the bull cycles, conversations revolve around large coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). However, this time around, a quiet yet radical shift is underway. Whales are shifting their focus from large coins to Digitap ($TAP), an omni-bank ecosystem.\nDigitap is built to blend crypto payments with fiat banking and global settlement. On that note, $TAP\u2019s presale has raised over $1.3 million, and whales are taking their early positions ready for mass adoption.\nBeing the first omni-bank globally, analysts see $TAP as the potential next 100x DeFi gem. They suggest it could outperform ETH and SOL in this bull cycle. Thus, $TAP is the best cryptocurrency to buy right now.\nWhile Ethereum remains a major operator in the blockchain ecosystem, investor confidence in ETH is fading. Notably, Ethereum ETF inflows have stalled since mid-August, with critical metrics showing reduced whale appetite. The slowdown coincides with broader market pressure, which caused $832 million in total liquidations.\nOn the other hand, on-chain analyst Ai Aunt highlighted that another whale dumped 1,531 ETH worth about $5.65 million. This large investor exited the market after holding for two weeks, incurring a loss of $617,000.\nThese incidents show that institutional investors and whales are reassessing risk. Most are moving away due to the fading speculative appetite surrounding Ethereum's complex valuation.\nOn that note, ETH was trading near $3,892 on October 31, 2025, down 1% in the past week. While ETH struggles, whales have turned their attention to $TAP in its presale due to its huge growth potential. They consider it the best ICO crypto to buy now.\nOn October 29, 2025, Fidelity filed Amendment No. 4 to its Form S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing highlighted that custodians like Anchorage Digital Bank, Coinbase Custody, and BitGo Trust will hold the underlying assets.\nAdditionally, Western Union said it will launch a stablecoin via the Solana blockchain in 2026. This move could help more institutional investors move into the SOL space.\nDespite positive developments in its ecosystem, a whale that acquired SOL four years ago continued to send coins to exchanges. The transfer of 515,000 SOL, worth around $93 million, occurred on the Binance exchange in the past four months. However, the whale still holds 828,000 SOL worth $150 million.\nSOL was trading at $185 on October 31, having lost nearly 3% in the past week. While Solana struggles with uncertainties, whales keep buying $TAP rapidly in its presale due to its massive growth potential.\nWith ETH and SOL seemingly overvalued, $TAP emerges as the best investment option offering a strong bullish case in 2025. Digitap is the ecosystem that most whales believe could deliver the next wave of crypto market growth.\nIts omni-bank ecosystem offers users a full financial stack of tools in one app, helping turn crypto into a spendable balance globally. Thus, Digitap delivers the much-needed connectivity in the financial sector.\nUsers can store crypto and fiat in one wallet and use tap-to-pay cards connected to Visa, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. The direct fiat-crypto interoperability explains why experts are bullish about $TAP\u2019s future.\n$TAP\u2019s massive growth potential explains why whales are buying into its presale while avoiding larger tokens affected by momentum fatigue.\nUnlike many of the tokens that exist in the market that are speculative, Digitap offers infrastructural utility for daily money transactions. Users can spend, send, and convert crypto/fiat seamlessly. Thus, the utility-first model makes $TAP rank as the next DeFi gem with 100x growth potential.\nDigitap is well-positioned in the payments and banking trillion-dollar space, which explains the growing interest from whales. If even a small percentage of that value flows through its ecosystem, $TAP\u2019s value could grow considerably.\nWhenever whales move away from established tokens like ETH an"

                "body": "The spotlight on Solana (SOL) continues to intensify as analysts evaluate whether this high-speed smart-contract platform can make a meaningful leap toward $300 by 2026. With growing adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain infrastructure, Solana has the fundamentals to support a major move. At the same time, the market is quietly shifting its attention to early-stage opportunities -- and one token in particular is emerging as the standout for 2025. That token is AlphaPepe (ALPE), a BNB Chain-based meme-coin presale that analysts now regard as the best crypto to buy now.\nSolana's technical performance and ecosystem expansion are often cited as the key reasons for bullish forecasts. Among recent price-predictions, some expect SOL to challenge the $300 area by 2026, supported by institutional interest, its low-fee/ high-throughput network, and increased memecoin activity on the Solana platform.\nOthers take a more conservative view: estimates vary, targeting between roughly $215 and $300 for 2026 depending on market sentiment and adoption levels. While consensus is supportive, the near-term upside for SOL is considered moderate compared with earlier cycles, owing to its already large market cap and increasingly crowded competition in the Layer-1 space.\nTo reach the $300 level, Solana would need to sustain broad ecosystem growth, avoid major outages, and secure fresh institutional inflows amid rising regulatory clarity. For many investors, SOL remains a strong medium-term play -- but not necessarily the highest-growth option for those seeking explosive returns.\nWhile Solana continues to gain recognition, AlphaPepe is capturing early-stage investor attention for several key reasons. Built on the BNB Chain, AlphaPepe combines the viral appeal of meme coins with investor-focused mechanics and transparency that many presales lack.\nAlphaPepe's current presale price is approximately $0.00722, offering a ground-floor entry ahead of its confirmed listing target. Unlike many presales that delay token delivery, AlphaPepe sends tokens instantly to purchasers, which builds trust and immediate proof of ownership.\nThe project includes staking rewards live during the presale, along with USDT reward pools and NFT incentives for top holders -- features designed to attract long-term participation rather than speculative flipping. Its audit credentials are strong: a perfect 10/10 audit rating, locked liquidity, and confirmed exchange listings bring institutional-style credibility to a meme-coin structure.\nWith more than 3,100 holders already and 100+ new investors joining daily, AlphaPepe is showing early momentum in both community growth and investor interest. For traders positioning ahead of the next bull cycle, AlphaPepe's blend of low entry cost, clear upside, and structural transparency makes it a standout.\nSolana offers a strong, established platform with use-cases in DeFi, NFTs, and institutional adoption. Its move toward $300 would be meaningful, yet the percentage gain projected from current levels (given its large market cap) may be modest compared with earlier analogous crypto rallies.\nIn contrast, AlphaPepe sits at the pre-listing stage, where early entry could translate into multiples of upside if the project executes and market interest grows. While risk is inherently higher at this stage, the potential reward is also significantly greater.\nFor investors seeking steady growth and platform adoption, Solana remains a credible pick. For those targeting aggressive upside in the next cycle, AlphaPepe offers a more asymmetric opportunity.\nSolana remains one of the most respected Layer-1 platforms in crypto, with a realistic path toward $300 by 2026 if network growth, adoption, and institutional flows align. However, for investors looking for early-stage upside and structural mechanics built into the investment model, AlphaPepe is quickly becoming the best crypto to buy now.\nAt ~$0.00722, with staking live, instant delivery, strong audit crede"

It is not merely a technical level but also it is a confidence signal to both retail and institutional participants.\nSince Solana has a 50-day moving average which is approaching the 200-day moving average, analysts are expecting a golden cross \u2013 which is a classic strong bullish indicator.

                "source": "CoinDesk",
                "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/11/01/the-aws-outage-shows-why-crypto-can-t-keep-relying-on-centralized-infrastructure",
                "body": "The AWS Outage Shows Why Crypto Can't Keep Relying On Centralized Infrastructure\nFor an industry that prides itself on decentralization and constantly lauds its benefits, crypto exchanges being so reliant on vulnerable centralized cloud platforms for their own infrastructure feels like hypocrisy, argues Dr. Max Li, founder and CEO of OORT.\nYet again, the digital economy was caught off guard when Amazon Web Services suffered its second major outage this year on Oct. 20, crippling exchange platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood and the analytics service Coinmarketcap. It was followed by a second, smaller outage just 10 days later.\nAccording to Amazon\u2019s initial report, the Oct. 20 outage was caused by a malfunction affecting one of its internal subsystems that manages its domain name service, leading to connectivity issues in multiple services. It resulted from a faulty update, and it ended up taking out Amazon\u2019s critical U.S.-East-1 region. This is a massive hub of servers that powers many of the country\u2019s top internet services. For two hours, numerous trading platforms, streaming services, payment providers and gaming networks were inaccessible to users globally.\nNo doubt, Amazon\u2019s engineers were working overtime to try and fix the outage, and to the company\u2019s credit the vast majority of services that reported problems were back online within a couple of hours. But the incident once again highlights the hazards of relying on centralized infrastructure, coming just months after a similar outage in Amazon\u2019s eu-north-1 region. Going offline causes pain in just about every business, but for the crypto industry, where billions of dollars in value are traded by the hour, such events are unacceptable.\nIncalculable Losses For Traders\nAlthough it\u2019s quite rare for centralized cloud platforms like Amazon to go down, it does happen from time to time. And when it does, the impact is very often monumental, affecting millions if not billions of people globally. A case in point, just six months earlier, Amazon suffered a similar disruption, taking out two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto platforms \u2014 Binance and Kucoin \u2014 for several hours. Amazon isn\u2019t alone in this either, for rival clouds like Google and Microsoft Azure have suffered crippling outages of their own. In fact, Azure was down for several hours on Oct. 29, with reports suggesting it took offline numerous websites and online services.\nThe problem with centralized infrastructure is that it\u2019s, well, centralized. The weakness of these platforms is that they introduce single points of failure, due to the way they rely on critical components that, if taken offline, cause the entire system to come crashing down. It might be as simple as something like a computer server or a database that contains vital configuration settings, or a lone network connection that lacks redundancy. These vulnerabilities exist in every cloud, and no matter how diligent operators are they\u2019ll always present a risk.\nCoinbase was among the first services to report problems in the wake of Amazon\u2019s mishap, and it stepped up quickly to reassure its users that their funds are safe and secure. But this clarity doesn\u2019t fix the underlying issues of frozen transactions and delayed market orders \u2014hat occur when systems go offline without any warning. The longer the delay, the more the price of an asset might move, meaning the trader cannot capitalize on this. They may even lose money if the price of an asset dips shortly after they entered a position, and they\u2019re unable to sell.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to calculate the exact impact, it\u2019s likely that the paralysis inflicted on traders caused them pain and financial losses.\nIt\u2019s Time To Decentralize\nOne possible way to prevent this is for crypto exchanges to at least partially switch to a more resilient, decentralized infrastructure that eliminates these single points of failure. By operating some key modules of the trading system on a distributed network of servers, exchanges wil"

                "body": "L.A.\u2019s best sushi restaurant relocates with a star bartender and a new menu format\n- Share via\nThe Elysian is a mod apartment building originally designed in the 1960s by architect William Pereira. The original LACMA campus also numbered among Pereira\u2019s projects, as did my favorite skyscraper on the planet, the TransAmerica Building in San Francisco. This one sits on a hill, overlooking Sunset Boulevard, in Victor Heights, the small neighborhood abutting Elysian Park and bordering Echo Park and Chinatown.\nI timed my drive to a lull in traffic after the start of a Dodgers game this week to visit the Elysian\u2019s new ground-floor tenant, Morihiro, and a couple major shifts the relocation brings: a walk-in cocktail bar and an a la carte component to the menu.\nA new era for L.A.\u2019s best sushi restaurant\nTo sushi wonks, Morihiro \u201cMori\u201d Onodera needs no introduction. He arrived in Los Angeles 40 years ago this year, after training in sushi bars for a couple of years in Tokyo. Working at seminal L.A. sushi ground-breakers like Matsuhisa and Katsu, and running Mori Sushi in West Los Angeles for 11 years beginning in 2000, he\u2019s been a guiding hand in defining how Angelenos perceive and enjoy omakase.\nAfter a break from restaurant ownership, he returned with tiny Morihiro in Atwater Village in November 2020. Columnist Jenn Harris and I ranked it No. 6 on the current edition of the 101 Best Restaurants in Los Angeles guide.\nOnodera has never been afraid of change. Which may be why neither Harris nor I were overly surprised at first when we heard the news sitting together at Onodera\u2019s Atwater omakase counter at the end of August (yes, researching our next edition of the 101 guide, arriving in early December). His hands forming nigiri in a finger ballet, he slipped into casual conversation that he was moving the restaurant. Our eyebrows shot up. Then he smiled mysteriously.\n\u201cWe will have a bar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bringing on Han Suk Cho.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, you stole Han from Kato?!\u201d I shouted reflexively. His staff burst out laughing.\nMorihiro\u2019s star bartender\nOf course, Onodera didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d Cho. But it hit me as a shake-up. I\u2019ve written about how Cho and Kato\u2019s bar director Austin Hennelly are the city\u2019s most dynamic cocktail duo. Their spirit-forward versions of a Bee\u2019s Knees or milk punch flowed into the Taiwanese flavors of Jon Yao\u2019s cuisine, and the textures and sharpness of the non-alcoholic drinks they fine-tuned are, it isn\u2019t hyperbole to say, some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge examples of the genre.\nThe Elysian era settles Morihiro into a sleek room with neutral-colored walls, spare decor and an outdoor space with a lovely stone garden that\u2019s still a work in progress. Cho is the first person I see, standing at the near end of a long curving black bar. Onodera stands farther down, in the room\u2019s center, forming nigiri for three people dining omakase.\n\u201cI worked at Kato for 3 \u00bd years, a long time in one restaurant,\u201d Cho says to me later in a phone interview. \u201cI learned so much about the craft there, and Austin has been a very good shield for me. I could always bounce ideas off of him. But I had to go to really see how much I\u2019ve grown.\u201d\nBefore Kato, Cho focused on NA beverage pairing programs at top-tier restaurants. Last decade she worked briefly at Providence, and then at SingleThread in Sonoma, the luxury restaurant-inn-farm run by chef Kyle Connaughton and farmer Katina Connaughton that merges culinary notions of Japan and California, and then back down the coast at Dave Beran\u2019s now-closed Dialogue in Santa Monica.\nIn her position as bar director at Morihiro, she\u2019s starting out by concentrating on simplicity \u2014 less on distilling the season\u2019s jeweled fruits into complex liquid equations and more on figuring out the exact right mixture of three or four elements, in the best proportions, for a distinctive drink.\n\u201cMori\u2019s Martini,\u201d for instance, combines a California-Japanese mashup of St. George Botanivore, gin made in the Bay Area, with Bermutto"

                "body": "Nomura believes that the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are at an impasse in addressing the yen's weakness. The government expects the central bank to take action, while the central bank is waiting for clearer signals from the government regarding foreign exchange policy. This uncertainty represents a major risk in the current market and could lead to a sudden policy reversal, reminiscent of last year\u2019s 'yen carry trade.'\nAs the yen continues to weaken, the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have found themselves at an impasse over policy, prompting the market to recall the heart-stopping carry trades and their eventual collapse last spring.\nAccording to Zuitu Trading Desk, a report from Nomura dated October 31 indicates that the Japanese government and the BOJ are currently engaged in a \"game of chicken\" over the yen's depreciation. The report suggests that under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s leadership, the government is essentially standing by, expecting the BOJ to take action considering the impact of a weak yen on inflation.\nHowever, the BOJ appears to be waiting for clearer signals from the government. The report notes that foreign exchange policy falls under the jurisdiction of the government and the Ministry of Finance, and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has also stated that the government holds ultimate responsibility for monetary policy.\nThe Japanese government and the BOJ are evidently at odds in addressing the yen's depreciation. Fundamentally, the government is standing on the sidelines, hoping that the central bank will act in consideration of the impact of a weak yen on stabilizing inflation, while the BOJ is waiting for the government to provide clearer guidance on the weak yen issue.\nAgainst this backdrop, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not provide a clear hint of a December rate hike after the recent meeting, causing market expectations for a December rate increase to drop from 50-60% before the meeting to 46%. This policy hesitation and lag have created room for speculators.\nHistory Repeats Itself? Beware the Sharp Reversal of Last Year\u2019s 'Carry Trade'\nThe current policy deadlock reminds investors of last spring\u2019s market dynamics.\nAt that time, the 'combination carry trade'\u2014shorting the yen, going long on Japanese stocks, and receiving short-term yen swap rates\u2014was prevalent, once pushing the USD/JPY exchange rate above 160. However, following the BOJ\u2019s unexpected rate hike in July 2024, these trades rapidly reversed, causing USD/JPY to plummet to the 140 level.\nNomura's report warns that history may repeat itself. The report emphasizes that if the Japanese government and central bank again act too slowly, allowing speculative carry trades to expand once more, their eventual intervention could trigger a sharp decline in both the yen exchange rate and Japanese stock prices. The report states:\n\"If the government and central bank only intervene to curb yen weakness after speculators have expanded their yen and Nikkei carry trades, the USD/JPY exchange rate and stock prices could plummet simultaneously, as seen during the July 2024 meeting. Crucially, the government must take action before this point.\"\nSpeculators Still Have Ammunition; External Pressure May Increase\nDoes the market have the conditions to repeat last year's trends? Data provided in Nomura\u2019s report suggests that the answer is yes.\nIn the week ending October 20, despite a rise of over 3% in Japanese stocks, foreign investors' buying activity remained \"moderate.\" Their cumulative net purchases were only 58% of last summer's peak levels, indicating they still have \u201cuntapped purchasing power.\u201d\nThe report's authors believe that if the Japanese government continues with a \"non-interventionist\" stance (i.e., tacitly allowing yen depreciation), it may invite external pressure.
