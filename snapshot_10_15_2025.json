                "body": "This Gold Rush Is Ominous\nThe king of precious metals is having a good run right now. That might be a problem.\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\nWhen prices are high and global conflicts destabilize the world, some investors start looking backwards\u2014away from an uncertain future and toward the predictability of the past. And what\u2019s older and more dependable than gold?\nLast week, amid widespread geopolitical turmoil and a weakening U.S. dollar, the price of gold hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce. This year has so far been gold\u2019s best since 1979, a moment of instability so profound that it led to recession. Gold prices are much closer to a genuine \u201crecession indicator\u201d than, say, the resurgence of frozen yogurt or an uptick in Uber Eats orders. That\u2019s because, over the past 50 years, spikes in the price of gold have typically been correlated with widespread inflation and geopolitical dysfunction. In 1979, amid double-digit inflation numbers in the United States and a global energy crisis, investors stocked up on the precious metal as a way to counter those shocks. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as investors lost trust in major institutions once seen as \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d gold prices shot up again. And when persistent inflation was crushing the U.S. dollar after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, gold once again soared.\nThe precious metal has long been considered a safe-haven asset, because, unlike the U.S. dollar, its inherent value isn\u2019t determined by any state government. Although it\u2019s probably not realistic for everyone to start piling into Diamond District jewelry shops and hoarding gold bars, gold remains an appealing, if old-fashioned, alternative to more contemporary investments: Its value stems from its shine and rarity, not its ability to produce a line of credit.\nSome investors see gold as a standard way to diversify their portfolio. Others, stereotypically known as goldbugs, tend to be broadly skeptical about contemporary monetary policy. Just as investors in bitcoin, so-called digital gold, have historically skewed libertarian and anti-institutional, the most extreme goldbugs are betting against the system, doubtful that the Federal Reserve is capable of keeping the U.S. dollar strong. There\u2019s also only so much of the metal lodged in the planet\u2019s crust, compared with the dollar, which can be printed ad infinitum. At least until someone like Elon Musk figures out how to increase its supply by mining asteroids, gold will likely remain the doomer\u2019s hedge of choice. Whereas a different sort of investor looks to get in early on promising new technological innovations, the goldbug doesn\u2019t lose sight of what\u2019s tried-and-true.\nGold prices have already risen more than 50 percent this year and are showing no signs of stopping. The story of today\u2019s gold boom began in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided to sanction the Russian central bank by freezing its foreign-exchange reserves. The scale of these sanctions was a reminder of why countries might want to own assets that can\u2019t be easily frozen. Especially in emerging markets, central banks around the world \u201crealized that the truly only safe asset\u201d is gold, Daan Struyven, a co-head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told me.\nThe whiplash of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff spree this spring introduced new uncertainties for the global market. No nation or territory was off-limits (including remote islands inhabited only by penguins and seals). Trump\u2019s scattershot approach has had clear consequences, especially for countries with fledgling markets. Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are among the many nations now buying gold by the ton, according to World Bank data\u2014ostensibly to insulate themselves from any future shocks caused by U.S. policy. Meanwhile, S"

                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-14-gold-defies-expectations-a-historic-surge-not-a-tumble-reshapes-global-markets",
                "body": "In a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom and initial market assumptions, gold prices have not experienced a historic tumble, but rather a historic surge, reaching unprecedented record highs as of October 14, 2025. The precious metal has defied expectations of a decline driven by a hawkish Federal Reserve and a resurgent U.S. dollar. Instead, a dovish shift in the Fed's monetary policy, coupled with a weakening dollar and escalating global uncertainties, has propelled gold into an unparalleled rally, profoundly impacting global investors and markets from Asia to Europe.\nThis unexpected ascent of gold signals a significant re-evaluation of safe-haven assets and investor sentiment, highlighting a pervasive flight to safety amidst a complex global economic and geopolitical landscape. The implications are far-reaching, challenging traditional investment strategies and forcing a recalibration of portfolios worldwide.\nThe Golden Ascent: Detailing an Unprecedented Rally\nThe year 2025 has marked a watershed moment for gold, with the yellow metal embarking on an extraordinary and sustained rally that has seen its price soar to all-time highs. On October 14, 2025, spot gold touched an astonishing peak of $4,179.48 per ounce, representing a remarkable 57% gain year-to-date. This monumental achievement saw gold breach the $4,000 per ounce threshold for the first time in history in early October, cementing its status as a premier safe-haven asset.\nThe primary catalysts behind this historic surge are a decisively dovish Federal Reserve and a weakening U.S. dollar, a direct contradiction to the initially anticipated hawkish stance and dollar resurgence. The Federal Reserve, grappling with rising job market pressures and persistent inflation, has adopted an increasingly accommodative monetary policy. Following an interest rate cut in September 2025, market participants are now pricing in a near-certainty (97-99% probability) of another 25-basis-point reduction in October, with strong indications of further cuts before year-end. This aggressive easing strategy has significantly diminished the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, making it a more attractive investment compared to lower-yielding bonds.\nConcurrently, the U.S. dollar has experienced a multi-month decline in strength, further bolstering gold's appeal. As gold is primarily priced in U.S. dollars, a weaker dollar makes the metal more affordable and appealing to international buyers holding other currencies, thereby stimulating global demand. This inverse relationship has been a crucial tailwind for gold's rally. Adding to this, central banks globally are actively diversifying their reserves away from the U.S. dollar, with gold's share of global foreign exchange reserves reaching a record 24%, providing robust institutional support for its price. Beyond monetary policy, escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly renewed U.S.-China trade conflicts and ongoing global strife, coupled with persistent inflation concerns and burgeoning global debt, have collectively fueled market anxiety, driving investors en masse to the perceived safety of gold.\nBeneficiaries and Shifting Fortunes in a Golden Era\nThe historic surge in gold prices has created a clear divide between winners and losers in the financial markets, with gold-centric companies and investors in precious metals reaping substantial rewards.\nGold mining companies are undoubtedly among the primary beneficiaries. Firms like Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD), Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), and AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU) are reporting record profits and robust cash flows, buoyed by the significantly higher selling price of their primary commodity. This windfall allows them to potentially increase exploration budgets, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Similarly, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track gold prices, such as SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE"

                "body": "OPEC\u2019s latest Monthly Oil Market Report offered a steady and confident tone, keeping its global demand growth forecasts unchanged for both 2025 and 2026. The cartel continues to expect demand to rise by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and 1.4 million bpd next year, supported by firm economic activity across major economies. It also maintained its global growth outlook at 3% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, citing stronger data from the United States, China, India and Japan.\nDespite recent price softness, the organization emphasized that oil market fundamentals remain robust. September\u2019s average output rose by 630,000 bpd to 43.05 million bpd, driven largely by Saudi Arabia and Russia as OPEC+ continues to unwind the earlier cuts. Non-OPEC production is also expected to grow by 800,000 bpd in 2025 and 600,000 bpd in 2026, with Brazil, Canada, and the United States leading the gains.\nAt this time, investors interested in the sector could benefit from focusing on resilient stocks like APA Corporation APA, Civitas Resources CIVI and Devon Energy DVN.\nSteady Demand Outlook and Tighter Balances\nOPEC projects global oil demand to average 105.1 million bpd in 2025 and 106.5 million bpd in 2026, reaffirming its confidence in transport and industrial fuels. Gasoline and jet fuel are expected to lead growth with year-over-year increases of 430,000 bpd and 360,000 bpd, respectively, while petrochemical feedstock and diesel contribute nearly 600,000 bpd combined. The group anticipates only a modest 50,000 bpd deficit by 2026 if current production levels hold \u2014 a sharp revision from last month\u2019s forecast of a 700,000 bpd shortfall.\nHowever, OPEC believes global energy transition efforts will advance more slowly than many forecasters anticipate. Steady industrial expansion, recovering air travel, and growing energy needs in emerging markets \u2014 particularly across Asia \u2014 are expected to sustain consumption growth through the medium term.\nInvestment Implications\nFor investors, OPEC\u2019s steady projections suggest a cautiously constructive setup for the energy sector. These Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies with strong fundamentals and disciplined production strategies \u2014 such as APA Corporation, Civitas Resources and Devon Energy \u2014 remain well-positioned to benefit from tightening balances and resilient demand.\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAPA Corporation: Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based APA Corporation is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. APA\u2019s Suriname portfolio in South America is particularly exciting, where it continues to achieve significant drilling success. In the United States, the upstream player mainly operates in the prolific Permian Basin.\nCivitas Resources: Based in Denver, Civitas Resources focuses on the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Permian Basin across Texas and New Mexico. With strong well returns and a valuable midstream component, Civitas is positioned for growth. The company has become a leading consolidator in the DJ Basin and offers substantial returns to its shareholders, with a balanced production mix of oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nDevon Energy: Devon Energy is an independent energy company whose oil and gas operations are mainly concentrated in the onshore areas of North America, primarily in the United States. The company\u2019s assets are spread across the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin and Powder River Basin. The assets DVN owns have significant long-term growth potential. The company continues to expand its holdings through strategic acquisitions."

TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 and Vitol\u2019s Russel Hardy warn that prices this low could cut U.S. shale output by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels per day next year, tightening supply just as demand steadies.\nBackwardation Fades: Crude Market Signals Trouble Ahead for 2026\n- The spectre of a looming contango is haunting crude oil markets, especially now that the entire WTI futures contract curve for 2026 trades below $60 per barrel, i.e. below breakeven levels for most new shale wells.\n- Backwardation, the hallmark of sanctions-impacted 2023 and 2024, now only extends until February 2026, with a mere 70 cents separating the November and February futures contracts.\n- Whilst ICE Brent futures show the same narrowing backwardation trend, there\u2019s still almost $1 per barrel of a difference between Dated and ICE Brent, suggesting pockets of physical strength for November-loading cargoes.\n- Positioning of hedge fund money managers reflects the doom and gloom with the net length held in WTI futures and options currently at 29,410 contracts, 15% of what it was at the beginning of this year.\nMarket Movers\n- US LNG developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) reached an arbitration settlement with China\u2019s state-controlled Unipec over its failure to deliver cargoes under a 3-year fixed-price contract, avoiding an arbitration litigation akin to BP.\n- Canadian oil producer Strathcona Resources formally abandoned its hostile takeover bid for peer producer MEG Energy (TSO:MEG), paving the way for a prospective MEG-Cenovus merger despite it owning 14.2% of the former.\n- US oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is close to signing an exploration deal with the Greek government to develop four deepwater blocks south of the island of Crete, with surveying set to start in 2026 already.\n- UK-based energy major Shell (LON:SHEL) has greenlighted the development of the HI offshore gas field in Nigeria for an estimated cost of $2 billion, alongside joint venture partner Sunlink Energies.\nTuesday, October 14, 2025\nResurgent US-China trade tensions have dealt a painful blow to oil sentiment at large, as President Trump\u2019s reimposition of 100% import tariffs from November 1 (over and above the 30% currently in place) bodes ill for the global economy in 2026. With backwardation at its shallowest since January 2024, ICE Brent at $62 per barrel feels more of a temporary level before the next big slide.\nOPEC Downplays 2026 Supply Surplus. OPEC kept its demand forecast for 2025 and 2026, questioning the danger of a supply surplus next year, saying that if OPEC+ kept production at its September 2025 levels, balances would remain at a deficit.\nSaudi Arabia Spends Big on Algeria. Algeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm Sonatrach reported that it had signed a $5.4 billion contract with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Midad Energy to develop oil and gas fields in the Illizi Basin, with a production-sharing contract signed for 30 years.\nIraq Flaunts Idea of OPEC+ Quota Review. Iraq\u2019s prime minister Mohammed al-Sudani has called for a formal review of the country\u2019s 4.43 million b/d OPEC+ production quota, citing reconstruction needs and rapid population growth as Kurdish exports restarted.\nKuwait Boosts Its Offshore Tally.

The group anticipates only a modest 50,000 bpd deficit by 2026 if current production levels hold \u2014 a sharp revision from last month\u2019s forecast of a 700,000 bpd shortfall.\nHowever, OPEC believes global energy transition efforts will advance more slowly than many forecasters anticipate. Steady industrial expansion, recovering air travel, and growing energy needs in emerging markets \u2014 particularly across Asia \u2014 are expected to sustain consumption growth through the medium term.\nInvestment Implications\nFor investors, OPEC\u2019s steady projections suggest a cautiously constructive setup for the energy sector. These Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies with strong fundamentals and disciplined production strategies \u2014 such as APA Corporation, Civitas Resources and Devon Energy \u2014 remain well-positioned to benefit from tightening balances and resilient demand.\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAPA Corporation: Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based APA Corporation is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. APA\u2019s Suriname portfolio in South America is particularly exciting, where it continues to achieve significant drilling success. In the United States, the upstream player mainly operates in the prolific Permian Basin.\nCivitas Resources: Based in Denver, Civitas Resources focuses on the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Permian Basin across Texas and New Mexico. With strong well returns and a valuable midstream component, Civitas is positioned for growth. The company has become a leading consolidator in the DJ Basin and offers substantial returns to its shareholders, with a balanced production mix of oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nDevon Energy: Devon Energy is an independent energy company whose oil and gas operations are mainly concentrated in the onshore areas of North America, primarily in the United States. The company\u2019s assets are spread across the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin and Powder River Basin. The assets DVN owns have significant long-term growth potential. The company continues to expand its holdings through strategic acquisitions."

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair saw a modest rise after incurring nearly 0.5% losses the previous day, trading at approximately 1.1570 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. The pair maintained its position in anticipation of Germany\u2019s ZEW Survey data and the final September Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).\nPolitical tensions in France exerted pressure on the euro, as President Macron reappointed a new Prime Minister despite facing a no-confidence motion from opposition leaders. Simultaneously, the US Dollar remained restrained with a 97% chance of rate cut expectations for October and a 92% chance for December, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool.\nImpact Of US Trade Tariffs\nPhiladelphia Fed President commented on trade tariffs and their likelihood of impacting inflation, arguing for further rate cuts by the US central bank. The USD also suffered from caution surrounding the ongoing US government shutdown, affecting the broader economy.\nThe Euro is the currency for 19 European Union countries, accounting for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions. Economic indicators like GDP and the trade balance significantly influence the Euro\u2019s value, benefiting from high rates and positive trade balances. Data from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain is influential, representing 75% of the Eurozone\u2019s economy.\nGiven the current stalemate in EUR/USD around 1.1570, we see the market being pulled by two opposing forces. On one hand, the US dollar is weakening due to an ongoing government shutdown and a highly dovish Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the Euro is being held back by significant political uncertainty in France.\nThe pressure on the dollar is intense, with markets pricing in a 97% probability of an interest rate cut this month. We can look back at the 35-day US government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, which trimmed an estimated $11 billion from GDP, to understand the economic drag traders are now pricing in. This makes shorting the dollar a compelling, though crowded, trade.\nFrench Political Impact On Euro\nFor the Euro, the no-confidence motion against the new French government is a major binary event that could cause a sudden spike in volatility. We remember the market jitters during the French presidential election in 2017, which shows how sensitive the Euro is to political risk in its core countries. This situation makes buying options straddles, which profit from a large move in either direction, an attractive strategy to capture the potential breakout.\nWith the pair currently treading water, implied volatility is likely low, making options relatively inexpensive. The Euro Currency Volatility Index (EVZ) has been hovering near a historically low 6.5, suggesting complacency in the market. Traders should consider buying volatility now, ahead of the French political outcome and the Fed\u2019s decision.\nThe upcoming German ZEW Economic Sentiment survey will be the market\u2019s immediate focus. A poor reading from Germany, the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy, could be the catalyst that breaks the 1.1550 support level, especially when combined with the French political drama. We would then expect traders to aggressively purchase put options to hedge or speculate on further downside."

A frail market sentiment, amid ongoing concerns about global trade, is keeping investors' appetite for risk subdued.\nNews that China and the United States have raised their fees on each other's vessels has reactivated concerns about a trade war between the world's two major economies on Tuesday. This has dampened previous hopes of a de-escalation, following US Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent's announcement on Monday of an upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\nData from Germany revealed that consumer inflation accelerated to 2.4% in September from 2.2% in August, in line with the preliminary reading. The Euro (EUR) edges lower following the data release.\nThe US economic docket remains thin, amid a data blackout from the US federal government. Still, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell will speak later today. However, in the absence of hard data to contextualize his comments, he is unlikely to alter market expectations of two interest rate cuts by the central bank in the next two meetings.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the Australian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: The US Dollar appreciates amid trade war fears\nMarket hopes that US President Trump's softer tone towards China would lead to a new de-escalation of the trade rift have been crushed by news that China has started charging higher fees to US cargo vessels, in a move that will be responded to in the US, opening a new front in trade hostilities.\nApart from that, Chinese authorities have dampened tensions between the two countries, as Beijing accused the US of having \"double standards\" and the commerce ministry affirmed that the US cannot seek dialogue, while threatening new measures.\nAll this stems from China's decision to impose restrictions on rare earth exports to Western countries announced last week, which was responded to by Trump with a threat of 100% levies on Chinese imports effective on November 1, which rattled financial markets and sent the US Dollar tumbling last Friday.\nOn the macroeconomic front, German Consumer Prices Index (CPI) data showed a 0.2% increase in September and a 2.4% year-on-year growth, accelerating from 0.1% and 2.2%, respectively, in August. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has revealed the same figures.\nLater on the day, the German ZEW Economic Sentiment Index is expected to show a moderate improvement, yet with the gauge measuring the current economic situation steady at historically low levels.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD is under bearish pressure below 1.1600\nEUR/USD remains on its back foot after failing to regain the 1.1600 level on Monday. Technical indicators in the 4-hour chart highlight the bearish momentum, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) capped below the 50 level and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) about to cross below the signal line.\nSupport at the 1.1560 area (intraday low) is holding bears for now, but it remains under pressure as upside attempts keep finding sellers.

                "body": "EUR/USD Declines Toward 1.1550 as Trade Tensions, Stronger Dollar, and Powell\u2019s Outlook Drive Pressure\nThe euro continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD sliding toward 1.1550, marking its lowest level in over two months. Renewed U.S.\u2013China tariff tensions, a firm U.S. dollar, and investor caution ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech are weighing heavily on sentiment. Market participants positioned defensively after President Trump\u2019s 100% tariff threat on Chinese imports, set to take effect in November, while Beijing retaliated with new export restrictions and port fees.\nThe result has been a surge in safe-haven demand for the dollar, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) steadying around 99.25, maintaining strength even as Treasury yields edged lower. The euro, meanwhile, found limited support from European fundamentals, with Germany\u2019s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index undershooting expectations and reinforcing concerns over slowing regional growth.\nMonetary Policy Divergence Adds to Euro Weakness\nMarkets remain fixated on how the Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy steps will shape global FX dynamics. Traders have priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut in October and another in December, which would bring the federal funds rate to 3.75%\u20134.00%, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. However, despite these anticipated cuts, the dollar continues to attract capital flows amid a persistent U.S. fiscal stalemate, risk aversion, and stronger economic resilience compared to the eurozone.\nIn contrast, ECB policymakers remain constrained by fragile inflation and tepid output, leaving the central bank with little room to maneuver. The euro\u2019s inability to gain traction highlights investor skepticism over Europe\u2019s recovery narrative, particularly with Germany struggling to avoid recessionary signals.\nTechnical Outlook: Key Resistance at 1.1630, Support at 1.1470\nTechnically, EUR/USD continues to trade within a descending channel, confirming a medium-term bearish structure. The pair is capped by the 50-day EMA at 1.1636 and 200-day EMA near 1.1686, while downside pressure remains dominant below both averages. The immediate floor lies near 1.1540, followed by a deeper support zone around 1.1470\u2014a level that, if breached, could open the path toward 1.1380.\nMomentum indicators remain weak, with the RSI hovering near 41, suggesting subdued buying interest. On the upside, bulls face a critical hurdle at 1.1630, the upper boundary of the channel. A confirmed close above that region would indicate a short-term reversal, but prevailing market sentiment still favors sellers.\nMacroeconomic Drivers: U.S. Shutdown and Inflation Data in Focus\nThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown, now entering its third week, adds complexity to the macro landscape. While the standoff threatens to dampen near-term growth, it also reinforces the dollar\u2019s safe-haven appeal. Attention now turns to the upcoming U.S. CPI release on October 15, expected to show a 0.4% month-on-month rise and an annual inflation rate near 3.1%, up from 1.9%. A weaker print could reignite dovish bets on the Fed, but a stronger reading would likely fuel another leg of dollar gains.\nIn Europe, inflation remains well below target, and economic data from France, Germany, and Italy continue to disappoint. Weak industrial output and sluggish consumer sentiment deepen the contrast between the eurozone and U.S. economic performance, sustaining the dollar\u2019s dominance in the near term.\nMarket Sentiment: Cautious Ahead of Powell\u2019s Remarks\nTraders remain wary ahead of Powell\u2019s comments, expected to clarify whether the Fed intends to accelerate rate cuts or hold steady amid mounting political pressure. Any indication of further easing could briefly lift EUR/USD, though the underlying trend remains bearish. The U.S.\u2013China tariff conflict, meanwhile, continues to shape broader market psychology.

Meanwhile, the British pound held above its 200-day EMA despite weaker UK employment and wage data that fuelled expectations of a Bank of England (BoE) cut later this year.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nView related analysis:\n- US Dollar Rebound Appears Corrective, EUR/USD And GBPUSD Set To Bounce?\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY\n- AUD/USD, USD/JPY: Mild Rebound for Australian Dollar and Yen Faces Resistance\n- Japanese Yen Selloff Losing Steam, AUD/JPY and AUD/USD Bears Resurface\nUS Dollar and Yields Decline After Powell\u2019s Dovish Remarks\nThe US government shutdown has halted the flow of vital economic data used by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to guide its monetary policy. That also means traders lack the usual tools to anticipate the Fed\u2019s next move. This uncertainty has helped bolster the US dollar on the assumption that no data means no action from the Fed \u2014 at least at its upcoming meeting. That was until Fed Chair Jerome Powell seemingly confirmed that an October rate cut is still on track and that the end of quantitative tightening (QT) could be nearing, during his speech to the National Association for Business Economics on Tuesday.\nWhile Powell said data before the shutdown suggested that growth may be stronger than expected, he noted that \u201cdownside risks to the US jobs market have risen\u201d. He admitted that the government data they lack is the \u201cgold standard\u201d, but added that the Fed has access to private data sources as an alternative. With Powell now signalling that QT may be nearing its end, the case for further rate cuts next year appears to be strengthening.\nUS yields were lower, with the 2-year yield falling to its lowest level since September 2022 at 3.48%. The 10-year yield sits just above 4% \u2014 a one-month low \u2014 and the 30-year yield is at a 17-month low of 4.6%. The US dollar index slipped slightly by -0.2%, and with it still trading below last week\u2019s high, bullish momentum appears to be waning.\nUS Dollar Index (DXY) Falters, Yields Decline\nLast week I reiterated my bias that the dollar\u2019s current rally is corrective and that bears may be best served waiting for evidence of a swing high at higher levels. Not only could the 100 handle prove a tough nut to crack, given its round-number significance, but it also sits just above the August high and two 100% projection levels from the July and September swing lows.\nThat said, I cannot rule out another leg higher, given prices are coiling within a potential bullish pennant on the daily chart. Still, with the prospects of QT ending and rate cuts remaining on the table, I suspect we may be nearer the end of this corrective bounce than the beginning. And let\u2019s not forget the TACO trade, which assumes the latest trade spat between the US and China could fizzle out ahead of the Trump\u2013Xi summit. I will therefore continue to seek evidence of a swing high on the dollar\u2019s daily chart to help identify potential swing lows elsewhere.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView U.S. Dollar Index Futures, LSEG\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs US Dollar\nThe weaker US dollar allowed the British pound to hold above its 200-day average on Tuesday, despite softer employment and wages figures reigniting bets that the Bank of England (BoE) could cut rates sooner rather than later. That said, traders may be hesitant to become too bearish on sterling ahead of the looming Autumn Budget. From a price action perspective, when a market like GBP/USD repeatedly fails to break support, it often becomes a candidate for a countertrend move higher, in my view.\nGBP/USD briefly dipped beneath its 200-day EMA on Tuesday to touch a two-and-a-half-month low.

Traders expect the BoE to cut interest rates further by 46 basis points (bps) this year, according to Reuters.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produc"

The US Dollar (USD) weakens against the Japanese Yen (JPY) amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China and a persistent risk-off environment. The Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak later on Wednesday, including Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Jeff Schmid.\nReuters reported on Tuesday that the US and China began charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil. Additionally, US President Donald Trump said that he could still impose 100% tariffs on China on November 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing\u2019s next move in the rare earths dispute.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank is on track to deliver another quarter-point interest-rate reduction later this month, even as a government shutdown significantly reduces its read on the economy. Powell highlighted the low pace of hiring and noted that it may weaken further. Expectations for a Fed rate cut in October were little changed after Powell\u2019s comments. Investors see a nearly 100% possibility of a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nOn the other hand, political uncertainty in Japan, particularly following the withdrawal of the Komeito party from the ruling coalition, could create a challenge for the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to hike interest rates further and continue to undermine the JPY. Last week, Etsuro Honda, a close economic adviser to Sanae Takaichi, said that the BoJ should be cautious about raising interest rates again, as the economy is still fragile.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "Synopsis\nGoldman Sachs has raised its USD/JPY forecasts following Sanae Takaichi\u2019s unexpected win in Japan\u2019s LDP leadership election, which triggered renewed yen weakness and a reassessment of fiscal and policy risks. The bank now sees a slower and smaller yen appreciation path, citing stronger global and domestic headwinds but still expects modest yen strength over the medium term as rate differentials compress.\nKey Points\n-\nTakaichi\u2019s win resets yen levels:\nThe yen weakened broadly after Takaichi\u2019s victory, aligning with Goldman\u2019s initial expectations but showing further underperformance in the days that followed. The result has reintroduced a mild fiscal risk premium tied to concerns over her long-term policy stance. -\nLimited fiscal and BoJ policy changes expected:\nGoldman\u2019s economists still expect only modest fiscal expansion and no changes to the BoJ\u2019s modal policy path. However, the bank notes that market perceptions of policy risks could shift based on cabinet appointments, coalition stability, and Takaichi\u2019s future remarks. -\nTwo-way risks ahead:\nGoldman sees heightened volatility in the coming weeks as investors gauge whether fiscal spending will increase further or remain contained under coalition constraints. -\nWeaker yen outlook in near term:\nThe bank now sees stronger headwinds for the yen from both fiscal stimulus expectations and a supportive global macro backdrop for the USD. This reduces the likely speed and magnitude of yen appreciation in the months ahead. -\nRevised USD/JPY forecasts:\nGoldman now projects USD/JPY at 150 (3M), 148 (6M), and 145 (12M)\u2014up from 142, 138, and 135 previously\u2014reflecting a weaker yen baseline but a gradual strengthening trend over time as hedging costs and front-end rate spreads narrow.\nConclusion\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 new forecasts reflect a measured recalibration of yen expectations after Takaichi\u2019s surprise win. While the near-term bias favors a weaker JPY amid fiscal and political uncertainty, the medium-term outlook still calls for modest yen gains as monetary policy differentials compress and global financial conditions ease."

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price remains weaker for the second successive session, trading around $58.20 at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices declined as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of an Oil supply surplus in 2026.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

Bond yields slipped on both sides of the border, with Canadian 10-year notes falling in line with US Treasuries after the Thanksgiving slowdown.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Big picture forces keep the loonie grounded.\nThe Canadian dollar is caught between weaker oil prices and shifting interest rate bets. With US crude down over 1% to $58.70 and the International Energy Agency forecasting a supply surplus in 2026, oil-linked currencies like Canada\u2019s are under pressure. Still, expectations for Fed rate cuts are acting as a cushion, meaning investors are increasingly looking to central bank signals and global economic momentum, rather than just local headlines.\nThe bigger picture: Changing rates and oil trends set the stage.\nCanada\u2019s financial landscape is being shaped by the interplay between global monetary policy and commodity trends. Uncertainty around the Fed\u2019s next steps is keeping the loonie and local bonds on their toes, leaving businesses and governments planning for a world where international policy shifts and oil prices move the needle for growth, investment, and trade.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nTheodora Lee Joseph, CFA \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 less than a minute ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Most Read: Gold (XAU/USD) Price Eyes Acceptance Above $4100/oz on US-China Trade War Fears, Up 2% on the Day\nThe loonie has recovered in the US session after starting the day on the back foot. The move was more driven by the US dollar than any developments on the side of the Canadian Dollar.\nThe loonie has come under pressure in recent days as oil prices have also retreated to fresh lows. When it comes to USD/CAD, the loonies weakness coincided with a rally for the US Dollar which has defied the US Government shutdown and US-China tensions to leave the US Dollar Index (DXY) hovering near recent highs.\nTechnical Analysis - USD/CAD\nBack to the technicals though and USD/CAD has broken the channel which had help price over for just over two months. This sets up USD/CAD for a potential 280 pip move.\nThe medium-term outlook does look positive for USD/CAD as price has broken above the psychological 1.4000 handle and the 200-day MA. This is the first time USD/CAD trades above the 200-day MA since April 10, 2025. Funny enough this also coincided with USD/CAD breaking below the 1.4000 handle as is the case with the break above this time around.\nThis makes the 200-day MA key for me and thus if we are to see the bullish move continue, price needs to remain above the 200-day MA if we get any pullback in price.\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart, October 14, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nDropping down to the four-hour chart and you can see that we have just had a bearish engulfing candle close.\nTogether with the daily hovering near overbought territory (it was in overbought territory when USD/CAD was at its daily high) could lead to a slightly deeper pullback.\nIf this does materialize, the swing low at 1.39840 is very close to the 200-day MA on the daily timeframe, which rests around\nThus a hold above this level may be the sign for those would be bulls looking to get involved.\nUSD/CAD Four-Hour Chart, October 14, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nEconomic Data Ahead\nThe US Government shutdown remains in effect and thus data from a US perspective remains out of reach. There is also a lack of high impact data from Canada this week with a speech by Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem the highlight.\nThis could leave the technicals as a major driver for price moves while trade war developments between the US and China will also play a role.\nNext week is much more interesting. We get the releases of key inflation data from the US & Canada.\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.\nClient Sentiment Data - USD/CAD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are short on USDCAD with 75% of traders net-short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are short means USD/CAD prices could rise in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair experiences a decline of around 100 pips from the daily peak as demand for the Japanese Yen (JPY) increases. This movement occurs despite potential delays in Bank of Japan rate hikes, which might limit further JPY gains. Market participants are now focused on upcoming UK employment data for new direction.\nImpact Of UK Jobs Data\nTrading around the 202.60 mark, GBP/JPY is down 0.20% for the day, influenced by a stronger JPY. Positive UK jobs data could reinforce expectations that the Bank of England will halt interest rate cuts, possibly supporting the British Pound. However, concerns over the UK fiscal outlook ahead of the Autumn budget in November might restrain GBP gains.\nDemand for the Japanese Yen remains robust, partly due to Japan\u2019s Finance Minister addressing FX market volatility. Speculation arises around potential government intervention to prevent further JPY weakness. Additionally, US-China trade tensions strengthen the JPY\u2019s safe-haven appeal, adding pressure on the currency pair.\nThe GBP/JPY cross may retain some support as domestic political issues might hinder the Bank of Japan\u2019s ability to raise interest rates. Market conditions currently prevent aggressive long positions on the JPY, limiting GBP/JPY losses. Traders are advised to await strong selling signals to confirm a near-term peak in the currency pair.\nGiven today is October 14, 2025, we see the pound hesitating against the yen ahead of crucial UK jobs data. A strong report today could reinforce the view that the Bank of England is done cutting rates, especially since we\u2019ve seen UK wage growth remain stubbornly above 5% for most of this year. This would typically push GBP/JPY higher, but the market seems cautious.\nFor traders expecting a significant move after the 6:00 AM jobs release, but unsure of the direction, buying a short-dated straddle could be effective. This options strategy would profit from a spike in volatility if the unemployment number deviates from the 4.7% consensus. A surprise to the upside might send the cross lower, while a strong number could finally push it towards the highs we saw in July 2024.\nPotential Yen Intervention\nOn the yen side, we must remain alert to the risk of intervention from Japanese authorities to strengthen their currency. We saw them act decisively back in 2022 when the currency weakened dramatically, and with the Finance Minister\u2019s recent warnings, they could step in again. This risk puts a potential cap on how high GBP/JPY can go in the coming weeks.\nTo manage this risk, we could consider buying some out-of-the-money GBP/JPY put options expiring in November. These act as a cheap form of insurance, paying off if there is a sudden and sharp drop caused by intervention or a broader risk-off mood. The recent US-China trade tensions over electric vehicle tariffs only add to the yen\u2019s appeal as a safe haven, making this a prudent hedge.\nLonger-term, the political chaos in Japan following the collapse of the LDP-Komeito coalition last week makes it harder for the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. This underlying political uncertainty should keep the yen fundamentally weak, providing a floor for GBP/JPY. The upcoming UK Autumn budget in November is the next major known risk event that could shift this balance."

This would help boost the pound and provide support for GBP/JPY.\nHowever, uncertainties surrounding the upcoming Autumn Fiscal Budget in November may restrain bullish positions from adding further exposure.\nEmily Clarke, a foreign exchange strategist at HSBC London, stated: 'If employment data exceeds expectations, GBP/JPY could see a short-term rebound towards 203.50, but fiscal risks may limit further upside.'\nJapanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato\u2019s warning on rapid fluctuations in the forex market sparked speculation of potential intervention, enhancing the yen\u2019s status as a relatively safe-haven asset. Meanwhile, renewed trade tensions between the US and Asian countries have increased safe-haven inflows into the yen.\nNevertheless, due to increasing domestic political uncertainty in Japan\u2014following the dissolution of the LDP\u2013Komeito coalition and new Prime Minister Masanori Takai needing support from other parties for her policies\u2014the market generally believes that the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) prospects for a near-term interest rate hike are limited, which restricts further appreciation of the yen.\nHiroshi Yamamoto, a strategist at Nomura Tokyo, noted: 'The yen is benefiting from safe-haven flows, but political uncertainty and delayed BoJ policy expectations make it difficult for the currency to appreciate rapidly.'\nFrom a daily chart perspective, GBP/JPY has retraced from the July 2024 high of 205.30 and is currently holding above the support zone around 202. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages remain in an upward alignment, and although the MACD momentum column has narrowed slightly, the overall bullish structure remains intact.\nThe RSI indicator stands at approximately 52, indicating room for short-term adjustments. If prices break below the initial support at 201.50, a short-term pullback could extend to 200.80 or even the psychological level of 200.00. Conversely, if GBP is boosted by employment data and breaks through the resistance at 203.50, it may retest the range of 204.50\u2013205.00.\nThe short-term pressure on GBP/JPY is primarily attributed to the safe-haven nature of the yen and market anticipation of the release of UK employment data. If the UK employment data is strong, short-term bullish sentiment may rebound; however, yen-related policy and political uncertainties still pose constraints on upward momentum.\nOverall, GBP/JPY remains within a medium-term upward channel, with key focus on fluctuations within the range of 201.50\u2013203.50."

                "body": "Why Bitcoin ETF trading volume exploded to $9.7B as trade war fears hit\nBitcoin ETFs saw their biggest action in months after US tariff threats jolted markets, yet barely any new inflows.\nBitcoin ETFs saw a surge in trading activity on Friday and Monday, with combined volumes reaching $9.7 billion and $6.7 billion as tariff headlines rattled risk markets.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT alone handled over $6.9 billion on Oct. 10 (its second-highest day ever), as investors repositioned around the day\u2019s price volatility.\nBitcoin ETF volume surge\nThis dramatic uptick in trading volume, far surpassing typical daily averages of $2-3 billion, signals a frenzy of buying and selling rather than straightforward accumulation.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have become a go-to vehicle for institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to BTC without direct custody hassles. But why the explosion now? The culprit lies in a perfect storm of macroeconomic shocks, specifically escalating tariff threats from US policymakers.\nOn Oct. 10, headlines about potential 60% tariffs on Chinese imports sent shockwaves through global risk assets, amplifying fears of trade wars and inflation spikes.\nBeing a hedge against fiat debasement and a high-beta risk asset, Bitcoin plunged nearly 18% intraday from $122,600 to $102,546, its sharpest drop in months.\nThis volatility created ripe opportunities (and necessities) for trading. Investors rushed to ETFs to execute rapid trades: long-term fund holders trimmed positions to lock in gains from BTC\u2019s summer rally above $125,000, while opportunistic traders piled in at the dip, betting on a rebound.\nShort-term speculators amplified the chaos, with leveraged plays on platforms like CME futures spilling over into ETF liquidity.\nThe result? Turnover skyrocketed as shares changed hands multiple times. Unlike calmer periods, where ETF volumes mirror steady inflows, this spike looks like pure adrenaline: traders using the low-fee, regulated structure of products like IBIT (0.25% expense ratio) as a frictionless on-ramp to BTC volatility.\nHowever, the spike in volume in the past two trading days is in stark contrast with ETF inflows. Farside data showed that on Oct. 10, net outflows were just -$5.7 million, while volumes hit $9.67 billion. Net activity remained subdued even on Oct. 13, with volumes at $6.67 billion.\nThis gap illustrates a key distinction: trading volume gauges gross activity (total shares traded), often inflated by back-and-forth churn during swings, whereas net inflows measure true capital addition after redemptions. In volatile times, the former surges as traders react, but the latter lags unless sentiment shifts durably bullish.\nThis pattern isn\u2019t new but has intensified post-ETF launch.\nIn March 2025\u2019s bull run, volumes and inflows synced at $15-20 billion days, fueled by pension funds allocating anew. Tariff fears, however, evoke 2022\u2019s macro rout, where BTC volumes spiked 5x without net gains.\nBy Monday, Oct. 13, as dust settled and BTC rebounded to $115,250 (up 2.3%), volumes eased, suggesting exhaustion. IBIT still dominated at $4.72 billion, but the frenzy waned as markets digested the news.\nOutflows jumped to $326.4 million on Oct.13 because the dust had settled, and caution took over. Bitcoin rebounded slightly to $115,250 (up 2.3% from the Oct. 10 close), letting some investors cash out gains.\nWeekend crypto liquidations topped $20 billion, fueling broader fear of trade wars and inflation. Institutions de-risked by pulling money out ahead of more headlines, even as trading volume dropped to $6.7 billion. In short, the initial chaos hid balanced flows; the calm after let sellers dominate.\nIn the coming weeks, persistent tariff rhetoric could sustain elevated volumes, pressuring the $111,000 Bitcoin price at press time. If trade tensions escalate, expect more \u201cflight to volatility\u201d trades, potentially pushing ETF turnover toward $10 billion routinely.\nYet, without corresponding inflows above $750 million daily, sust"

Meanwhile, US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs started the week with more than $750 million in outflows after Friday\u2019s crash, and Bhutan migrated its national ID system from Polygon to Ethereum.\nUS gov\u2019t could add $14B to crypto reserves as part of forfeiture case\nA US federal court has unsealed a criminal indictment involving a massive fraud scheme that could result in the government increasing its national Bitcoin reserves by $14 billion.\nIn a Tuesday notice from the US Justice Department, authorities said they had filed a forfeiture complaint against 127,271 Bitcoin (BTC), worth about $14.4 billion at the time of publication. The Bitcoin was tied to an indictment against Chen Zhi, founder and chair of a Cambodia-based company that was allegedly responsible for orchestrating \u201cpig butchering\u201d crypto investment schemes.\nThe US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Zhi\u2019s company, the Prince Holding Group, and its affiliates on the same day the indictment was unsealed.\nAccording to the complaint, the US will seek forfeiture upon Zhi\u2019s conviction in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, where he faces charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. The Justice Department said the Bitcoin was \u201cpresently in the custody of the US government\u201d amid the criminal case.\nIf approved by the court following Zhi\u2019s potential conviction, the Bitcoin forfeiture would represent one of the most significant additions of cryptocurrency to the US strategic reserve since its establishment. US President Donald Trump set up national Bitcoin and crypto reserves via executive order in March.\nUS spot Bitcoin, Ether ETFs shed $755 million after crypto market crash\nSpot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the United States saw combined outflows of more than $755 million on Monday following record crypto liquidations over the weekend.\nBitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded a net outflow of $326.52 million, according to SoSoValue data. Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw the largest outflow at $93.28 million, while Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a $145.39 million outflow.\nOther notable funds, including Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), also posted daily outflows of $21.12 million and $115.64 million, respectively. However, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw $60.36 million in inflows.\nAs of writing, total cumulative inflows remained at $62.44 billion, with total net assets across all spot BTC ETFs reaching $157.18 billion, or 6.81% of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap. Overall, the funds saw $2.71 billion in inflows last week.\nEther (ETH) ETFs registered $428.52 million in outflows on Monday. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) saw the largest daily outflow of $310.13 million, followed by Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) at $20.99 million, and Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund (FETH) at $19.12 million.\nBhutan migrates its national ID system to Ethereum\nThe South Asian nation of Bhutan is migrating its self-sovereign ID system to Ethereum from Polygon, allowing its nearly 800,000 residents to verify their identities and access government services.\nThe integration with Ethereum has been completed, while the migration of all resident credentials is expected to finish by the first quarter of 2026, according to Ethereum Foundation President Aya Miyaguchi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply inspiring to see a nation commit to empowering its citizens with self-sovereign identity,\u201d Miyaguchi posted to X on Monday, adding that the Ethereum integration was a world-first.\nIntegrating a blockchain-based solution into a government\u2019s national ID system has long been touted as a promising crypto use case, due to its immutability, transparency and privacy features, particularly when zero-knowledge proofs are implemented."

A decisive close above $200 could accelerate recovery toward $222 and $262 resistances, completing a bullish retest.\nHowever, a rejection from the channel boundary could invite renewed selling pressure. Despite this near-term volatility, Solana\u2019s strong DeFi fundamentals and institutional activity continue to provide a solid backdrop for recovery.\nEthereum price slides below $4K as bulls lose grip\nEthereum\u2019s price action paints a more cautious picture as it slipped below the $4,000 mark, signaling growing bearish pressure. The token now risks retesting the key $3,400\u2013$3,500 demand zone identified on the chart.\nThis region previously acted as a strong reversal point, but fading momentum suggests bulls are struggling to defend it.\nEthereum\u2019s inability to sustain higher lows within its prior ascending channel contrasts sharply with Solana\u2019s resilience.\nMoreover, traders remain cautious amid increased competition from faster networks and ongoing DeFi migration.\nAre investors rotating or retreating?\nCoinGlass data shows that on the 14th of October, Solana and Ethereum each saw over $162 million in outflows, $162.4 million and $162.3 million respectively, signaling broad investor caution across major altcoins.\nThe near-identical figures point to a wider market shift toward risk management, rather than a Solana-specific sell-off.\nNotably, Ethereum outflows are often linked to speculative unwinding, while Solana\u2019s tend to reflect staking activity and reinvestment within its ecosystem.\nThis contrast highlights a shift in investor behavior, suggesting that internal capital rotation could continue to support Solana\u2019s long-term position in DeFi.\nIn conclusion, Solana\u2019s strong DeFi presence, technical robustness, and rising institutional interest underscore its increasing challenge to Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\nAs Ethereum struggles to hold price stability amid selling pressure, Solana\u2019s active network and recovery potential suggest it may keep narrowing the gap in both market value and user adoption."

                "body": "Ethereum has recorded new levels of on-chain activity, with its L1 network increasing all-time highs in daily transactions and active addresses. Gas fees, on the other hand, have fallen to the lowest levels in years.\nAccording to Token Terminal data, Ethereum\u2019s daily transactions have surpassed 2 million, while active addresses have maintained above 1 million in recent weeks. These record activity levels coincided with low gas fees, averaging near $10\u201320 million per day, compared to the over $200 million daily highs recorded during the 2021 bull market.\nA surge in recent institutional investments and retail adoption has driven Ethereum\u2019s growth in network usage. The token surpassed 50 million transactions in August alone, representing its highest monthly figure.\nDuring the same period, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume also hit an all-time high, exceeding $130 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The network transaction value reached $320 billion, marking Ethereum\u2019s third-largest month in transactional activities.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has risen to about $86.04 billion, approaching the historic high of $108.8 billion reached in 2021. The increase in on-chain liquidity and activity reflects confidence in the ecosystem and wider usage of its Layer 2 scalability networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.\nCrptopolitan reported that Ether volumes expanded in August, showing robust on-chain activity. The result coincided with a new all-time high for ETH and further expectations of scaling the $5,000 hurdle for the first time.\nEthereum activity has returned to levels not seen since 2021, indicating a combination of value growth and on-chain transfers. The recent ETH rally also demonstrated that the L1 was sufficient for large-scale DeFi, with no significant gas spikes or congestion.\nThe rise in activity is seen as a sign of retail returning. In the past quarters, retail had almost abandoned ETH, while whales continued to accumulate. Now, Ethereum activity shows a shift in sentiment, with users returning to the most active apps. The Ethereum network carries simple ETH transfers based on gas usage, with USDT and USDC in the top 3 smart contracts.\nOverall, Ethereum smart contract creation expanded in 2025, returning to activity levels seen in 2021. This time around, the smart contracts were tied to DeFi, rather than NFTs or the launch of meme tokens.\nWhile on-chain volume activities have maintained higher highs, Ethereum\u2019s average gas prices are now at their lowest annual mean in the network\u2019s history. This drop is largely attributed to the adoption of Layer 2 rollups and protocol-level improvements, such as EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), which drastically improve data availability and reduce mainnet congestion.\nEthereum\u2019s daily active addresses recently exceeded 650,000, marking the highest level over two years. Historically, such periods of lower fees have been linked to surges in retail activity, as smaller investors and users re-engage with DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces.\nLow gas fees have led to an uptick in transaction volumes for DeFi and NFT projects, ranging from 15% to 20%, indicating a potential return of smaller, price-sensitive users who were previously priced out during periods of network congestion.\nData from Strategic Eth Reserve shows BitMine as the leading institution holding Ethereum tokens under its reserve strategy. BitMine\u2019s current holdings stand at 3.03 million ETH, making it the largest corporate holder of Ether.\nSharpLink, another institutional investor, recently added 39,000 ETH to its holdings, pushing its total to 838.73K ETH. These accumulation trends suggest that large entities increasingly view Ethereum as a utility network and a long-term store of digital value.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the current price of the Ether token is $3,974.41, representing a 2.77% drop at the time of publication. The token market cap has also dropped t"

                "body": "Sorare CEO still bullish on Ethereum despite \u2018upgrade\u2019 to Solana\nNicolas Julia, CEO of fantasy sports crypto platform Sorare, said he hasn\u2019t lost faith in Ethereum despite its plan to migrate to Solana \u2014 a move he has described as an \u201cupgrade.\u201d\nLast Thursday, Sorare announced that it would migrate from Ethereum after six years, capitalizing on Solana\u2019s scalability and consumer-focused user base. The company will move over 10 sports games and their trading cards to Solana.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a replacement, it\u2019s an upgrade,\u201d Sorare said at the time. Julia later explained to Cointelegraph that Solana is the most viable chain as it leads the fantasy sports crypto vertical in revenue, daily active addresses, active developers and total value locked. And that, while it is more centralized than Ethereum, the blockchain has prioritized scalability and security.\n\u201c[Solana\u2019s] growing adoption shows that this bet was the right one,\u201d Julia said, noting that it has covered a lot of ground on Ethereum, given it launched five years later.\nThe migration is expected to be complete by the end of this month.\nDespite the migration, Sorare\u2019s Julia said they haven\u2019t lost confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\u201cWe remain very bullish on it,\u201d Julia said, noting that it would continue supporting Ethereum users through an integration on the Base network and that it would still allow Ether (ETH) deposits.\nSorare, which has amassed 5 million users and was valued at $4.3 billion in October 2021, is one of several blue-chip crypto protocols that have made tough calls to migrate from the chain they launched on to keep growing.\nDecentralized exchange aggregator 1inch and crypto indexing protocol The Graph are two other notable crypto applications that have transitioned from Ethereum to Solana in recent years.\nSorare is a fantasy sports platform primarily focused on football, but also features basketball and baseball, where users buy, sell, and trade officially licensed digital player cards as non-fungible tokens. They can create teams with these cards and compete in weekly tournaments, earning rewards based on real-world player performance.\nSports tokens have lagged behind this bull cycle\nOther competitors in the space include Flow, Chiliz and the Dapper Labs-backed NBA Top Shot. The DraftKings Marketplace was also prominent before it shut down in July 2024.\nThe market cap for sports crypto tokens currently sits at $1.17 billion, a considerable fall from the 2021-2021 bull cycle, CoinGecko data shows.\nSorare NFTs have also struggled amid the broader NFT market downturn, with their floor price plunging from a peak of $91.25 in early April 2022 to $2.21 as of Oct. 12, DappRadar data shows.\nDaily Sorare NFT sales have remained steady, with anywhere between 5,000 and 30,000 sales on most days \u2014 a similar level to that seen in 2022.\nSorare to adopt a multichain approach\nDespite the migration, Julia said he is considering other high-speed chains that can help it scale Sorare\u2019s sports trading cards as far as possible.\nIt is also integrating Layer0 to operate marketplace payments seamlessly across Solana and Base as part of its plan to become chain-agnostic and leverage the strengths of multiple ecosystems.\nSorare is not concerned with Solana\u2019s network outages\nJulia said he isn\u2019t overly concerned about Sorare falling victim to a Solana network outage, noting that over the years, his team has become \u201cwell accustomed to working through the inevitable imperfections that come with blockchain infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been more than reassured by the quality of Solana\u2019s technology, the team behind it, and the network\u2019s recent track record of stability,\u201d Julia said.\nHe noted the network outages have become less frequent over time and are addressed swiftly, showing the Solana ecosystem\u2019s ability to improve at \u201cremarkable speed.\u201d"

                "body": "Stocks ended mostly lower Tuesday, a day after indexes rebounded from Friday's sharp losses, as the resumption of U.S. trade tensions with China outweighed strong third-quarter results from several big banks.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq and benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively, with the latter turning lower in the last half hour of trading following the latest Truth Social post from President Donald Trump about China. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4% higher.\nYesterday, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up a respective 2.2%, 1.6%, and 1.3% after Trump wrote on his social media platform, \"Don\u2019t worry about China, it will all be fine!\" Last Friday, indexes tanked after Trump threatened \"massive\" tariffs on China.\nChina subsequently imposed sanctions on U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilding firm Hanwha Ocean, and Beijing and Washington began charging additional port fees on each others\u2019 ships. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later said on CNBC that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping still were slated to meet at an undisclosed date.\nHowever, less than 30 minutes before markets closed, Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution.\"\nInvestors also were interpreting a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell early Tuesday afternoon at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia. Powell said data show the job market deteriorating, suggesting he and other Fed officials would be willing to cut the central bank's key interest rate in the coming months to boost the job market.\nGold futures were 0.6% higher at $4,155 an ounce at 4 p.m. ET after setting a record high of $4,190 earlier Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell 1.7% to $58.45 a barrel. Bitcoin was at roughly $112,800 after trading near $116,000 late Monday afternoon.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 4.02% after the bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was down 0.2% to 99.03.\nIn corporate news, banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicked off Q3 earnings season before the bell, and all topped analysts' estimates. JPMorgan stock ended down 1.9% after CEO Jamie Dimon warned \"of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation.\" Shares of Wells Fargo closed up 7.2% to lead the S&P 500, while those of Citi and Goldman Sachs were up 3.9% and down 2%, respectively.\nWalmart (WMT) and Caterpillar (CAT) shares powered the Dow higher, rising about 5% and 4.5%, respectively.\nShares of Critical Metals (CRML) continued their sharp rise since China announced it was tightening rare-earths exports, jumping a further 29%. MP Materials (MP) erased early declines and closed up 3.8%.\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock, which closed 9.9% higher Monday after the chipmaker and OpenAI announced a partnership for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators, ended down 3.5%. Fellow chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) fell 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, with Nvidia leading Dow decliners.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Tuesday\nDecliners\n- AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks were among the S&P 500's biggest decliners amid worries about shifting U.S.-China trade policies. Nvidia shares dropped over 4%, along with shares of Intel (INTC), which received a downgrade from Bank of America analysts suggesting the stock has climbed \"too far, too fast\" on enthusiasm for its recent AI deals.\n- Arista Networks (ANET) shares dropped nearly 6%, falling the f"

The index was last up over 200 points, or 0.52%, recovering as investors looked past trade fears and focused on upbeat bank earnings and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s latest remarks.\nThe S&P 500 remained slightly lower, down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged, off 0.6%, dragged by continued selling in big tech.\nYes. Financials led the midday recovery after several major banks posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results. Citigroup jumped 3.4% and Wells Fargo surged 7% following solid earnings reports that reflected healthy loan demand and strong consumer activity.\nJPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs also topped forecasts but fell more than 1% as investors reacted to guidance and margins. Still, the sector\u2019s performance helped steady broader sentiment after a volatile start to the week.\nU.S.-China tensions flared after China sanctioned five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Ocean, barring Chinese firms and individuals from conducting business with them. The move fueled fears of wider supply chain disruptions and trade retaliation.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the sanctions, calling them a sign of China\u2019s economic strain and suggesting Beijing is trying to drag other economies down with it. The VIX spiked above 22 in early trading, its highest since June, before pulling back under 21.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told economists that the central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet runoff, signaling a potential shift in tightening policy. While Powell gave no new guidance on interest rates, he noted liquidity conditions are tightening, which could lead to halting balance sheet reductions soon.\nHe also defended the Fed\u2019s ability to pay interest on reserves, warning that removing that authority would limit its control over monetary policy. Powell reiterated that the labor market appears to be softening, though risks to inflation remain.\nMarkets appear to be stabilizing after Friday\u2019s sharp selloff and Monday\u2019s rebound, with earnings taking center stage. Strong results from banks may continue to support the Dow, but tech weakness is capping upside for the Nasdaq.\nTraders should keep an eye on further earnings this week, signals from Beijing, and any policy hints ahead of the Fed\u2019s October 28\u201329 meeting, where clarity on rate cuts could emerge.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Just days earlier, the threat of steep tariffs and tighter restrictions had unsettled investors, but the more measured tone helped stabilize sentiment. Deutsche Bank Research points out that volatility is still closely tied to recession concerns, especially as political talks between the US and China evolve. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s political landscape remained in focus \u2013 with budget debates in France and Middle East peace talks in Egypt adding to the cautious mood. On the data front, Germany\u2019s export growth continued to lose steam as the HCOB PMI Export Conditions Index ticked down in September, while wholesale prices rose 1.2% year over year, mainly thanks to higher costs for essentials and industrial materials.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious optimism takes the wheel.\nA pause in heated trade rhetoric offered a small boost to stocks, but the DAX\u2019s muted gain signals that investors are still playing it safe. Siemens climbed 1.57% after partnering with Airbus on cutting industrial emissions, with Airbus shares barely higher, up 0.17%. Persistent worries about slowing exports and simmering geopolitical tensions mean that market swings could return if uncertainty flares up again.\nThe bigger picture: Politics and trade shape the industrial outlook.\nGermany\u2019s export-driven economy is feeling the squeeze from changing global demand and ongoing political uncertainties. Robust shipments to Asia and North America are steadying exports for now, but weak momentum in the eurozone \u2013 Germany\u2019s biggest trading region \u2013 and budget battles in France are risks to watch. With wholesale prices rising and global leaders negotiating trade and peace, German industry is navigating an unpredictable environment.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nTheodora Lee Joseph, CFA \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "- The German index gapped to the upside during the trading session on Monday, as it looks like we are threatening the \u20ac24,500 level, an area that\u2019s been resistance multiple times previously. All things being equal, this is an index that I do anticipate will continue to go higher over the longer term, but I also recognize that there are some questions about risk appetite at the moment that will continue to be a major issue.\nTechnical Analysis\nA short-term pullback is likely to continue to be thought of as a buying opportunity in a market that\u2019s been extraordinarily bullish over the long term, but over the last couple months has been working off a certain amount of excess froth. The market has been bouncing around between the \u20ac23,000 level at the bottom and the \u20ac24,500 level top. We have attempted to break out above the \u20ac24,500 level, and now it looks like we could even try to go to the \u20ac25,000 level given enough time.\nThe 50 Day EMA currently sits at the \u20ac23,983 level and is rising. This is an indicator that a lot of traders will be paying close attention to as it has offered both support and resistance, and I think in the short-term code offer enough support in order to keep the market somewhat bullish, and as long as we can say above the 50 Day EMA, then it\u2019s likely that we will eventually break out to the upside, especially as Germany ends up attracting most of the attention in the European Union, and as long as people are willing to invest in the European Union, that means Germany will continue to attract inflows.\nIf we break down below the 50 Day EMA, then I will be looking at a \u20ac23,000 support level that keeps this market going bullish. As long as we stay above there, there\u2019s actually no situation in which I\u2019m starting to short the DAX anytime soon.\nTop Forex Brokers\nReady to trade our stock market forecast and analysis?

More Federal Reserve speakers are scheduled to make public appearances on Wednesday, potentially giving cues about the rate trajectory, while the government shutdown lingers on.\nSpeaking at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Boston Fed President Susan Collins sounded a neutral tone. While stating that it is prudent to normalize policy a bit further this year as inflation risks remain somewhat contained and the employment market has seen some downside risks, Collins said, \u201cEven with some additional easing, monetary policy would remain mildly restrictive, which is appropriate to ensure inflation resumes its decline once tariff effects fade.\u201d\nAs of 12:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.21%, the S&P 500 futures added 0.19% and the Dow futures gained 0.18%. The Russell 2000 futures were up a steeper 0.43%.\nTech stocks served as a drag on the market on Tuesday, resulting in the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index closing in the red. Traders largely shrugged off mixed earnings from big banks, but renewed selling emerged in late trading after President Donald Trump took a potshot at China for not buying soybeans from the U.S.. Consumer discretionary and energy stocks witnessed much more modest losses, while consumer staple, financial, industrial, real estate, and utility stocks advanced strongly.\nIn a speech delivered to the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged growing signs of weakness in the labor market and signaled that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its balance sheet. His comments perked up expectations for more rate cuts this year.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, fell 0.12%, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) slumped 0.67%. On the other hand, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) climbed 1.38% and 0.44%, respectively.\nAmong the economic catalysts for the day, Richmond Fed\u2019s Tom Barkin is scheduled to speak at 8 a.m. ET. The Philadelphia Fed is set to release the results of its regional manufacturing survey at 8:30 a.m. ET, with the diffusion index of business activity expected to fall to 10 in October from 23.2 in September.\nFed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller are scheduled to speak at 9 a.m. ET, followed by fellow governor Michelle Bowman at 10 a.m. ET. Bowman and Barkin will make public appearances yet again at 10 a.m. ET and 12:45 p.m. ET.\nThe National Association of Home Builders is due to release the results of its homebuilder confidence survey for October at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe key earnings reports scheduled for release on Wednesday are Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), PNC (PNC), Progressive (PGR), J.B. Hunt Financial (JBHT) and United Airlines (UAL).\nCrude oil futures slipped further in the Asian session, and gold futures extended their gravity-defying rally, rising past the $4,200 level early Wednesday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note\u2019s yield retreated further toward the 4% mark, while the U.S. dollar eased against major counterparts.\nMost Asian markets advanced early Wednesday, as U.S. Fed rate cut hopes led to renewed buying.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.\nRead Next: Why Veritone Stock Skyrocketed In After-Hours Trading Today"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 0.8%, leading losses.\n(^DJI)\nThe market mood on Tuesday was decidedly unsettled, with trade tensions between the US and China taking most of the focus. Beijing announced a fresh round of retaliation to President Trump's trade salvos, while Trump threatened a stoppage in US buying of Chinese cooking oil products. The moves have undermined recently revived hopes that the US and China will avoid an all-out trade war.\nChina placed sanctions on five US-linked units of South Korean shipbuilding firm Hanwha Ocean, effectively barring Chinese companies from doing business with them. Both countries also began charging special port fees on one another's vessels on Tuesday in a bid for maritime dominance. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday said Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping remain scheduled to meet later this month.\nThen a Truth Social post from Trump late in the market session sent stocks down from their highs. Trump accused China of \"purposefully not buying\" US soybeans and dubbed it an \"Economically Hostile Act,\" threatening a cessation in US cooking oil purchases.\nAlso in focus was Powell\u2019s speech on Tuesday at the NABE annual meeting. In his remarks, the Fed chair said that the central bank's outlook for employment and inflation had not changed, implying that further Fed cuts are possible.\nPowell's remarks came into heavy focus with key data reports stalled by the government and ultimately appeared to reinforce the market's view on coming rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, earnings season kicked off in earnest on Tuesday morning with results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC).\nIn the tech world, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said it will provide Oracle's (ORCL) cloud business with 50,000 AI chips.

The bar had hosted other high school alumni groups over a busy weekend for homecoming season parties, Turral said.\nAn alumni association for Battery Creek High School did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTurral said he was inside the packed bar and grill when he heard gunfire outside at around 12:50 a.m. Sunday.\n\"I could hear what sounded like machine gun fire,\" he said, according to WJCL. \"It was just mayhem, tragedy outside. ... Bodies on the ground, people just trying to duck for cover.\"\nThe Beaufort County Sheriff's Office said arriving deputies found several people who had been shot. Four were dead at the scene and four others were hospitalized in critical condition, the sheriff's office said earlier.\nAt least 20 people were believed to have been injured, the office said. Deputies determined \"hundreds of people\" were at the venue during the attack, it said.\nThe office has not announced any arrests, but it said in a statement Monday that it was investigating \"persons of interest.\" A motive and information about what precipitated the violence were unavailable.\nThe sheriff's office asked anyone with information about the attack's origins to get in touch.\nSt. Helena Island is a focal point for the Southeastern U.S. coast's Gullah Geechee culture and language, developed among African slaves and their descendants in relative isolation along the Sea Islands and the Lowcountry.\nIt became home to one of the first school for freed slaves, Penn Center, where a cottage on campus is said to be the place where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\nOne year ago, the Gullah Geechee community was struck by tragedy when seven people were killed in a gangway collapse on a Georgia barrier island. A coroner\u2019s official said the people who died in the Sapelo Island incident were all in their 70s, except for a woman in her 90s.\nIt happened as 700 people were on the island, about 72 miles south of Savannah, to celebrate Gullah Geechee history.\nWillie's Breakfast Bar and Grill bills itself as a \"community pillar\" that celebrates Gullah Geechee culture and serves up Gullah-inspired cuisine.\n\"Prior to the gunshots, it was great,\" owner Turral said of Saturday night's festivities. \"People were smiling. People were dancing.\"\nHe held back tears, wondering whether if he could have taken a more proactive role despite hiring armed security at a level he described as full staffing. \"It's hard,\" he said.\n\"We've got to find a way to make the world better so these things don't happen,\" he said."

It\u2019s getting worse where abortion is banned.\nAll women, but especially pregnant women, are underrepresented in medical research, and the 2022 Dobbs ruling made it harder to test new medications on them. | Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo\nThe uproar over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to discourage pregnant women from taking Tylenol is highlighting a bigger problem: There has never been adequate data on the safety and effectiveness of many drugs during pregnancy, and that data became even harder to gather after the fall of Roe v. Wade.\nMedical experts and women\u2019s health advocates warn that state abortion bans are exacerbating longstanding barriers to including women of reproductive age in drug trials and other health studies, as both scientists and participating women could face new legal consequences if a drug harms a fetus. And without good information about how drugs affect pregnant women, it\u2019s harder to navigate a morass of conflicting messages from the government and medical groups on the safety of everything from painkillers to antidepressants to vaccines.\nTrump administration health officials have pledged \u201cgold-standard science\u201d aimed at testing whether pharmaceutical drugs are safe to take during pregnancy or whether they carry risks to fetuses\u2019 neurological development. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the president\u2019s recent warnings about Tylenol and autism, for instance, stem from a \u201ccommitment\u2026to follow the science and share critical public health information as soon as it becomes available, ensuring families are informed and communities are protected.\u201d\nYet emerging data suggests that kind of scientific evidence is becoming more difficult to obtain in much of the U.S., since women of reproductive age are more hesitant to enroll in studies in states with abortion bans. PRESTO, a federally-funded, non-partisan online database where people attempting to conceive share data with researchers, saw a more than 27 percent drop in participation in states that banned the procedure in the immediate aftermath of Dobbs, the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. There was no change in states with abortion protections.\n\u201cIn the post-Dobbs era, research with pregnant people is even harder and even more difficult ethically and legally, because of concerns about causing any sort of harm to the fetus could implicate potentially fetal personhood laws or abortion laws,\u201d said Allison Whelan, a bioethicist at Georgia State University College of Law who focuses on pregnancy.\nA dozen states have banned abortion at any point in pregnancy since the fall of Roe, while 10 more have bans that kick in somewhere before the point of fetal viability, typically around 22 to 24 weeks. Some of those laws were enacted decades or even more than a century ago \u2014 before women could vote and before ultrasounds were invented \u2014 while others were passed in the leadup to the Dobbs ruling or shortly after. Lawmakers pushing the policies expressed a desire to protect both fetuses and their mothers, who they argue are often coerced into terminating pregnancies.\nSome of those same red state lawmakers amended their bans over the last year after seeing what they characterized as unintended consequences, such as a rise in sepsis and hemorrhaging during delivery documented in Texas. But while they added new carveouts for threats to the health of the mother, they largely blocked bills that would have added exceptions for fetal anomalies, arguing that diagnoses can be wrong and that even if there\u2019s a slim chance of a healthy birth, patients should take it.\nThat means that in 10 states where abortion is prohibited, women whose fetuses develop birth defects \u2014 whether they\u2019re the result of a genetic mutation or exposure to pharmaceuticals \u2014 must travel out of state or carry to term a fetus likely to die shortly aft"

                "body": "In the morning session on the 15th, the Nikkei Stock Average rebounded sharply after three days, rising 615.99 yen from the previous day to close at 47,463.31 yen. The TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index) also surged by 40.71 points to reach 3,174.70 points. The market had plummeted the previous day, on the 14th, due to uncertainties surrounding the emergence of the Takichi administration and concerns over renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, but this session saw a reaction to that drop. Expectations for an interest rate cut in the U.S. also acted as a catalyst, prompting a wave of buying. The Nikkei Average reached 47,477.21 yen, up 629.89 yen, at 11:28 a.m., ending the morning session on a gradual upward trend. The dollar-yen exchange rate stood in the low 151 yen range, with the yen appreciating slightly from its morning level.\nTrading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market was 984.39 million shares, with trading value reaching 2.2797 trillion yen. Of the listed stocks, 1,465, or about 90%, rose, while only 134 fell. Sixteen remained unchanged.\nBy sector, 30 out of 33 industries gained, while three declined. Non-ferrous metal stocks such as Sumitomo Metal Mining <5713.T> and Fujikura <5803.T>, as well as machinery stocks like Komatsu <6301.T> and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T>, advanced. Securities futures stocks including Daiwa Securities Group <8601.T> and Nomura <8604.T>, and electronics stocks like Hitachi <6501.T> and Sony Group <6758.T> also performed strongly. Construction stocks such as Obayashi Corp <1802.T> and Shimizu Corp <1803.T>, and metal products stocks like SUMCO <3436.T> and Sanwa Holdings <5929.T> showed resilience. Glass and ceramics stocks like AGC <5201.T> and TOTO <5332.T>, as well as electric power and gas stocks like Tokyo Electric Power HD <9501.T> and Kansai Electric Power <9503.T>, remained solid. On the other hand, rubber product stocks like Bridgestone <5108.T> and Hama Rubber <5101.T>, service stocks such as Oriental Land Co. <4661.T> and Recruit Holdings <6098.T>, and shipping stocks like Nippon Yusen <9101.T> and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines <9104.T> were weak.\nElsewhere, Mercari <4385.T>, Rix <7525.T>, Link-U Group <4446.T>, AEON <8267.T>, and Shibaura <6590.T> rose. Conversely, MDV <3902.T>, Rakuten J <3139.T>, Daikokuten <2791.T>, AEON Fantasia <4343.T>, and Cosmos Pharmaceutical <3349.T> fell.\nProvided by: Wealth Advisor Co."

                "body": "TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended sharply lower Tuesday, with the Nikkei index briefly sinking over 3 percent, as selling was spurred amid political uncertainty in Japan after the junior coalition partner of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided late last week to end their alliance.\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended down 1,241.48 points, or 2.58 percent, from Friday at 46,847.32. The broader Topix index finished 63.60 points, or 1.99 percent, lower at 3,133.99. Japanese financial markets were closed Monday for a public holiday.\nOn the top-tier Prime Market, the main decliners were electric appliance, nonferrous metal and securities house issues.\nThe U.S. dollar fell to the upper 151 yen range in Tokyo after Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said earlier in the day that Japan is closely monitoring excessive fluctuations and disorderly movements in the currency market, while sharp declines of Tokyo stocks also prompted buying of the safe-haven yen, dealers said.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 151.96-98 yen compared with 152.37-38 yen in London at 4 p.m. Monday. The U.S. currency market was also closed Monday for a national holiday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1548-1549 and 175.49-53 yen against $1.1561-1563 and 176.14-22 yen in London late Monday afternoon.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond ended at 1.660 percent, down 0.030 percentage point from Friday's close, as the debt was bought on receding expectations that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates soon.\nStocks were sold almost across the board, with the benchmark Nikkei closing below the 47,000 line, as the Komeito party's announcement Friday that it was leaving the LDP-led coalition sparked political uncertainty, including over whether LDP leader Sanae Takaichi will become Japan's first female prime minister.\nThe Nikkei's drop came after the index surged over 2,000 points last week on hopes for expansionary fiscal policies after Takaichi became party leader.\nWhile the LDP could form a new ruling coalition or opposition parties could field a joint candidate for prime minister, \"expectations for expansionary fiscal policies are unlikely to fade suddenly,\" said Maki Sawada, a strategist in the Investment Content Department of Nomura Securities Co.\n\"Until uncertainties recede, the market may remain volatile, but hopes for fiscal stimulus are likely to continue supporting the market,\" she added.\nHowever, Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co., said, \"There is concern over whether parties could reach a consensus on fiscal policy, and even if opposition parties were to form a coalition government, uncertainties would remain about its sustainability, which could weigh on the market.\"\nSelling accelerated as investors unloaded exporter shares on the stronger yen. The market was also weighed down by worries that U.S.-China trade tensions could worsen.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark price of gold set by Tokyo's Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies Co. hit an all-time high of 22,463 yen per gram after exceeding 22,000 yen for the first time in the morning, reflecting strong demand amid concern over U.S.-China trade tensions."
