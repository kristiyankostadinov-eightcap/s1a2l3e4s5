                "body": "January 03: BRICS Gold Push Signals Faster De-Dollarization Risk\nBRICS de-dollarization is moving from talk to timelines as members add gold reserves and push a 2026 agenda to reduce dollar reliance. For US investors, this trend can support gold and slowly reshape global funding flows. We outline what a measured shift could mean for US dollar dominance, reserve diversification, and portfolios. The near-term path is gradual, but the direction matters. We focus on practical watchpoints and positioning so readers can plan for steady change, not shock.\nWhy rising BRICS gold holdings matter now\nRecent reports suggest a 2026 target for coordination, pointing to steady BRICS de-dollarization rather than a sudden break. That path can still sway reserves and settlement choices over time. A slow push can lift demand for neutral assets and reduce future USD needs at the margin. The longer the timeline, the more structural the change, and the more investors should plan for long-duration effects, not instant swings.\nGold is liquid, widely held, and carries no foreign issuer risk. That makes it a natural anchor for reserve diversification. If BRICS members keep adding gold reserves, it reinforces demand during dips and lends support in risk-off periods. A coordinated push in 2026 could also normalize gold in settlement frameworks. Early reports on the agenda highlight this trajectory source.\nPotential US market effects of a slow shift\nIf official buyers diversify, incremental demand for Treasuries could soften at the edges. Shifts may be small year to year, but they compound. The result could be a mild upward pull on term premiums and more sensitivity to domestic buyers. Higher reliance on US savings and pensions would matter more in auction outcomes, especially around heavy issuance windows and tighter liquidity days.\nA gradual lean away from USD can nudge the broad dollar lower over time, all else equal. That would filter into import prices, commodity costs, and inflation expectations. It can also raise the value of non-dollar assets in USD terms. The path is not linear. Cycles, growth differentials, and policy rates still drive the dollar in the near term, even as BRICS de-dollarization builds in the background.\nPortfolio moves to consider in a steady regime change\nWe favor a rules-based approach. Define a target range for gold exposure and scale toward it in steps to reduce timing risk. Investors can use US-listed gold ETFs, allocated bars, or a mix with miners for equity beta. Stress-test how gold behaves with stocks and bonds in shocks. Rebalance on schedule so allocation stays aligned with risk, not headlines.\nConsider modest non-USD exposure in a diversified basket rather than a single currency bet. Use hedged and unhedged vehicles to manage volatility. Match currency choices to spending or liabilities if relevant. For cash, ladder high-quality short-term instruments to keep flexibility as rates change. Focus on cost, liquidity, and tax treatment. Document rules so decisions remain calm during market stress.\nWhat to watch into and beyond 2026\nTrack central bank reserve disclosures, trade settlement announcements, and any shared settlement platforms. Watch quarterly changes in official sector gold holdings alongside bond allocations. Note cross-border payment tests that reduce frictions. Map each milestone to a practical impact on funding, liquidity, and pricing. Measured progress still compounds. The goal is to link headlines to portfolio rules, not react to noise.\nPlan for three states: faster shift, baseline drift, and stall. A faster path could weigh more on US dollar dominance and support gold more often. A stall would keep today\u2019s mix intact. A middle path extends gradual BRICS de-dollarization. Balance these with policy responses and market cycles. Commentary from market voices highlights these risks and timelines source.\nFinal Thoughts\nBRICS de-dollarization looks gradual, not abrupt, but the direction is clear. A longer runw"

The expectation has put pressure on the US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), lifting commodity prices invoiced in greenback currency.\nGold also tends to rise as interest rates fall and investors move away from interest-yielding assets like bonds.\nThe precious metal has surpassed more than 50 all-time highs this year, surging more than 60% year to date, making it a top asset for 2025, behind silver (SI=F), which is up roughly 100% year to date.\nBy comparison, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained about 17% during the same period, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down roughly 2%.\nAccording to a World Gold Council report, \"momentum has played a larger role than in previous years, which is not surprising considering how gold's strong rally has prompted widespread investor interest.\"\n\"At the same time, central banks continued their buying spree \u2014 with demand well above average, even if below the records seen in the previous three years,\" according to the study released on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nRead more about gold prices and today's market action.\nAs gold heads toward its best annual return since 1979, continued fiscal spending and lower interest rates, along with a weaker dollar, should support higher prices in 2026.\n\"Our analysis shows that, in this environment, gold could rise 5%\u201315% in 2026 from current levels,\" the World Gold Council said. Given today's prices, that would amount to as much as $4,900 per troy ounce.\n\"In addition, continued strategic central bank buying and potential new investment entrants, such as insurance companies in China or pension funds in India, could further support gold's positive trend,\" the report said.\nOn Thursday, Goldman Sachs analysts reiterated a \"structurally bullish outlook for gold,\" with a price target of $4,900 by the end of next year.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                "body": "Gold has been on a blistering run, and ETF investors are rushing to grab a piece.\nThe metal has skyrocketed nearly 60% in the past year, climbing from $2,638 to more than $4,200 per ounce (1), far outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s roughly 13% gain. (2)\nWith central banks hoarding bullion, retail investors flooding in, and analysts projecting gold could hit $5,000 by 2026, the frenzy is only intensifying. (3)\nFor anyone watching the rally from the sidelines, gold ETFs look like the easiest on-ramp. They trade like stocks, don\u2019t require storing bars in your basement, and promise instant exposure to one of the hottest assets of the year.\nBut as more Americans chase performance, a critical detail is getting lost: a gold ETF isn\u2019t always taxed like an S&P 500 ETF, and choosing the wrong one can quietly wreck your returns.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about this form of investment as interest in gold investing hits a new high.\nGold is booming. ETFs are the gateway of choice\nThe appeal is obvious. When rate cuts appear on the horizon \u2014 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest 25-basis-points cut was hotly anticipated (4) \u2014 gold tends to shine.\nLower interest rates make non-yielding assets like gold more attractive, and that dynamic has pushed even more money into gold ETFs.\nETF providers have benefitted from both the demand and the story. Products like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the industry\u2019s largest physical-backed gold ETF with more than $140 billion in assets (5), let everyday investors buy slivers of gold without needing to touch a single ounce.\nEven so, experts warn that gold\u2019s ride is rarely smooth. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bounce up and down, and it\u2019s not always going to work in your favor,\u201d Morningstar\u2019s Dan Sotiroff told CNBC. (6)\nAdvisors also emphasize moderation. Many recommend that gold make up no more than 5-10% of a portfolio (7), noting that the shiny metal tends to dramatically underperform stocks and bonds over long periods \u2014 a small annual difference that compounds into a big drag over decades.\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped investors from pouring in. And that\u2019s exactly where the tax traps are sprung.\nInvest in real estate without the headache of being a landlord\nImagine owning a portfolio of thousands of well-managed single family rentals or a collection of cutting-edge industrial warehouses. You can now gain access to a $1B portfolio of income-producing real estate assets designed to deliver long-term growth from the comforts of your couch.\nThe best part? You don\u2019t have to be a millionaire and can start investing in minutes.\nLearn MoreThe surprising tax traps hiding inside gold ETFs\nMany investors assume that anything purchased through a brokerage account gets standard capital gains treatment. But gold ETFs operate under different sections of the tax code (8), and the rules can get complicated fast.\nThe biggest misunderstanding comes from physical gold ETFs structured as grantor trusts. These funds hold gold bars in a vault and issue shares that represent slices of those bars. But because the IRS treats investors in grantor trusts as if they personally own the gold, these ETFs fall under the tax rules for collectibles.\nThat means even long-term gains get taxed at up to 28%, not the usual 0%, 15%, or 20% you\u2019d expect from an equity ETF. Investors in high tax brackets often get hit with that maximum rate. (8)\nOther products come with their own twists. Futures-based gold ETFs, such as Invesco\u2019s DB Gold Fund (DGL), don\u2019t hold physical metal. Instead, they use derivatives, which triggers the IRS\u2019s \u201c60/40 rule.\u201d\nIn practice, that means 60% of any gain is taxed as long-term capital gains and 40% as short-term ordinary income, no matter how long you\u2019ve held the fund. You could hold the ETF for 10 years and still face the same blended tax treatment.\nThen there are ETNs, or exchange-traded notes (9), which track gold\u2019s price but behave more like debt instruments. Gains on gold ETNs sold before maturity are typically treated as capital gains (potentially qu"

But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen.\nIt exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.\nRasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\n\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"\nAnalyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term.\nThe oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.\nOil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC.\nSaul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors.\n\"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.\nCurrently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"\nGoldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela.\n\"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"\nGoldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).\nRapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oi"

Here's what to know.\nThe U.S. strike on Venezuela has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.\n\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.\nHere's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.\nHow much oil does Venezuela produce?\nVenezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.\nVenezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.\nBy comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.\nFrancisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.\nBut doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?\nYes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.\n\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.\nVenezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.\nAre American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?\nOnly one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.\n\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.\nOther American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.\nSince 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.\nMost recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.\nEarlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S. seized two sanctioned vessels.\nChevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver grant"

Reports show diaspora celebrations while local accounts cite fuel-station closures and uncertainty. For Switzerland, crude flows, compliance exposure, and CHF energy costs are in focus. We outline what is known, the plausible policy paths, and the indicators that matter for Swiss portfolios and risk management this week.\nWhat we know so far\nCrowds of Venezuelans abroad reported celebrations after Donald Trump said Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was captured. Coverage from Florida and Europe reflects hope and fear, with details still being verified. See reports from Spanish-language outlets, including swissinfo and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. Markets await official U.S. statements that could clarify the venezuela usa situation and policy direction.\nOn-the-ground accounts point to fuel-station closures and uncertainty, a sign that logistics and local supply chains could be strained. If sustained, disruptions may complicate crude lifting schedules and product distribution. For investors, the short-term picture is unclear, but the balance of risk points to headline sensitivity, especially if confirmations or denials reshape the venezuela usa narrative and the scope of any enforcement actions.\nWhy this matters for Swiss markets\nSwitzerland relies on imported crude and products, with the Cressier refinery supplying part of domestic needs. A wider oil supply risk can pass through to CHF pump prices and transport costs. That can pressure household budgets and service margins. We expect higher volatility in refined-product benchmarks to filter into Swiss retail prices if supply tightens or trade routes lengthen.\nGeneva and Zug host major commodity traders that manage complex contracts, financing, and shipping. Changes to Venezuela sanctions or licenses can alter counterparty risk, freight routing, and insurance terms. Firms will prioritize compliance with any new U.S. guidance. Investors should review exposure to heavy-sour grades and assess working-capital and reputational risks tied to the venezuela usa headlines.\nSanctions scenarios and timelines\nIf Washington confirms details and leans into stricter Venezuela sanctions, secondary enforcement could intensify. That would constrain access to financing, shipping services, and buyers, reducing available barrels and lifting heavy-sour differentials. The venezuela usa dynamic would likely support crude time spreads, raise freight costs, and keep risk premia elevated across EM credit and oil-linked equities.\nIf a credible transition roadmap emerges, the U.S. could renew limited licenses allowing monitored exports and debt-service transactions. That would lower oil supply risk and ease compliance frictions, but checks would stay tight. Under this venezuela usa path, flows could normalize gradually, with discounts reflecting quality, payment channels, and the pace of verification by U.S. authorities.\nSignals to monitor in the coming days\nWatch the White House, State Department, and U.S. Treasury for on-record updates. OFAC FAQs, license renewals, or revocations will set the compliance tone. Also track PDVSA statements and any guidance from European authorities. These items anchor the legal basis for trade, helping investors parse the venezuela usa headline risk into operational rules.\nFollow prompt Brent structure, heavy-sour spreads, and Mediterranean freight rates for real-time stress. Watch spot cargo availabilities, refinery runs in Europe, and Swiss retail price adjustments in CHF. Persistently tight shipping and stronger backwardation would signal ongoing oil supply risk, while improved loadings and softening freight would point to easing constraints.\nFinal Thoughts\nFor Swiss investors, today\u2019s task is to convert fast-moving venezuela usa headlines into clear actions.

While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term.\nThe oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.\nOil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC.\nSaul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors.\n\"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.\nCurrently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"\nGoldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela.\n\"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"\nGoldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).\nRapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oi"

                "body": "U.S. seeks to tap Venezuela's vast oil reserves after military strikes. Here's what to know.\nThe U.S. strike on Venezuela has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.\n\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.\nHere's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.\nHow much oil does Venezuela produce?\nVenezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.\nVenezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.\nBy comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.\nFrancisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.\nBut doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?\nYes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.\n\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.\nVenezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.\nAre American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?\nOnly one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.\n\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.\nOther American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.\nSince 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.\nMost recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.\nEarlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S. seized two sanctioned vessels.\nChevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver grant"

That trove of crude will play a central role in the country\u2019s future.\nOil futures don\u2019t trade on the weekend, so the near-term impact on the price of oil is a bit of a guessing game, but Trump said the US would operate the Venezuelan government for the time being.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have our very large United States oil companies \u2014 the biggest anywhere in the world \u2014 go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\u201d Trump said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.\nA US-led revamp could eventually make Venezuela a much bigger supplier of oil and could create opportunities for Western oil companies and could serve as a new source of production. It could also keep broader prices in check, although lower prices might disincentivize some US companies from producing oil.\nEven if international access were fully restored tomorrow, it could take years and incredible expense to bring Venezuelan oil production fully back online. Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA says its pipelines haven\u2019t been updated in 50 years, and the cost to update the infrastructure to return to peak production levels would cost $58 billion.\n\u201cFor oil, this has the potential for a historic event,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \u201cThe Maduro regime and (former Venezuelan President) Hugo Chavez basically ransacked the Venezuelan oil industry.\u201d\nControl of Venezuela\u2019s oil trove\nVenezuela is home to the largest proven oil reserve on Earth, but its potential far outweighs its actual output: Venezuela produces only about 1 million barrels of oil per day \u2014 about 0.8% of global crude production.\nThat\u2019s less than half of what it produced before Maduro took control of the country in 2013 and less than a third of the 3.5 million barrels it was pumping before the Socialist regime took over.\nInternational sanctions on the Venezuelan government and a deep economic crisis contributed to the decline of the country\u2019s oil industry \u2014 but so did a lack of investment and maintenance, according to the EIA. Venezuela\u2019s energy infrastructure is deteriorating, and its capacity to produce oil has been greatly diminished over the years.\nVenezuela simply doesn\u2019t produce enough oil to make that big a difference.\nOil prices have been in check this year because of oversupply fears. OPEC has ramped up production, but demand has fallen off a bit as the global economy continues to struggle with inflation and affordability after the post-pandemic price shock.\nUS oil briefly rose above $60 a barrel when the Trump administration began seizing oil from Venezuelan vessels, but it has since fallen to $57 a barrel again. So the market\u2019s reaction \u2014 if investors believe the strike is bad news for oil supply \u2014 will almost certainly be muted.\n\u201cPsychologically it might give it a bit of a boost, but Venezuela has oil that can be easily replaced by a combination of global producers,\u201d Flynn said.\nVenezuela\u2019s oil potential\nThe kind of oil Venezuela is sitting on \u2014 heavy, sour crude \u2014 requires special equipment and a high level of technical prowess to produce. International oil companies have the capability to extract and refine it, but they\u2019ve been restricted from doing business in the country.\nThe United States, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, has light, sweet crude, which is good for making gasoline but not much else. Heavy, sour crude like the oil from Venezuela is crucial for certain products made in the refining process, including diesel, asphalt and fuels for factories and other heavy equipment.

Note that the median-line converges on this threshold in late-February / early-March - look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom Line: The broader EUR/USD outlook remains tilted to the topside into the yearly cross, but the advance may be vulnerable to a larger correction in the first half of the year.

                "body": "^DJI Today, January 03: Mixed Start as Metals Rally, Fed Cuts Eyed\nDow Jones today started the year on a mixed note as a gold rally and Fed cut hopes pulled investors in different directions. The index (^DJI) inched up while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq today eased, a sign of caution rather than stress. For Germany-based investors, the setup matters because US moves often steer late-session DAX tone. We look at the drivers, how rates shape leadership, and simple ways to position with euro exposure in mind.\nWall Street\u2019s mixed open and what moved markets\nDow Jones today edged higher as investors favored defensive and income names, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq today slipped on profit taking in growth stocks. The split lines up with a cautious first week, where traders test earnings resilience and watch guidance. Early breadth was uneven, with modest buying in healthcare and staples offset by softer software and chip plays.\nA firm gold rally and gains in silver highlighted demand for perceived safety, often seen when policy paths look unclear. That tone matched early US trading, as headlines stressed a mixed start to the year source. German investors often use metals as a hedge against rate or currency shocks, so the move supports a more balanced stance across equities and commodities.\nRates, the Fed, and why stocks split\nMarkets still expect Fed cuts later this year, but timing and size remain uncertain. When those odds fade even a little, growth valuations feel it first while cash-generative firms hold up better. Coverage in Germany pointed to direction-finding on day one, with traders watching yields and the dollar for clues source.\nSlightly higher yields often weigh on tech and communication services while supporting banks and insurers. Energy can benefit if commodities firm alongside metals. We saw that mix early, with investors trimming risk in high duration names and rotating to steadier cash flows. The result was a mild index split rather than a broad risk-off move, a typical start when uncertainty is the main theme.\nWhat this means for German portfolios\nFor broad US exposure, many Germany-based investors use UCITS ETFs tracking the S&P 500 or the Dow. You can choose euro-hedged share classes to dampen EUR/USD swings, or unhedged to keep dollar upside potential. If the gold rally continues, a small allocation to metals or miners can offset equity wobble while keeping overall costs and spreads in check.\nLiquidity in US stocks and ETFs peaks after the US open at 15:30\u201322:00 CET. Consider limit orders to control entry during the first 30\u201360 minutes, when spreads can be wider. Stagger buys in smaller blocks if the tape is choppy. Review stop distances ahead of key US data and Fed speakers, and avoid market orders into low-liquidity pockets.\nNear-term levels and simple strategy\nTrack the opening range, sector breadth, and leadership. If cyclicals and financials hold early gains while tech stabilizes, the session may grind higher. If defensive sectors lead with weak breadth, expect range-bound trade. Watch gold and yields together. A steady metals bid with softer yields can lift the Dow even if growth stocks lag.\nFor Dow Jones today, we prefer a barbell: keep core index exposure, add a modest defense sleeve, and hold dry powder for dips. Consider a metals hedge if the dollar softens. Trim into strength in extended growth names, rotate to quality dividend payers on pullbacks. Keep risk tight around data releases and reassess if yields spike.\nFinal Thoughts\nA mixed open, a visible gold rally, and steady Fed cut talk set the tone for Dow Jones today. We see a balanced tape rather than a risk-off swing. For German investors, that argues for simple, flexible positioning: core US index exposure, selective rotation toward cash-generative sectors, and a small hedge in metals if policy signals stay noisy. Use limit orders during the busiest US hours, and let currency needs guide whether you hedge EUR/USD. Keep an eye on sector breadth and yie"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Tests 1.35 as BoE Caution Meets Soft US Dollar\nSterling trades around 1.3450 after UK PMI at 50.6, FTSE 100 near 10,000 and markets price 2026 Fed cuts | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD: 2026 Starts With Sterling Holding 1.34\u20131.35 After Its Best Run Since 2021\nGBP/USD price action around 1.3450\u20131.3500\nGBP/USD begins 2026 trading roughly between 1.3400 and 1.3500, with spot repeatedly gravitating toward 1.3450\u20131.3475. On the first sessions of the year the pair briefly pushed toward 1.3490\u20131.3500 before slipping back below 1.3450 after rejection near 1.3475. The latest bounce from the 1.3400 area keeps the short-term structure constructive: sellers are active near 1.3500, but they are not yet strong enough to push GBP/USD decisively back into the low-1.33s. That leaves a clear, tradable near-term range: support in the 1.3400\u20131.3420 band, resistance around 1.3475\u20131.3550.\n2025 performance: from near-parity fear back to 1.35\nThe current GBP/USD level around 1.35 matters because it marks a full reversal of the panic phase that followed the 2022 UK mini-budget crisis. From levels close to parity in late 2022, sterling spent most of 2023\u20132024 rebuilding credibility and finally traded back to roughly 1.35 in late 2025. That puts GBP/USD back to late-2021 territory but still below the pre-Brexit zone near 1.50. Against the euro the pound has been less impressive: GBP/EUR has slipped from around 1.21 to near 1.15, showing that most of sterling\u2019s recent strength has come from a softer USD, not an aggressively strong GBP.\nRate differentials: BoE at 3.75%, Fed shifting toward cuts\nMonetary policy is the core driver. The Bank of England has cut rates four times in 2025, bringing the policy rate down to roughly 3.75%, and markets are pricing another two cuts in 2026, but there is no appetite for an aggressive easing cycle. UK inflation ended 2025 at about 3.5%, still above target, so the BoE is close to what it sees as a \u201cneutral\u201d or terminal area and will likely move slowly. In the United States, headline CPI cooled to around 2.8% in December 2025, and the Fed\u2019s projections plus futures pricing point to at least two rate cuts by the end of Q2 2026. That relative stance \u2014 a Fed that is more clearly heading into an easing phase while the BoE remains cautious \u2014 is exactly what has pushed GBP/USD up toward 1.35 and kept the Dollar Index near 98.16. As long as the market believes the Fed will ease earlier and faster than the BoE, rate differentials support GBP/USD on dips.\nMacro backdrop: UK resilience vs global risk appetite\nThe macro picture around GBP is not spectacular but it is no longer a crisis story. UK manufacturing PMI has climbed to 50.6, its highest level in about 15 months and above the 50.0 expansion line for two consecutive months, even if the final reading was revised down from 51.2. That move confirms a slow recovery in the tradable sector. At the index level, the FTSE 100 briefly crossed 10,039.05, breaking above the 10,000 mark for the first time before closing just under that level with a 0.2% gain and a roughly 21.5% rise over 2025. These numbers tell you foreign investors have regained some confidence in UK assets. On the other side of the cross, the United States is still growing but no longer in \u201cexceptionalism\u201d mode, and global risk sentiment at the start of 2026 is broadly constructive: gold trades around $4,320\u2013$4,400, cryptocurrencies like Cardano are stabilizing above $0.36, and equity indices such as the S&P 500 at 6,858.47 and Nasdaq at 23,235.63 are near highs. A softer USD in a risk-on environment usually supports GBP/USD, and the current set-up fits that pattern.\nCross-checks from GBP/EUR and EUR/USD\nCross-rates confirm that the story is more about the dollar than about full-blown sterling strength.

Note that the upper parallel of the 2022 pitchfork converges on this threshold into the start of the year with EUR/USD coiled just below.

Note that the median-line converges on this threshold in late-February / early-March - look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom Line: The broader EUR/USD outlook remains tilted to the topside into the yearly cross, but the advance may be vulnerable to a larger correction in the first half of the year. From a trading standpoint, losses should be limited to 1.1275 IF Euro is heading higher in 2026 with a close above 1.2020 needed to fuel the next major leg of the EUR/USD advance.\n--- Written by Michael Boutros, Senior Market Analyst\nFollow Michael on X @MBForex\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Despite the weak market momentum following the holidays, these wallets doubled down on their buying pressure, adding 3.62 million ETH to their cumulative balance. That figure is higher than its record 2.94 million ETH inflow in November.\nAccumulation addresses are wallets with no record of selling activity, often dominated by new addresses and long-term holders.\nDespite the buying pressure from accumulation addresses, ETH's exchange reserves rose by nearly 480,000 ETH \u2014 their largest increase since June. An increase in exchange reserves signals higher selling pressure.

                "body": "I\u3001Project Overview\nLighter is a decentralized perpetual futures (Perp DEX) protocol founded in 2025 by Vladimir Novakovski. The project aims to combine the performance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the transparency of decentralized finance (DeFi), delivering high-performance, non-custodial trading infrastructure. Built on an Ethereum Layer 2 zk-rollup architecture with proprietary ZK circuits, Lighter enables on-chain verifiable order matching and settlement while maintaining extremely low gas costs.\nCompared with traditional DEXs such as Uniswap, Lighter supports instant execution and high-frequency trading. In competition with leading Perp DEXs such as dYdX and GMX, it emphasizes sustainable incentive design rather than inflationary token models. Backed by top-tier investors including a16z, Lighter positions itself as a compliance-friendly and institution-ready trading platform.\nThe native token $LIT has a total supply of 1 billion. 50% is allocated to the ecosystem (airdrop, incentives, community), and 50% to the team and investors. The initial airdrop accounts for 25% of total supply and is fully unlocked at launch. Platform revenue is used for ecosystem growth or token buybacks. $LIT can be used for staking and governance.\nThe mainnet is live, supporting perpetual contracts for BTC, ETH, SOL and other assets, with cumulative trading volume exceeding $4.4 billion. Lighter aims to expand into payments, prediction markets, and other on-chain financial applications, positioning itself as next-generation financial infrastructure balancing efficiency and transparency.\nII\u3001Project Highlights\nzk-Rollup architecture enabling CEX-level performance:\nLighter leverages Ethereum Layer 2 zk-rollup technology and custom ZK circuits to combine on-chain transparency with centralized-exchange-grade execution speed, significantly reducing latency and transaction costs.\nCustom order book and clearing engine for fair execution:\nThe protocol integrates order matching and settlement directly into its core prover, using an \u201cOrder Book Tree\u201d structure to ensure price-time priority, fair execution, and reduced censorship risk.\nNon-custodial asset security:\nLighter adopts a fully non-custodial model and introduces an \u201cEscape Hatch\u201d mechanism, allowing users to withdraw funds directly from contracts if sequencers fail, ensuring asset safety under extreme conditions.\nToken incentive system:\n$LIT underpins the ecosystem\u2019s incentive structure, with 50% allocated to community rewards and ecosystem growth. A data-driven reward model filters Sybil behavior and rewards genuine activity. Platform revenue is reinvested into ecosystem growth or token buybacks, reinforcing long-term value accrual.\nIII\u3001Market Valuation Outlook\nSupported by innovations such as SNARK-based provers and the Order Book Tree architecture, Lighter has established early network effects. The project has completed a $68 million funding round at a $1.5 billion valuation and reports monthly trading volume of $227.19 billion with annualized revenue of approximately $125 million.\nWith the continued expansion of perpetual derivatives and high-performance DEX narratives, Lighter is positioned to become a core Web3 trading infrastructure. Its fully diluted valuation (FDV) is estimated at $1.5\u20132.0 billion in bearish conditions, $3\u20134.2 billion under base-case scenarios, and $6\u20138 billion or higher in a strong bull market.\nIV\u3001Token Economics\nTotal supply: 1 billion tokens\n-50% (500M) allocated to ecosystem and community, including 25% for immediate airdrop distribution and 25% for future incentives\uff1b\n-26% (260M) allocated to the team for long-term operations, with a 1-year cliff and 3-year linear vesting\uff1b\n-24% (240M) allocated to early investors, also with a 1-year cliff and 3-year linear vesting\nToken Unlock Schedule\u3002\nTGE Initial Circulation (Dec 30, 2025):\n-Airdrop: 250M LIT (25%) fully unlocked and distributed\uff1b\n-Public sale: ~6% (~60M), planned via Binance Launchpool in Q1 2026\uff1b\n-Initial cir"

                "body": "USD/JPY Today, January 04: \u2018250 Yen\u2019 Risk Debate as Policy Uncertainty\nMarkets in Japan are debating a bold risk case: yen 250 per dollar. With the Takaichi cabinet leaning to fiscal expansion and the Bank of Japan lifting its policy rate to 0.75% in December, traders are testing policy signals and credibility. We review what a slide could mean for import costs, inflation, and positioning. We also highlight why some economists see limited CPI pass-through, and what investors in Japan-exposed assets should watch next.\nWhat a Slide Toward 250 Means for Japan\nA move toward yen 250 per dollar would be less about panic and more about policy mix. Wider rate gaps with the US, larger deficits, and unclear guidance can weigh on the currency. If fiscal stimulus boosts demand while rate hikes lag, carry trades stay attractive. Clear sequences for budgets, bond issuance, and Bank of Japan operations can steady expectations and slow speculative flows.\nA weaker yen raises yen-denominated costs for energy, food, and semiconductors. Pass-through is not one-for-one, but gasoline, electricity, and packaged foods tend to react first. Wage gains and subsidies can offset part of the shock. Some analysts argue FX alone is not the main driver of core inflation, which aligns with recent debates in Japan\u2019s media source.\nBank of Japan Policy, Signaling, and Credibility\nThe December move to 0.75% set a new anchor, but guidance matters more now. Clear reaction functions on wages, output gaps, and inflation expectations can cap yen collapse risk. Liquidity plans for JGBs, including any QT pace and buying bands, can reduce volatility and help align FX with fundamentals rather than one-way momentum trades.\nFX intervention is most effective when rate expectations and communication are aligned. Monitoring US-Japan yield spreads, oil prices in JPY, and short positioning helps. If swap-implied carry dominates, authorities may tighten funding to curb leverage. A transparent playbook for data surprises can prevent self-reinforcing moves toward yen 250 per dollar.\nSanaenomics Debate and Fiscal Expansion\nSanaenomics frames growth through targeted spending, tax measures, and deregulation. Supporters see a lift to productivity and wages; critics fear currency pressure if deficits rise. The policy mix, not spending alone, will drive FX. Balanced timetables and revenue plans can reduce market stress, as highlighted in current commentary source.\nEmpirical work shows FX pass-through varies by sector and contract cycle. Regulated tariffs and long-term supply deals can slow CPI effects. That is why some economists downplay a broad inflation shock from a weaker yen, even as others warn of tail risks up to food and fuel rationing headlines source.\nInvestor Playbook in a 250 Scenario\nExporters with USD revenue and local cost bases can benefit, while fuel-intensive sectors face headwinds. Consider staggered FX hedges, collars, or options to manage gaps. Banks may see NIM support if domestic rates rise. For portfolios exposed to Japan, scenario tests around yen 250 per dollar help set hedge ratios and stop-loss levels.\nKey catalysts include Diet progress on budgets, BoJ minutes and speeches, quarterly Tankan updates on pricing power, and UST-JGB spread moves. Track real wage growth and utility price revisions to gauge demand resilience. Watch positioning data and options skews for stress. Clear, frequent signals can reduce the odds of a disorderly move.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe debate over yen 250 per dollar is ultimately about credibility and mix. If fiscal plans are sequenced with funding clarity and the Bank of Japan anchors guidance to wages and expectations, the currency can stabilize even with modest weakness. For investors, the playbook is simple: run scenarios, set hedge bands, and avoid binary bets. Focus on companies with pricing power, USD revenue, and flexible supply chains, while stress testing energy costs. Watch BoJ communications, Diet timelines, and US-Japan yield sp"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price: Carry Trade Still Dominates, But 160 Is a Structural Stress Line\nUSD/JPY comes into 2026 with the same defining feature it had through 2025: a persistent carry trade supported by wide rate differentials, anchored above the 140 handle and grinding higher. The broader dollar index has been stuck in a range, but the yen has remained structurally weak as Japan lives with 2.9% inflation, a currency that has slid from roughly 104 to about 156 per dollar since 2021, and a bond market that is being forced out of the zero-yield regime. The pair keeps printing higher lows, yet every step closer to 160 increases the probability of official pushback and a violent short squeeze that can unwind multiple years of carry in weeks.\nDollar Side Of USD/JPY: Range-Bound DXY, Asymmetric Rate Expectations\nOn the dollar side, the index is being pulled between near-term support and medium-term skepticism. After a multi-month range in H2 2025, the dollar basket has carved out three straight weeks of support around a Fibonacci level near 97.94, with repeated but failed attempts to sustainably clear the 100.00\u2013100.22 band that capped rallies last year. That 100 region remains the key resistance; a decisive break would open the path toward 102, which would naturally spill into renewed upside pressure on USD/JPY. At the same time, rate markets are already discounting a softening Fed: only about a 15% chance of a cut at the late-January FOMC meeting, but roughly 50 bps of total easing priced in for 2026 while the Bank of Japan is expected to raise once more by around 25 bps and the ECB is assumed to stay on hold. That mix leaves the dollar with a modest negative bias over the full year, but still with a yield advantage versus the yen that is far too wide to kill the carry trade by itself. The euro\u2019s 57.6% weight in the dollar index also matters: EUR/USD has rallied more than 13% in 2025 and sits near four-year highs, coiling below a major 1.19\u20131.20 resistance cluster. If that zone triggers a meaningful pullback toward 1.15\u20131.14 in early 2026, the dollar index would get a mechanical lift that could help USD/JPY retest its upper band even without new macro catalysts.\nJapan Side Of USD/JPY: Inflation, Imported Pain And A Fragile JGB Regime\nThe yen side of USD/JPY is no longer about deflation and zero yields; it is about an economy paying the price for decades of cheap funding. Headline CPI runs near 2.9%, but the structure of inflation is what matters. Food prices are up 6.1% year-on-year, with rice \u2013 a core staple \u2013 having jumped 37% over the last year after a prior surge of almost 64%. Energy is even more brutal in local terms: crude oil, converted into yen, is roughly 87% more expensive than five years ago, compared with about a 22% rise in dollar terms. The driver is the exchange rate. USD/JPY has moved from roughly 104 in 2021 to around 156, a near-50% depreciation that makes almost every imported input more expensive. At the same time, Japan operates at or near full employment, and the tourism boom driven by the weak yen is inflationary rather than purely growth-positive. A weaker currency no longer feels like a free stimulus; it is feeding a feedback loop where higher import prices push CPI up, which undermines real incomes and squeezes households.\nOn the fiscal and bond side, Japan sits on a debt-to-GDP ratio around 237%, the highest among major economies. Ten-year government bond yields have climbed from effectively 0% to above 2%, and the 2000\u20132020 regime of zero inflation has been replaced by a persistent CPI print above the 2% target since mid-2022. The Bank of Japan has already started to let yields rise and has stepped away from the strictest form of yield-curve control. The market is now forcing a re-pricing of the entire curve. Long-term JGBs maturing through 2028 were originally issued with weighted coupons between roughly 0.4% and 0.58% and maturities of 7.5\u20139.5 years; rolling them at current market yields implies an increase o"

As a result, attempts by the U.S. dollar to regain strength have been insufficient to reactivate the long-standing uptrend that prevailed for several years. This shift has created a scenario of persistent indecision, where the pair has been unable to establish a clear directional bias in recent months. If buying pressure fails to strengthen, USD/CAD could move into a sideways range during the early months of 2026, especially if buyers cannot recover enough momentum to restore the long-term bullish trend that previously guided the pair.\n- Indicators:\n- RSI: The RSI continues to oscillate steadily below the neutral 50 level, reflecting that bearish momentum has dominated toward the end of 2025. This indicates a persistent selling bias in USD/CAD based on the indicator\u2019s average behavior. As long as this pattern remains intact, selling pressure is likely to strengthen, reducing the probability of a sustained return to the long-term uptrend seen in previous years.\n- MACD: A similar outlook appears in the MACD, whose histogram has crossed below the zero line, signaling that bearish strength has begun to dominate the average of the short-term moving averages. If the histogram continues to record values below zero, selling pressure could become more relevant during the first months of 2026.\n- RSI: The RSI continues to oscillate steadily below the neutral 50 level, reflecting that bearish momentum has dominated toward the end of 2025. This indicates a persistent selling bias in USD/CAD based on the indicator\u2019s average behavior. As long as this pattern remains intact, selling pressure is likely to strengthen, reducing the probability of a sustained return to the long-term uptrend seen in previous years.\n- Key Levels:\n- 1.41135 \u2013 Key Resistance: This resistance is located near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, considered the most important technical barrier on the chart and positioned above the 50- and 200-period moving averages. A buying breakout above this level could restore a bullish bias and reactivate the long-term uptrend as the dominant technical structure.\n- 1.38093 \u2013 Current Barrier: This barrier is positioned near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and coincides with the most relevant neutrality zone observed over the past three years. If price continues fluctuating around this area, indecision may increase and USD/CAD could form a long-term lateral range.\n- 1.35675 \u2013 Crucial Support: This support is located at the 200-period simple moving average and aligns with the 2025 lows. A break below this level would signal a structural change in the chart and could confirm the formation of a more consistent long-term downtrend.\n- 1.41135 \u2013 Key Resistance: This resistance is located near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, considered the most important technical barrier on the chart and positioned above the 50- and 200-period moving averages.

Although several short-term upward corrections have occurred, there is still no buying dominance, confirming that the long-term bearish trend remains the most relevant technical structure and continues to guide the pair\u2019s predom"

                "body": "Story Highlights\n- The Ethereum price today is $ 3,141.22257707.\n- The asset could reach a high of $6100 by the end of 2026.\n- The price of Ethereum could reach a high of $15,575 by 2030.\nJanuary has traditionally been a robust month for Ethereum (ETH). However, the year 2025 presented unique challenges, as ETH encountered new all-time highs alongside some bearish trends influenced by various macroeconomic factors. As the new year 2026 unfolds, there are encouraging signs of recovery, although the current Ethereum price prediction for 2026 remains mixed.\nHowever, the past year has posed significant challenges that have raised important questions regarding Ethereum\u2019s crypto trajectory. There is cautious optimism about a potential bullish cycle for 2026, should ETH manage to diverge from last year\u2019s seasonal patterns.\nThis bullish optimism is due to the Ethereum network, which underwent two significant technical enhancements last year, known as Pectra and Fusaka, resulting in improved scalability and reduced transaction fees.\nNow, many are intrigued about where the ETH price could go next. This article covers Ethereum price prediction 2026-2030.\nEthereum Price Today\nTable of contents\nHow Was the ETH Price in 2025?\nIn 2025, ETH demonstrated resilience, avoiding a major crisis, although its performance paled in comparison to the standout year of 2022, where only seven months closed in the red. Despite the absence of catastrophic events or high-profile bankruptcies in the crypto space, ETH experienced a significant drop, even amid record wallet activity.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, following Trump\u2019s election win, ETH saw a remarkable rally of 74%, surging from $2,350 to over $4,100. However, the momentum faltered in Q1 2025 due to profit-taking in response to a series of macroeconomic developments. By April 2025, the price had plummeted nearly 66%, hitting a low of $1,345.\nThe landscape shifted with a surge in ETF demand from major players like BlackRock and an improving macroeconomic environment, which revitalized the market. This resurgence propelled ETH to an all-time high of $4,955, marking an impressive 254% increase.\nHowever, this bullish momentum proved difficult to sustain, and the price retraced to $2,750, reflecting a 44% downturn. Currently, conditions have lifted ETH back above the critical $3,000 mark. Maintaining this level is essential for a continued rally into 2026, and the outlook remains optimistic.\nEthereum Price Prediction 2026\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a substantial upward trend since 2020, showcasing impressive bullish momentum along its established trendline. After a series of market fluctuations, Ethereum has a trend of effectively eliminating weaker positions, allowing for a strong rally.\nContinuing this trend, there is potential for ETH to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $6,000 by 2026. This forecast is based on the assumption that it will maintain support around the $2,500 level, which has emerged as a critical trading range. If Ethereum can solidify its position within this range and attract sustained investor interest, the prospects for future gains look promising.\nEthereum price prediction 2027-2030\nEthereum Price Forecast 2027\nThe Ethereum 2027 forecast expects the ETH coin price to make a new all-time high at $21,213.24. However, a correction based on market shortcomings may drive the ETH crypto to $7,071.08, with an average of $14,142.16.\nETH Price Prediction 2028\nIn 2028, the chances of Ethereum dominating the crypto market rise as the ETH price potentially makes a new high at $31,819.86. On the other hand, the altcoin might fall to $10,606.62, making an average of $21,213.24.\nEthereum Price Forecast 2029\nApproaching its all-time high of $47,729.79 in 2029, the Ethereum price is expected to surpass the psychological barrier of $40,000. In case of a correction, $ETH may reach a low of $15,909.93, with an average price of $31,819.86.\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\nAs per our Eth"

                "body": "Gold 2026 Outlook: XAU/USD Technical Analysis\nMuch of the additional gold purchases we saw beyond those driven by macro factors (see our Gold 2026 Outlook fundamental analysis for more) were undoubtedly driven by speculative interest in 2025 with traders looking to take advantage of a strong bullish trend. Will that continue in 2026 remains to be seen, but the technical trend was unambiguously bullish approaching the end of 2025 and heading into 2026.\nGold 2026 outlook: Technical levels that matter\nWhile momentum indicators continued to signal \u2018overbought\u2019 as they have done throughout 2025, until such a time we see a bearish reversal, there is no point in entertaining the idea of shorting gold aggressively. Granted, counter-trend trades will present themselves here and there, but if those higher highs and higher lows are not violated, the path of least resistance will remain to the upside.\nWith gold breaking to above $4,500, clearing the old high at $4,381, we now have a short-term level to watch as potential support. This $4,381 level was the high made in October, before it finally gave way during the December rally. Below that, there are a few other short-term levels to watch too, including $4250, $4200 and $4100. But that $4K hurdle is the key support now and the line in the sand, as a break back below it could be significant for the gold 2026 outlook from a technical perspective. Below $4K, there is a trend line that comes in somewhere between this psychological hurdle and the next big level at $3500.\nIn terms of resistance, well there wasn\u2019t much with prices at record highs. Keep an eye on the next round handles such as $4,600, $4,700 and so on. If the rally can sustain itself above $4,500, or we go back above it after a major shakeout first, then that would likely trigger market speculation about gold potentially reaching for $5,000 next.\nThe bigger picture for gold 2026 outlook\nTaken together, the gold 2026 outlook is a balancing act. On one side sit geopolitical risks, central-bank demand and the ever-present possibility of market turbulence \u2014 all supportive of gold. On the other sit elevated global yields, the potential end of the monetary easing cycle, and the risk of China stepping back from adding to its reserves. Gold may well remain elevated, but sustaining further gains from here will require either a fresh geopolitical jolt or a clear dovish shift in global rate expectations \u2014 neither of which is guaranteed.\nSo, as we look ahead to 2026, the gold outlook is far more finely balanced than in 2025. The longer-term bullish case remains intact and there\u2019s still little incentive to be aggressively bearish, but the tailwinds that powered gold through 2025 may not blow as strongly. Central bank demand, the direction of global yields, and how much easing is truly left in the pipeline will matter more than ever. With geopolitical risks showing signs of stabilising and real yields remaining elevated, gold may need fresh catalysts to extend its rally. In short, the trend is still constructive, but after such an exceptional run, the margin for disappointment is growing and the risk of a corrective phase in 2026 should not be underestimated.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

The move is notable against a volatile backdrop for bitcoin itself, lifting the fund\u2019s assets under management to roughly $2.21 billion. The latest allocation equals about 1.49% of BITO\u2019s total AUM, a meaningful one-day shift that suggests investors are still willing to add futures-based exposure despite recent crypto price weakness.\nThe late-year inflow hints at a mix of dip-buying and strategic positioning: some investors may be rebalancing portfolios after bitcoin\u2019s pullback, while others could be using the futures ETF wrapper as a more regulated route into the asset class. With nearly one-and-a-half percent of AUM changing hands in a single session, BITO\u2019s year-end tape underscores how quickly sentiment in crypto-linked products can swing, even without spot ETF approvals driving the narrative.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $89,769.99, down about 26.17% over the past three months. Despite that sharp three-month retreat, short-term signals remain more cautious than outright bearish, with a 1-day technical stance of Hold. That combination of medium-term drawdown and neutral near-term momentum may be encouraging investors to average into positions through vehicles like BITO rather than chase momentum at higher levels.\nThe divergence between sustained ETF inflows and a bruised spot price will be closely watched in early 2026; a continuation could signal growing confidence that bitcoin\u2019s weakness is cyclical rather than structural.

Finviz\nThe move matters because IREN has become a fast-moving proxy for two themes that can swing sharply on sentiment: bitcoin mining and powering AI computing. Friday\u2019s bounce signaled renewed appetite for risk after a late-December slide in growth and speculative names.\nThe rally was not isolated. Larger listed bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) also ended sharply higher, pointing to a sector-wide bid rather than a single-stock catalyst.\nBitcoin was last near $90,000, leaving crypto-sensitive equities exposed to further swings in the token as the new trading week begins.\nIn broader markets, the Dow and S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as chipmakers led a rebound; the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 4%. Joe Mazzola, head of trading and derivatives strategy at Charles Schwab, described a \u201cbuy the dip, sell the rip\u201d mentality. Reuters\nIREN also disclosed a new securities registration on Friday. A filing showed it registered 17.5 million ordinary shares for future issuance under its 2025 Omnibus Incentive Plan, adding a fresh datapoint for traders watching potential dilution. Streetinsider\nThe filing said the registration \u201cdoes not constitute a current issuance\u201d of shares. Form S-8 is a standard SEC registration statement companies use to cover stock awards under employee benefit plans; shares are only issued if awards are granted and exercised or vested.\nIREN has drawn outsized attention over the past quarter as it pivots from bitcoin mining toward AI cloud and data center infrastructure. The company\u2019s profile was lifted in November after Microsoft signed a $9.7 billion, five-year contract with IREN tied to access to Nvidia chips, Reuters reported at the time. Reuters\nFor the latest session, IREN traded between $38.10 and $42.99, with volume above 30 million shares, reflecting heavy participation despite the holiday-thinned start to the year.\nTechnically, traders will be watching whether the stock can hold above Friday\u2019s lows near $38 and revisit the $43 area, which marked the session high. A break either way could set the tone for momentum flows when the market reopens on Monday.\nBefore the next session, macro risk is also back on the agenda. Reuters\u2019 weekly outlook flagged U.S. employment data due Jan. 9 and consumer price inflation data due Jan. 13 as potential catalysts for rate expectations and equity volatility. Reuters\nWith growth valuations still sensitive to the rate path, any repricing of Federal Reserve expectations can quickly spill into high-beta names like IREN. Traders will also be watching for the start of fourth-quarter earnings season and any fresh company updates or financing moves that could reset expectations for its AI buildout."

The steady demand has helped tilt near-term supply and demand dynamics in XRP\u2019s favor, even as broader crypto benchmarks remain rangebound.\nThe move also comes as traders reassess the regulatory backdrop after SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw\u2019s departure, which some market participants viewed as clearing the way for a more crypto-friendly policy stance.\nCrenshaw had been among the most vocal skeptics of crypto spot ETFs and had opposed the SEC dropping its appeal in the Ripple case, according to market commentary.\nSpeculation around upcoming legislation added to the momentum.

Together, the two networks offer a glimpse into how the industry\u2019s leading platforms are positioning themselves for the next wave of adoption.\nThis shift matters because deeper institutional adoption, better interoperability, and more real-world financial use cases could influence long-term demand, yield opportunities, and the durability of returns tied to the assets built on top of these networks.\nEthereum\u2019s 2026 push towards interoperability\nEthereum\u2019s momentum in 2025 has been driven in large part by growing institutional adoption, including from spot ETFs driving up to the emergence of digital asset treasuries (DATs). Mike Silagadze, the cofounder of ether.fi, one of the largest restaking networks, pointed to ongoing improvements at the protocol level as a key enabler, noting that the network is focused on \u201cmaking the Ethereum mainnet layer one more scalable,\u201d with transactions already \u201csuper cheap now and will continue to get better.\u201d\nHe added that progress on layer-two interoperability \u2014 \u201cmaking it easier to move assets across layer twos and Ethereum\u201d \u2014 has been \u201cexactly the right stuff to work on,\u201d alongside broader efforts to advocate for institutional adoption.\nThat push toward interoperability is also resonating with builders across the Ethereum ecosystem.

That\u2019s about to end.\u201d\nHe said recent advancements in interoperability technology are setting the stage for a major shift in Ethereum DeFi, predicting that \u201c2026 will be the year all of these siloed ecosystems come back together to create a lightning-fast, cost-efficient and truly interoperable experience for users and institutions alike.\u201d\nWhile ETFs have expanded access to ether, Silagadze said they fall short of exposing investors to the economic activity happening onchain.\n\u201cThe ETFs let you have access to the asset, but they don't really give you any exposure to DeFi or the earning opportunities,\u201d he said, arguing that DATs fill that gap. \u201cI think that's where the DATs come in\u2026 and I think it certainly had a positive impact on the price [of ETH], no question.\u201d\nETH fe"

                "body": "XRP\u2019s price surge over the last 24 hours has pushed its market capitalization past that of Binance-affiliated BNB, reclaiming its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.\nExcluding stablecoins, XRP now trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin holds the top spot with a market capitalization of $1.79 trillion, followed by Ethereum at $373 billion.\nThe price of XRP popped above the vaunted $2 milestone on Friday for the first time since mid-December, extending a strong start to 2026. XRP\u2019s meteoric price performance can be attributed to strong spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and the improving U.S. regulatory environment.\nXRP Back In The Top 4 After Flipping BNB\nXRP\u2019s market cap has climbed to the 3rd spot among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. XRP was changing hands at $2.01 as of publication time, up 5.6%, while Bitcoin traded just above $90,000, CoinGecko data shows.\nThe upsurge also comes as investors reevaluate the regulatory environment, as SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her skepticism of crypto, is set to depart the agency this week after serving a five-year tenure at the United States\u2019 main digital assets regulator\u2014 a major win for the crypto industry\u2019s bid to expand its influence on Capitol Hill.\nCrenshaw publicly denounced the SEC\u2019s settlement with Ripple after their protracted legal brawl, cautioning that it represented a retreat from meaningful crypto enforcement and left investors exposed.\nCrenshaw\u2019s exit stokes hopes that more digital asset-friendly regulations will take root in the US.\nSteady ETF inflows added to the momentum. According to data from SoSoValue, U.S.-listed spot XRP investment products pulled in $13.59 million on Jan. 2, bringing the total inflows since their debut in November to $1.18 billion and nd total assets under management to over $1.37 billion. The continued demand has helped shift supply and demand dynamics in favor of XRP bulls as confidence slowly rebuilds."

                "body": "Santiment kicked off the weekend with a quick snapshot of the coins getting the loudest chatter on social media, and it reads like a mash-up of old-school blue chips and the latest meme frenzy. On top of the list: PEPE, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solana, and Crypto.com\u2019s CRO, each one showing why people can\u2019t stop talking, buying, or arguing about them.\nMeme Mania vs. Institutional Flow\nPEPE stole the headlines in the way meme coins do: sudden spikes, wild intraday moves, big volume, and a whole lot of hype on Reddit, Telegram and X. Folks are calling it the new memecoin to watch, comparisons to SHIB, BONK, FLOKI and even DOGE are everywhere, and some traders are cheering bullish technicals and short squeezes while others warn it\u2019s riding the same unstable rocket that burned people before. It\u2019s messy, noisy and exciting, which is exactly what fuels a meme rally.\nBitcoin\u2019s conversations felt different: more news-driven and institutional. Between Bitfarms\u2019 sale of a Paraguayan mining site for up to $30 million, Tether quietly sitting on about $8.42 billion in BTC, and chatter about South Korea\u2019s exchanges and ETFs, there\u2019s plenty to talk about besides price charts. People on Twitter are debating what options expiries mean for volatility, tossing around bullish 2026 predictions, and watching ETF flows, including $348 million in outflows at the end of 2025, that still manage to flip sentiment in a hurry.\nEthereum\u2019s buzz was more workmanlike: talks about ETH hovering near $3,000, steady institutional inflows, and lots of on-chain activity, smart contracts, NFTs, Layer-2 rollouts and the plumbing that actually keeps apps running. The usual debates are back too: scaling, gas fees, staking, and governance headaches like the Parity bug and recovery proposals. For a lot of people, Ethereum isn\u2019t a meme; it\u2019s the rails for the ecosystem, which keeps conversation steady and practical.\nDogecoin showed up with familiar fanfare. Telegram channels recorded price pops and whale buys, Reddit lit up with threads about rallies, and Twitter amplified big-ticket purchases and bullish setups. Mentions of Elon Musk still pop up because with DOGE, the social-media angle never really left. It\u2019s a roller coaster that keeps drawing riders.\nSolana\u2019s story this weekend leaned on fundamentals and optimism. Users pointed to low fees, fast transactions, rising TVL and fresh developer activity, plus liquid staking and whale accumulation. Technicals and on-chain metrics are backing up the bullish takes, even as critics remind everyone of Solana\u2019s past outages and the tight competition among Layer-1s.\nCRO\u2019s conversation was the murkiest of the bunch. People debated token utility, staking perks and burn mechanics while also questioning trust and roadmap clarity. Some users suggested clever new use cases, like gaming integrations, while skeptics floated worries about centralization or whether CRO will ever convincingly prove its value. The tone was a mix of hope, critique and the kind of constructive suggestions you see in active ecosystems.\nPut it all together and it\u2019s clear why social media still matters to markets. Meme coins can ignite quick rallies and suck in huge volumes of attention, while Bitcoin and Ethereum conversations are often rooted in big-picture flows and tech developments. Projects tied to real ecosystems get graded on both narrative and utility, and tokens with mixed signals attract both believers and doubters.\nIf you\u2019re trading, this kind of social noise can point to short-term liquidity and volatility, useful if you thrive on fast moves, risky if you don\u2019t. If you\u2019re investing longer term, it\u2019s a reminder to separate headline hype from real, lasting progress. Either way, Santiment\u2019s list is a handy map of where attention is concentrated this weekend, and attention, as ever, is a powerful market force."

For Solana, the focus was on stress-testing the network under real demand and hardening its infrastructure, setting the stage for deeper financial use cases in the year ahead. Together, the two networks offer a glimpse into how the industry\u2019s leading platforms are positioning themselves for the next wave of adoption.\nThis shift matters because deeper institutional adoption, better interoperability, and more real-world financial use cases could influence long-term demand, yield opportunities, and the durability of returns tied to the assets built on top of these networks.\nEthereum\u2019s 2026 push towards interoperability\nEthereum\u2019s momentum in 2025 has been driven in large part by growing institutional adoption, including from spot ETFs driving up to the emergence of digital asset treasuries (DATs). Mike Silagadze, the cofounder of ether.fi, one of the largest restaking networks, pointed to ongoing improvements at the protocol level as a key enabler, noting that the network is focused on \u201cmaking the Ethereum mainnet layer one more scalable,\u201d with transactions already \u201csuper cheap now and will continue to get better.\u201d\nHe added that progress on layer-two interoperability \u2014 \u201cmaking it easier to move assets across layer twos and Ethereum\u201d \u2014 has been \u201cexactly the right stuff to work on,\u201d alongside broader efforts to advocate for institutional adoption.\nThat push toward interoperability is also resonating with builders across the Ethereum ecosystem. Alex Cutler, CEO of Dromos Labs, the team behind Base\u2019s largest decentralized exchange, Aerodrome, said the next wave of Ethereum upgrades marks a turning point after years of fragmentation.\n\u201cIn a word: unification,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent 5+ years making things cheaper and faster, but in doing fractured UX and fragmented liquidity. That\u2019s about to end.\u201d\nHe said recent advancements in interoperability technology are setting the stage for a major shift in Ethereum DeFi, predicting that \u201c2026 will be the year all of these siloed ecosystems come back together to create a lightning-fast, cost-efficient and truly interoperable experience for users and institutions alike.\u201d\nWhile ETFs have expanded access to ether, Silagadze said they fall short of exposing investors to the economic activity happening onchain.\n\u201cThe ETFs let you have access to the asset, but they don't really give you any exposure to DeFi or the earning opportunities,\u201d he said, arguing that DATs fill that gap. \u201cI think that's where the DATs come in\u2026 and I think it certainly had a positive impact on the price [of ETH], no question.\u201d\nETH fe"

                "body": "Introduction: A Sleeping Giant in Crypto\nImagine a cryptocurrency that drops in price but hides massive potential for a <1,000% surge>. That\u2019s Solana (SOL) right now. Despite a rough patch, with its price hovering around $140 after a 30% dip this year, Solana has shown it can deliver explosive growth. In 2023, it rocketed nearly 1,000%, turning heads worldwide. Could lightning strike twice? Many experts think yes, thanks to its speed, low costs, and booming ecosystem.\nSolana launched in 2020 as a high-speed alternative to slower blockchains. Today, its market cap sits at about $75 billion, dwarfed by Ethereum\u2019s $375 billion. But what if Solana flips the script? A move to Ethereum\u2019s size could mean a 5x jump. Even bigger dreams point to $1 trillion status, rivaling Bitcoin. Let\u2019s dive into why\nSolana\u2019s Tech Edge: Faster and Cheaper Than Ethereum\nSolana earned its \u201cEthereum killer\u201d nickname for good reason. Ethereum handles about 15-30 transactions per second (TPS). Solana? Up to 65,000 TPS in real-world use, with tests hitting 1 million TPS. This comes from its unique Proof of History (PoH) combined with Proof of Stake (PoS).\n- Proof of History: Timestamps transactions without heavy computation, speeding things up.\n- Low Fees: Pennies per transaction vs. Ethereum\u2019s gas fees that spike during busy times.\n- Scalability: Grows without sharding or layer-2 fixes Ethereum needs.\nDevelopers love it. Apps on Solana run smoother, attracting DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and games. Ethereum\u2019s upgrades like Dencun help, but Solana stays ahead in raw speed.\nRecord Revenue: $3 Billion and Counting\nSolana\u2019s blockchain isn\u2019t just fast\u2014it\u2019s profitable. Over the last 12 months, its ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue from fees and activity. That\u2019s huge for a chain just four years old. Compare to Ethereum at a similar stage: Solana laps it.\nThis cash comes from:\n- DeFi protocols like Jupiter and Raydium, with billions in total value locked (TVL).\n- NFT boom on Magic Eden and Tensor.\n- Memecoin frenzy via platforms like Pump.fun, driving viral trading.\nIf revenue keeps climbing into 2026, price targets will soar. Strong fundamentals like this fuel those <1,000% explosion> dreams.\nPast Performance: The 2023 Miracle Run\nForget the current dip\u2014Solana\u2019s history screams potential. From launch to now:\nAt $140 today, far from its $294 peak, Solana trades at a discount. High-market-cap coins rarely 10x, but Solana did it before. With better tech and revenue, a repeat isn\u2019t crazy.\nBeating Ethereum: The Path to $375 Billion Market Cap\nEthereum dominates smart contracts at $375 billion. Solana trails at $75 billion but closes the gap. If Solana captures even half Ethereum\u2019s users:\n- Market cap could hit $200+ billion (3x from now).\n- Full takeover? 5x to $375 billion.\n- 1,000% surge? Pushes toward $1 trillion, elite territory with Bitcoin.\nTrends favor Solana. Ethereum\u2019s high fees push users away during bull runs. Solana\u2019s ecosystem TVL nears $10 billion, with daily active users rivaling Ethereum. Projects migrate daily.\nHot Ecosystem Plays: Memecoins, DeFi, and Beyond\nSolana thrives on real activity:\nMemecoins: Platforms like Pump.fun launched thousands of tokens, generating millions in fees. Hits like BONK and WIF started here.\nDeFi: Kamino, Drift\u2014lending, trading, yields beat Ethereum rivals.\nGaming & NFTs: Star Atlas, Aurory build Web3 games. NFT volume exploded post-FTX crash.\nUpcoming Firedancer upgrade could boost TPS further, drawing institutions.\nRisks to Watch Before Betting Big\nNo <1,000% moonshot> is risk-free. Solana faced outages in 2021-2022 from spam attacks. Fixes like QUIC and stake-weighted QoS improved stability, but critics linger.\n- Competition: Sui, Aptos, even Ethereum L2s challenge speed claims.\n- Regulation: Crypto crackdowns could hit all altcoins.\n- Market Volatility: Bitcoin halving or recession sways everything.\nStill, Solana\u2019s team iterates fast. Revenue proves demand.\nConclusion: Is Solana Your Next 1,000% Win"

This isn\u2019t just another market cycle\u2014it\u2019s a potential $trillion reboot of how we think about finance, driven by cutting-edge technology and strategic market positioning. As of January 4, 2026, Ethereum is trading at $3,125.61, while Solana sits at $133.28, reflecting incremental daily gains of 0.12% and 0.84%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. What does this mean for the future? For investors, tech enthusiasts, and everyday users, this convergence could unlock unprecedented opportunities\u2014or risks\u2014if you\u2019re not paying attention. Curious about where this is headed? Check the AI analysis to see what data-driven insights reveal about this transformative moment.\nThe DeFi landscape in early 2026 is buzzing with potential, and Ethereum and Solana are at the heart of this revolution. Ethereum continues to dominate with an 11.88% share of the total crypto market, as reported by CoinGecko, cementing its role as the backbone of DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s rapid ascent, fueled by its high-performance architecture, positions it as a serious contender, with its price reflecting steady growth.\nBut there\u2019s more to the story. The broader market sentiment, as captured by the Fear & Greed Index from Alternative.me, currently sits at a chilling 25, signaling extreme fear. This environment, while daunting, often precedes significant buying opportunities for savvy investors. Both platforms are leveraging technological advancements\u2014Ethereum with its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) transition and Solana with its Proof-of-History mechanism\u2014to address scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for a DeFi resurgence.\nRecent developments show Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum gaining traction, slashing transaction costs. Solana, on the other hand, is making waves with its lightning-fast transactions, appealing to high-frequency DeFi applications. Could this be the tipping point for mainstream adoption? The data suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of something big.\nFor investors, the rise of Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi space is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the potential for explosive growth is undeniable\u2014Ethereum\u2019s deflationary tokenomics post-PoS could drive price appreciation, while Solana\u2019s low-cost, high-speed network attracts a flood of new projects. On the other hand, volatility remains a constant companion in crypto, amplified by regulatory uncertainties and technical hiccups.\nSo, what\u2019s the play? Diversification across both platforms could mitigate risks while capitalizing on their unique strengths. Ethereum offers stability and a mature ecosystem, ideal for long-term holdings. Solana, with its growth trajectory, might appeal to those chasing higher risk-reward ratios. Want to dive deeper into the numbers? Get AI analysis for Ethereum to uncover actionable insights tailored to your portfolio.\nThe key takeaway: timing is everything. With market sentiment leaning toward fear, now could be the moment to position yourself before the next bull run. But tread carefully\u2014due diligence and risk management are non-negotiable in this fast-moving arena.\nTo grasp why Ethereum and Solana are stealing the spotlight in 2026, we need to rewind a bit. DeFi exploded onto the scene in 2020, promising a world where financial services\u2014lending, borrowing, trading\u2014could operate without intermediaries. Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, became the de facto platform, hosting over 70% of DeFi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) at i"

The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 6,858.47, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% to 23,235.63, leaving all three major benchmarks down on the week. AP News\nThe early-year tone matters because January often sets the first real test of risk appetite after thin holiday trading. Investors are also watching whether leadership broadens beyond mega-cap technology after a 2025 rally that left valuations sensitive to any stumble in growth or earnings expectations.\nFriday\u2019s move also showed how quickly the Dow can swing on a small group of names because it is price-weighted \u2014 higher-priced shares move the index more than lower-priced ones, regardless of company size. MarketWatch said Caterpillar rose $24.69 and Boeing gained $7.99, together accounting for about 201 points of the Dow\u2019s rise, while Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth and Chevron also boosted the index. MarketWatch\nChip stocks added to the risk-on bid, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 4%, Bloomberg reported. The bounce in semiconductors helped cushion broader indexes even as investors stayed selective in pricey technology names. Bloomberg\nTesla\u2019s weaker delivery trend kept pressure on the tech complex. The electric-vehicle maker said annual deliveries fell about 8.6% in 2025 to 1.64 million, and Reuters reported China\u2019s BYD overtook it as the world\u2019s top EV seller; Tesla shares were down about 2% in afternoon trading. Reuters\nThat split \u2014 cyclicals and industrials up, parts of megacap tech still heavy \u2014 is what traders are watching for in early 2026. It can leave the Dow looking stronger than the broader market on days when a handful of industrial bellwethers take the lead.\nPolicy headlines are another moving part for risk sentiment. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation delaying increased tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities for a year, keeping a 25% tariff in place while postponing higher rates that were set to take effect on Jan. 1, the Associated Press reported. AP News\nEven when tariff changes do not hit Dow components directly, they can influence expectations for prices, consumer demand and corporate margins. Those are the same channels investors will be tracking as they reassess inflation risks and the path for interest rates.\nRate expectations remain central, particularly after the Federal Reserve cut rates at each of its last three meetings of 2025, Reuters reported. Fed funds futures \u2014 derivatives that reflect where traders see the policy rate heading \u2014 suggested little chance of a cut at the late-January meeting but nearly a 50% chance of a quarter-point reduction in March, and Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said, \u201cThe market is looking for direction.\u201d Reuters\nBefore the next session on Monday, investors will position for a key run of U.S. data that can reprice those rate bets quickly. The Labor Department\u2019s December employment report is scheduled for Jan. 9 at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the consumer price index on Jan. 13 at 8:30 a.m. ET. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nEarnings season is the other immediate catalyst for the Dow, which includes several major financials.

December\u2019s final sessions pulled back even as 2025 ended strong, according to Australian coverage of a record year\u2019s close source. That set the stage for Dow Jones today to lead while tech reset. We are watching whether early strength broadens or fades into the first payrolls and Fedspeak of 2026.\nTech stocks lag despite strong 2025 run\nAfter a powerful 2025, investors took profits in mega caps such as AAPL and MSFT. Position sizes were large after last year\u2019s gains, so even small trims weighed on benchmarks. Dow Jones today benefited as flows shifted toward value and defensives. For portfolios, rebalancing reduces single-name concentration risk and can free cash for earnings-season opportunities in January.\nHigh-growth names remain sensitive to real yields and valuation checks. After 2025\u2019s run, the bar for tech guidance is high, and any cautious tone can trigger pullbacks. News flow also noted Wall Street ended 2025 with solid annual gains despite a soft December, framing today\u2019s rotation as healthy source. If earnings confirm cash flow strength, leadership can broaden. Until then, tech stocks lag when rates firm.\nWhat rotation means for US indices this week\nA value tilt tends to aid the Dow, while a tech pause pressures the Nasdaq 100. The S&P 500 sits between both styles. If cyclicals keep the bid, ^DJI could outpace ^NDX, with ^GSPC mixed. That is why Dow Jones today outperformed as the week began. Watch sector breadth, advance-decline lines, and guidance from early reporters for confirmation.\nWe expect flows into banks, energy, and industrials if the tone stays risk-selective. That can pull demand from broad tech funds near earnings. For traders, keep an eye on liquidity around US open and into the close. For investors, staged adds make sense, using pullbacks to build value exposure while keeping some growth optionality if sentiment inverts quickly.\nHow Australian investors can position\nA stronger Australian dollar can reduce unhedged returns from US assets, while a softer AUD boosts them. With Dow Jones today firm and tech softer, consider whether USD exposure is hedged. Long-term investors can mix hedged and unhedged allocations to balance currency swings. Near-term, rotation toward cash-generative sectors suits investors seeking steadier AUD-adjusted outcomes.\nKeep entries staggered and use ranges instead of single price targets. Pair value adds with selective quality growth. Rebalance to reduce concentration in the largest names. Set clear review points around earnings and macro prints. If the Santa Claus rally stays absent, defense first, offense second. Let Dow Jones today guide watchlists, but let risk rules guide decisions.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe first session of 2026 shows a clear tone: Dow Jones today closed higher while tech cooled, and the missing Santa Claus rally hints at a more selective risk backdrop. For index watcher"

                "body": "As stated by CNN\nThe U.S. stock market recorded a rare phenomenon: three straight years of double-digit gains. By the end of 2025 this had happened only six times since the 1940s, underscoring an exceptional streak of profitability.\nThe S&P 500 rose 16.39% in 2025, after gains of 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. This rise came despite concerns about tariffs, geopolitical tensions, doubts about a market bubble, and the longest-ever government shutdown.\nA three-year streak of double-digit gains is a rare phenomenon. Until this year the index had experienced it five times, and now it is the sixth occurrence, with two of the previous streaks ending in four years of growth, and one appearing in the 1990s as a five-year stretch, according to Sam Stovall, CFRA Research\u2019s chief investment strategist.\nIn 2025 the market was supported by solid corporate earnings, enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, and optimism about lower rates from the Federal Reserve.\nTowards year-end, equities retraced somewhat: Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell for four days in a row, but overall the year proved favorable for the stock market.\n\u201cStock markets finish the year on a high note, the S&P 500 aiming for a third straight year of double-digit gains, fueled by AI momentum and a robust economy that has weathered financial and political headwinds.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 began the year after the strongest two-year run of gains, the most powerful since the late 1990s. As Donald Trump prepared to take office, Wall Street was cautiously optimistic about further profits.\nAt the start of the year, markets plunged after the Chinese tech startup DeepSeek unveiled an AI-powered chatbot, prompting concerns in the financial community about overfunding AI companies. Yet later, investors returned to betting on the U.S. lead in the race for AI technologies \u2013 a theme that supported markets despite fears of a bubble in the market.\nIn the spring there was historic volatility when Trump introduced the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, slapped on imports from various countries around the world.\nNevertheless, equities sharply recovered after Trump backed away from the harshest tariff threats, and by the end of June the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded their first all-time highs since February. Since then, markets have kept rising thanks to strong corporate earnings and expectations for a Fed rate cut, which boosted the appeal of stocks relative to bonds.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about 12.97% for the year. The index fluctuated: around 43,000 at the start of the year, below 37,000 in April, then recovered after postponement of most tariffs. In August the Dow reached a new high above 45,000, later surpassing 46,000, 47,000 and 48,000 in short intervals.\nAI became the story of the year, and as a result the Nasdaq Composite rose 20.36%, becoming the best-performing of the three major indices over the last three years. Technologies and AI supported U.S. market gains since October 2022, when OpenAI first unveiled ChatGPT, marking the start of a bull market for AI.\nThis year saw notable volatility: the VIX volatility index rose in April to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic, and in June spiked due to tensions between Israel and Iran, but volatility later stabilized.\nThe government sector \u2013 the debt market \u2013 remained relatively stable after the spring turbulence related to tariffs. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries at the start of the year was 4.57% and by year-end fell to 4.17%, partly supporting a decline in housing demand in 2025.\nBond yields and prices moved contrary to investors\u2019 expectations: a prolonged rally in bonds led to lower yields and signaled expectations of looser monetary policy and a softer labor market.\nAfter this, the 30-year Treasury yield rose to 4.84% amid concerns about the persistence of inflation.\nIn the U.S. dollar, last year was marked by notable swings: the dollar index was weaker against six major currencies, down about 9.4% for the year \u2013 t"

                "url": "https://daxstreet.com/news/341110/porsches-vision-for-a-world-beyond-paint-cars-that-change-color-on-demand/",
                "body": "Porsche\u2019s personalization programs are already among the most extensive in the automotive world, yet the German marque appears far from satisfied. Rather than stopping at bespoke paint finishes, Porsche is now exploring a future where traditional paint itself could become obsolete.\nA newly uncovered patent suggests the company is investigating color-shifting bodywork that can dynamically change appearance, potentially taking vehicle customization to an entirely new level.\nAt present, Porsche customers looking for individuality can turn to the brand\u2019s Sonderwunsch division, which offers two highly exclusive routes for exterior color personalization. Paint to Sample (PTS) gives buyers access to more than 220 carefully curated shades drawn from Porsche\u2019s historical palette and special collections.\nFor those who want something even more personal, Paint to Sample Plus (PTS+) allows customers to submit their own reference item, anything from a piece of clothing to a cosmetic product, with prices typically exceeding $30,000. Even by ultra-luxury standards, this is personalization taken seriously.\nStill, Porsche seems to believe that choosing a single, perfect color may no longer be enough. According to a recently published patent, the automaker is investigating a system that would allow a car\u2019s exterior color to change automatically, adapting to its surroundings or even to the driver\u2019s outfit.\nRather than committing to one shade, the vehicle itself would decide, or be instructed, what color to wear at any given moment. The patent was filed with the German office of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on September 25, 2024, and published on December 4, 2025.\nThe accompanying illustrations depict what appears to be a Porsche 911 equipped with a sophisticated color-changing system. Central to the concept is a camera-based setup capable of analyzing visual input, such as the clothing worn by the driver.\nWhile the patent shows the recording device inside the vehicle, the technology could theoretically work with external cameras or even a smartphone.\nAt the core of the system is what Porsche calls an \u201cactively controllable, optically changeable coating.\u201d This advanced surface treatment would be applied to parts of the vehicle\u2019s body and could alter its appearance in real time.\nThe coating relies on electrically stimulated pigment particles arranged in separate red, green, and blue layers. By activating these layers in varying combinations, the system could reproduce a wide range of colors, effectively turning the car\u2019s exterior into a responsive display capable of matching almost any visual reference.\nAs with many patent filings, there is no confirmation that this technology will ever reach production, nor is there a timeline if it does. However, should Porsche decide to commercialize such a system, it could fundamentally change how owners think about automotive identity, moving beyond static paint toward something far more fluid and expressive.\nNaturally, several practical challenges would need to be addressed before such technology could be offered to customers.\nQuestions around durability, long-term maintenance, repair complexity, and cost remain unanswered, as does whether the system would cover the entire body or only select panels. These considerations will likely determine whether the idea remains experimental or evolves into a real-world option.\nPorsche is not alone in exploring this futuristic territory. BMW has already showcased its own color-changing technology using E Ink, with plans to introduce it on production vehicles by 2027.\nThe German rival demonstrated the concept through an i5 art car, using electricity to animate the exterior surface and create dynamic, customizable visuals. Together, these developments suggest that the era of fixed automotive paint may be closer to its end than many enthusiasts ever imagined.\nAlso Read: Top 10 of the Toughest Engines Ever Installed in Muscle Cars"

                "body": "Pulling back 12% this week, Healthcare Services Group's NASDAQ:HCSG) one-year decline in earnings may be coming into investors focus\nHealthcare Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCSG) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 12% in the last week. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been pleasing. To wit, it had solidly beat the market, up 48%.\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's one-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring the last year, Healthcare Services Group actually saw its earnings per share drop 21%.\nGiven the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.\nWe think that the revenue growth of 6.3% could have some investors interested. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nIf you are thinking of buying or selling Healthcare Services Group stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Healthcare Services Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 48% in the last twelve months. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 7% per year over five years. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. Before spending more time on Healthcare Services Group it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "^DJI Today, January 03: Dow Opens 2026 Higher as Semis Rally, Nasdaq Slips\nDow Jones today opened 2026 on a positive note as a chip-led rebound lifted blue chips while parts of Big Tech weighed on the Nasdaq. For Canadian investors, the split start highlights AI momentum into CES week and a data-heavy January for the Fed. We track ^DJI levels, what moved the S&P 500, and why Nasdaq today lagged. Here is what matters for positioning in RRSPs and TFSAs.\nWall Street starts 2026 with a mixed tone\nA fresh bid for chip names led early gains, helping the Dow Jones today open higher as traders leaned into the AI buildout theme ahead of CES. Strength in semiconductors offset softness in some mega-cap software and services. Live market coverage pointed to chips as the early leadership group, supporting a modest rise in the S&P 500 as breadth improved in cyclicals. See the recap on Yahoo Finance.\nDespite chip strength, Nasdaq today edged lower as select platform and cloud names faced early selling. Canadian investors saw a familiar pattern from late 2025: cyclicals firm, while a few crowded tech leaders cool. That left the three majors split at the open, with the S&P 500 near flat and the Dow up. Coverage noted the pressure on growth tech in a choppy start source.\nLevels and momentum to watch on the Dow\nTraders tracking the Dow Jones today are watching nearby reference points: the 50-day average sits near 47,547 and the 200-day near 44,510. Recent bands suggest a range between roughly 47,565 and 48,862, with the middle band around 48,214. Average true range is near 431 points, implying typical daily swings of about 0.9%. These levels frame risk and reward into early 2026.\nMomentum reads stay constructive but not euphoric. RSI is around 55, the MACD histogram is slightly negative, and ADX near 18 signals no strong trend. Money Flow Index is about 61, showing steady buying interest without overbought stress. For the Dow Jones today, that mix supports a buy-the-dip mindset, but patience matters if price stalls near upper bands.\nWhat it means for Canadian investors\nA stronger Dow Jones today often boosts risk appetite, which can spill over to TSX cyclicals like industrials, rails, and materials. AI server builds aid North American supply chains, from components to assembly. With the loonie sensitive to commodities and yields, watch USD/CAD on big Fed headlines. Hedged and unhedged U.S. ETFs will behave differently if currency swings widen.\nWe suggest a simple checklist: confirm U.S. equity weights versus plan targets, set alerts around 50-day and 200-day levels, and review whether you prefer hedged exposure. If Nasdaq today stays soft while chips lead, consider balancing growth with quality cyclicals. Keep dry powder for pullbacks and avoid chasing gaps. Revisit positions after key January data and the Fed.\nCatalysts ahead: CES and the Fed\nCES headlines can sway sentiment if chipmakers and OEMs detail stronger order books, supply timelines, or new GPU roadmaps. The Dow Jones today is leaning on the AI hardware cycle, so guidance on datacenter spending and edge devices matters. We will watch commentary on inventory, lead times, and capex signals from suppliers and buyers across the ecosystem.\nThe January Fed meeting, plus payrolls and CPI, will shape rates and multiples for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq today. If yields ease on cooler data, duration-heavy tech could rebound. If inflation re-accelerates, value and cash-flow names may lead. For Canadians, currency and U.S. rate differentials will be just as important as index direction.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe split open shows a simple theme: chips firm, mega-cap software mixed, and cyclicals steady. For portfolios, we would map entries near the 50-day average and trim into strength near upper bands. Keep an eye on CES guidance to validate the AI buildout, and let January data drive risk levels. If the Dow Jones today holds gains while Nasdaq stabilizes, breadth could improve. For Canadians, align U.S. exp"

                "body": "LKQ Corporation's (NASDAQ:LKQ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 11x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 20x and even P/E's above 34x are quite common. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nLKQ could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It seems that many are expecting the uninspiring earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.\nLKQ's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.\nTaking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any earnings per share growth to speak of for the company over the past year. The lack of growth did nothing to help the company's aggregate three-year performance, which is an unsavory 35% drop in EPS. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.6% during the coming year according to the eight analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 16% growth forecast for the broader market.\nWith this information, we can see why LKQ is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.\nWhat We Can Learn From LKQ's P/E?\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\nWe've established that LKQ maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\nBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for LKQ that you should be aware of.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if LKQ might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

Leetsdale Drive and S. Forest Street.\n\u201cThis fire ran freely from one end of this building to the (other),\" he said. \"It\u2019s a complete city block and it is on fire.\u201d\nDenver7's news helicopter flew over the scene on Friday night. Below is a sped-up timelapse of what we saw.\nHe said firefighters arrived at the scene to find the west end of a three-story apartment complex, which was under construction, fully engulfed in flames. The fire continued to push its way eastward through the building as firefighters set up to control it.\n\u201cThere was a little bit of wind when this fire first came in,\" Murphy said. \"A fire of this size actually generates kind of its own mini wind and starts pushing those embers out. When I arrived, those embers completely covered my car. That has since died down. That was when the fire was at its peak.\u201d\nInitially, authorities said no injuries were reported but the Denver Fire Department later posted on social media that one firefighter had been hurt and was transported to Denver Health. There were no other reported injuries, but Murphy said firefighters have not been able to safely enter the building and confirm nobody was inside. A chainlink fence was around the building to keep anybody outside of construction crews from going onto the site, Murphy said.\nThe Denver Police Department issued evacuations for residents behind the apartments due to the heat from the fire. As of 9:30 p.m., that is still in place, but Murphy said the fire department is no longer worried about the fire moving outside the burned structure. He said residents should be able to return home Friday evening.\nThere was \"a lot of exposure\" to neighboring buildings at the fire's peak, he said.\n\u201cThe damage is massive,\" he said of the construction site. \"I am not a building engineer, but there is a lot of fire and it is running completely through that building. As you can see, we have water pouring in from every angle that we can, trying to knock that fire down. There is a lot of damage.\u201d\nHe said the apartment complex did not have any drywall to slow the fire's progress, and was not yet outfitted with a sprinkler system.\nWitnesses captured the below videos of Friday evening's fire.\nThe fire was the biggest he has seen in Denver in a long time, he said.\n\u201cThis has really reached the level of about a five-alarm fire, which is huge for Denver,\" he explained.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation. Fire investigators are at the scene.\nLeetsdale Drive is closed in both directions, according to the Denver Police Department. Murphy said the road closures will likely stay in place through the night because deep-seeded fires are still burning in the apartment units.\nAs of 9:30 p.m., he said about 70% of the fire has been knocked down.\nDenver7's Claire Lavezzorio went to the scene and spoke with families in the neighborhood, who said power was turned off and firefighters knocked on their doors telling them to evacuate.\nResident Sean Horan said he walked out of his neighbors' house to see a small orange glow. Just a few minutes later, he said he saw flames that he estimated were 150 feet tall when compared to trees near the burning structure.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re not sure if we can even get back to our houses,\" added neighbor Michael Weiss. \"The whole street is barricaded off... It\u2019s really, really scary.\u201d\nHoran said a large apartment complex was under construction in the area, and he suspected that was what had caught fire.\nHe said it did not look like it had spread to any trees in the area.\n\u201cWaiting out here, looking at this, is pretty depressing,\" We"

The exchange is closed Jan. 1-3 and reopens on Monday, Jan. 5. Japan Exchange Group\nThat pause leaves investors anchored to the last Tokyo close: the Nikkei 225 ended at 50,339.48, down 0.37%, while the broader Topix finished at 3,408.97, down 0.51%, according to LSEG data carried by Reuters.

A weaker yen makes Japanese products less expensive overseas and improves repatriated revenues.\nShares in Sony Corp surged 2.82 per cent, construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd gained 2.18 per cent, Panasonic Corp jumped 1.58\nper cent and Ricoh Co was up 0.55 per cent.\nThe Bank of Japan decided Friday to refrain from additional monetary easing despite growing political pressure for it to help prop up the world's third-largest economy.\nThe bank said in mid-September it would expand an asset-purchase programme to about 80 trillion yen (1.02 trillion dollars) from 70\ntrillion yen.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent Thursday in reaction to positive US employment data and a statement by the European Central Bank that it stands ready to buy the government bonds of struggling eurozone counties.\nOn currency markets at 3 pm (08:00 SA time) in Tokyo, the dollar traded at 78.39-45 yen, down from Thursday's 5 pm quote of 78.60-61 yen.\nThe euro was quoted at 101.97-98 yen, up from 101.76-78 yen late Thursday, and at 1.3005-3007 dollars, up from 1.2947-2948 dollars. - Sapa-dpa"
