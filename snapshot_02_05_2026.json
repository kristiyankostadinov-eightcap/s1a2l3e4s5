It\u2019s a call to pay attention.\nWhen a 14-year trend is tested, markets are signaling a possible shift in regime \u2014 not tomorrow, but over time.\nWatch this 7-minute Market on Close segment to see John\u2019s chart breakdown:\n- Watch the full episode right here\n- Sign up for notifications to be alerted ahead of the next livestream\nOn the date of publication, Barchart Insights did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

                "body": "Gold and silver prices dropped sharply on Thursday amid a stronger dollar, which hovered near a two-week high, and growing indications that U.S.-China trade tensions may be easing, which reduced demand for safe-haven assets.\nAs of 5:06 GMT, spot gold fell 1.11 percent to $4,870.02 an ounce, pulling back after touching a near one-week high earlier in the session. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures for April delivery slid 1.34 percent to $4,884.50 an ounce.\nSpot silver also plummeted 9.86 percent to $76.35 an ounce after reaching a record high of $121.64 last week.\nUAE gold prices slide AED7.5\nIn the UAE, gold rates posted notable declines, with 24-carat gold falling AED7.5 to AED586 and 22-carat gold losing AED6.75 to AED542.75.\nAdditionally, 21-carat gold dipped AED6.75 to AED520.25, and 18-carat gold lost AED5.75 to reach AED446.\nMeanwhile, 14-carat gold fell AED4.5 to AED347.75.\nU.S. dollar rises to near two-week high\nGold prices fell as the U.S. dollar rose, supported by the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Chair of the Federal Reserve. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Warsh has sparked speculation that the central bank could adopt a less dovish stance than previously anticipated, lending further support to the U.S. dollar.\nThe dollar index climbed to a near two-week high on Thursday, rising 0.17 percent to 97.78, which raises the cost of dollar-denominated gold for buyers using other currencies.\nThe stronger dollar caused a broader selloff across most asset classes, including precious metals, cryptocurrencies and regional equities. Asian stocks slipped in line with their U.S. counterparts as worries over the surging costs of AI investment continued to weigh on the technology sector.\n\u201cWith the blink of an eye, volatility in the precious metals returns with silver falling 16 percent in quick time. It is common after a period of extreme volatility to experience a sequence of volatility aftershocks,\u201d said Tony Scaymore, Analyst at IG.\n\u201cAfter the 20 percent plunge from $5,600, gold hit $4,400 before rebounding to $5,065. Extreme volatility like this typically brings aftershocks, and more turbulence is expected in the short term,\u201d he added.\nGeopolitical risks ease as Iran and U.S. confirm talks\nOn the geopolitical front, Iran and the United States are set to hold talks in Oman on Friday, officials from both sides said. Meanwhile, China may increase purchases of U.S.-grown soybeans, President Donald Trump said, following what he described as \u201cvery positive\u201d talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, a state-backed industry association reported a decline in China\u2019s gold consumption in 2025, adding to the sharp decline in prices. Gold demand fell 3.57 percent year-on-year to 950.096 metric tons, while output from domestically sourced raw materials rose 1.09 percent to 381.339 metric tons, the association said on Thursday.\nOther precious metals\nAs gold and silver prices declined sharply on Thursday, the broader precious metals market declined. Spot platinum plunged 7.55 percent to $2,058.83 an ounce after reaching a record high of $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium fell 3.75 percent to $1,707.88 an ounce."

Historically, it trails other investment options, like stocks. From 1921 onward, silver has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 96%. That means an equal sum invested in silver and stocks back then would now be worth 96% less in silver holdings than stocks.\nInstead, silver is prized for its stability and its power to hedge against inflation. Often dubbed a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it tends to sustain purchasing power when inflation climbs.\nCompared with gold, silver prices generally swing more sharply due to industrial demand\u2014solar equipment, healthcare devices, and more\u2014whereas gold is almost purely a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\n\u201cSpot silver\u201d refers to the live market rate at which silver can be bought or sold instantly. That said, real-world buyers usually pay a premium over spot for markups, shipping, insurance, and other fees.\nThe spot price serves as a gauge of immediate market demand: a higher spot price means stronger buying interest.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\nThe term \u201cprice spread\u201d describes the difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices for silver. Here\u2019s how those terms are defined.\n- Ask price: the cost to purchase silver.\n- Bid price: the amount you receive when you sell silver.\nA narrower spread indicates high demand.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver exposure can be achieved through physical ownership or via silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs let you own a stake in a fund that holds silver, sparing you storage and insurance responsibilities.\nKey silver investment options include:\n- Bullion bars and rounds. These are sold by weight and purity\n- Government-minted silver coins. Iconic examples include American Silver Eagles and Canada\u2019s Silver Maple Leafs, which often trade at premiums for their rarity and backing.\n- Silver jewelry. Custom pieces that fetch prices above equal-purity bullion.\n- Silver mining equities. Stocks in companies extracting silver, offering a sort of indirect investment in silver.\nOn exchanges, bullion and coins must meet a minimum 99.9% purity. Lower-purity silver generally falls into collectible or industrial categories. Our guide to the best silver IRA companies provide more information on how to shrewdly invest in silver (and other precious metals).\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver has surged more than 150% over the past year, hitting its highest levels in over a decade.\nDeciding whether to invest now depends on your unique attitude toward the market. If inflation is top of mind, adding precious metals can be prudent. Or, if you foresee rising industrial applications\u2014such as electronics\u2014demand could potentially push prices even higher.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:30 a.m. ET today\nGold remains the benchmark metal, while platinum and palladium exhibit volatility patterns similar to silver due to smaller market caps. Gold\u2019s larger market makes it comparatively stable.\nThe takeaway\nWith economic volatility persistent in the current market, precious metals deserve at least a quick look. Silver\u2019s recent performance has outshined gold\u2019s, and many experts forecast "

The contracts with June expiry also fell around 3 percent.\nSilver futures with March expiry dropped 6 percent to Rs 2,52,719 per kilogram. The contracts with May expiry also fell 6 percent.\nGold and silver ETFs crash:\nMirroring the sharp fall in precious metals, gold and silver ETFs dropped in trade. Kotak Silver ETF crashed around 17 percent to Rs 231 apiece, while Edelweiss Silver ETF fell more than 15 percent. 360 One Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF and others fell around 12-14 percent each.\nAmong the gold ETFs, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF declined around 5.5 percent. Edelweiss Gold ETF, Choice Gold ETF, Axis MF Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, 360 One Gold ETF, SBI Gold ETF and few others fell around 5 percent each.\nWhat lies ahead?\nToday's fall may have been driven by profit booking after two days of gains.\nMarkets are now focused on US ADP non-farm payrolls data and final services PMI readings from major global economies, said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research, Kotak Securities. However, the analyst added that the primary focus remains on Friday\u2019s official US jobs report for signals on the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut.\n\u201cCME FedWatch currently shows no easing priced in until May, with June reflecting just a 44.1% probability of a 25bp cut versus a 44.9% chance of rates being held unchanged,\u201d Chairwala said.\nThe \"flash crash\" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of \"overbought\" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza.\nHe however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. \u201cRecord central bank buying, silver\u2019s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels.

Prices pared gains in post-settlement trading as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed in a social media post that negotiations will be held in Oman on Friday.\nThe commodity surged earlier on reports that the US told Iran it will not agree to Tehran's demands to change the location and format of talks planned for Friday, Axios said, citing two US officials. Adding to bullish momentum, US President Donald Trump said that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"should be very worried\" in an interview with NBC.\nTraders have been closely monitoring the risk of possible US military intervention in Iran, which could disrupt key shipping lanes as well as the country's roughly 3.3 million barrels-per-day oil production.\nDoubts over whether talks surrounding Iran's nuclear program would proceed as planned have intensified since Tuesday, when US and Iranian forces appeared to square off in the sea and air. An Iranian drone approached an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea and was shot down just hours after a US-flagged oil tanker was hailed by small armed ships in the Strait of Hormuz off Iran's coast.\nConcern over a potential conflict in the Middle East, a source of about a third of the world's crude, helped lift prices last month despite signs of a growing oversupply. It has also kept the cost of bullish options high relative to bearish ones for the longest stretch in more than a year.\n\"Geopolitical tensions are really driving it,\" Equinor Chief Financial Officer Torgrim Reitan said in a Bloomberg TV interview. \"The underlying balance is a lower price than there is today, but with everything going on it's very hard to say where this will end.\"\nMeanwhile, US crude inventories fell by 3.5 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's significantly smaller than a forecast by a closely followed industry report, subduing the market's reaction.\nOil Prices\n- WTI for March delivery edged up 3.1% to settle at $65.14 a barrel in New York.\n- Brent for April settlement increased 3.2% to settle at $69.46 a barrel.\nWhat do you think?

The Euro (EUR) softens against the US Dollar (USD) as Eurozone inflation declined well below target ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision. The German Factory Orders and Eurozone Retail Sales are also due later on Thursday.\nData released by Eurostat showed on Wednesday that the Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation eased to 1.7% YoY in January, versus 1.9% prior. Meanwhile, the core HICP rose 2.3% YoY in January, compared to 2.3% in December. Both figures came in line with the expectations. These readings have fueled expectations for future ECB interest rate cuts, which could exert some selling pressure on the shared currency.\nLater on Thursday, all eyes will be on the ECB interest rate decision. Analysts widely anticipate the benchmark interest rates to remain on hold for the fifth consecutive time. Traders will closely watch the ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference for more hints about the interest rate outlook over the coming months.\n\"The emphasis will likely be on higher uncertainty,\" with only minor tweaks in communication, said Bank of America analysts. \u201dOur conviction in a March cut is not rock solid, but we remain convinced of an easing bias from here.\"\nAcross the pond, doubts over the Federal Reserve (Fed) independence could undermine the Greenback and act as a tailwind for the major pair. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would have passed on Kevin Warsh as his nominee to lead the US central bank if Warsh had expressed a desire to hike interest rates, per Bloomberg.\nECB FAQs\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region. The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nIn extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "The European Central Bank convenes for its first policy meeting of 2026 on Thursday, February 5th, and while no rate change is expected, President Christine Lagarde\u2019s messaging could prove pivotal for the euro\u2019s direction.\nWith EUR/USD hovering below the psychologically significant 1.20 level and markets divided on the ECB\u2019s next move, traders are watching closely for clues about the central bank\u2019s policy trajectory amid shifting inflation dynamics, euro strength concerns, and unprecedented uncertainty emanating from Washington.\nAt its final meeting of 2025 in December, the European Central Bank delivered a notably optimistic assessment of the eurozone economy, upgrading its growth forecasts and signaling confidence in its inflation trajectory. The central bank now projects economic growth of 1.4% for 2025 (up from previous estimates), 1.2% for 2026, and a return to 1.4% for both 2027 and 2028.\nOn the inflation front, the ECB\u2019s December projections painted a picture of price pressures gradually normalizing around the central bank\u2019s 2% target. The ECB forecast inflation to average 2.1% in 2025, then decline to 1.9% in 2026 and fall slightly further in 2027, before rebounding back to the 2% target in 2028.\nThese projections were based on an assumption of stable monetary policy, with the ECB signaling that if its forecasts prove accurate, interest rates would likely remain unchanged throughout 2026. The central bank characterized its current policy stance as being in a \u201cgood place\u201d \u2013 with inflation at target, growth at potential, and interest rates in a neutral setting that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy.\nRecent economic data has slightly complicated what had appeared to be a broadly favorable outlook. Figures published by Eurostat for January showed headline inflation in the euro area easing to 1.7%, down from 2.0% in December and its lowest level since September 2024. Even more notable, core inflation unexpectedly slipped to 2.2% from 2.3%, reflecting a continued cooling of price pressures, particularly in the services sector.\nWhile inflation hovering just below target might seem like mission accomplished for the ECB, the downward trend has sparked debate among policymakers about whether disinflationary forces could prove stronger than anticipated. Two particular factors are raising concerns: the sharp appreciation of the euro against the dollar in recent weeks, which reduces import prices and dampens inflation, and the continued influx of lower-priced Chinese goods into European markets, which could exert additional downward pressure on prices.\nECB Governing Council member Gediminas Simkus highlighted the institution\u2019s achievement in being the only major central bank to bring inflation back to target last year, despite an environment marked by U.S. tariffs, the war in Eastern Europe, excess supply from China and rising food prices. Nonetheless, he cautioned that ongoing political instability remains a key risk and could quickly disrupt the current policy balance maintained by the ECB.\nThursday\u2019s meeting is widely expected to result in the ECB holding its three key interest rates steady for the fifth consecutive meeting. The deposit facility rate should remain at 2.00%, the main refinancing operations rate at 2.25%, and the marginal lending facility rate at 2.40%. Markets assign virtually no probability to a rate change at this particular meeting.\nHowever, beneath the surface consensus on holding rates steady this week, a fascinating debate is emerging among ECB officials and economists about what the central bank\u2019s next move will be \u2013 and when it might come.\nSurprisingly, despite inflation running below target, some within the ECB have left the door open to the possibility of rate increases later in 2026. This seemingly counterintuitive stance stems from several factors.\nFirst, the ECB\u2019s upgraded growth outlook suggests the eurozone economy may prove more resilient than previously thought. If growth consistently "

Solid US business activity data is a headwind for the EUR/USD pair.

Other data show that private companies hired less people than expected by the economists, an indication of softness in the labor market.\nThe short US government shutdown has affected the release of crucial jobs data. The JOLTS report, which was expected to be released today, moved to February 5. Meanwhile, the Nonfarm Payrolls will be announced on February 11, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) moved back to February 13.\nAcross the pond, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in January was softer than expected at 1.7% YoY, while core figures stood at 2.2% YoY. The Eurozone headline inflation had increased the odds for a cut, rather than a rate hike, for the ECB.

Institute for Supply Management (ISM) remained unchanged in January, with the ISM Services PMI holding steady at 53.8. The print, however, came in above analysts' expectations of 53.5.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its cu"

Last December, the central bank\u2019s decision to lower rates by 25 basis points was unexpectedly close, with a 5\u20134 split among policymakers, highlighting increasing disagreement within the Monetary Policy Committee.\nFor the current meeting, projections indicate a likely 7\u20132 vote in favor of maintaining the current rate, with just two members supporting another decrease. Although most economists foresee one or two more rate cuts later in the year, financial markets remain more conservative. The one-year Overnight Index Swap suggests there is about an 84% chance of only a single cut, while the three-month OIS points to a roughly 20% probability."

Cable traders are unlikely to pick a meaningful direction until after the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) latest interest rate decision, due during Thursday\u2019s London market session. However, it is unlikely that the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will deliver anything of note that will actually shift long-term fundamentals.\nAfter a razor-thin 5-4 vote to trim interest rates another 25 bps in December, the MPC is broadly expected to hold interest rates steady on Thursday; rate markets show a scant 4.1% chance of a February interest rate cut from the BoE.\nOn the American side, US ADP Employment Change and Initial Jobless Claims are due later on Thursday. However, traders will be looking ahead to the latest Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) figures from January, which were postponed until February 11 thanks to the latest partial US government funding shutdown, which was once again avoided in the eleventh hour.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3652. The 50-day exponential moving average rises to 1.3492 and remains above the 200-day at 1.3340, underscoring a bullish bias. Price holds above the faster average as both slopes point higher, keeping pullbacks contained and favoring further upside.\nStochastic (14,5,5) has retreated from overbought and prints 67.88, indicating momentum has cooled while staying positive. A renewed uptick would keep the advance in gear, while a drop below the 50 line could trigger consolidation toward the rising 50-day EMA at 1.3492.\nIn the 4-hour chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3652. The 200-period exponential moving average rises to 1.3534 and underpins a bullish bias, with price holding decisively above this trend filter. Dips toward this average would meet initial support, while sustained trade above it keeps upside traction intact.\nMomentum cools as the Stochastic (14,5,5) retreats from the 70s to the mid-50s, indicating fading immediate impulse rather than a trend break. A turn higher in the oscillator would re-energize bids and keep the topside in focus. A deeper slide toward the 40 area would point to extended consolidation before trend resumption.\nIn the 15-minute chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3652. Price holds below a declining 200-EMA at 1.3689, maintaining an intraday bearish bias. The average continues to slope lower, highlighting persistent supply on rebounds. Stochastic (14,5,5) has eased from a brief push above the 50 line toward the mid-40s, flagging waning recovery momentum. Below the average, sellers keep control and dips remain favored.\nThe setup stays fragile while the 200-EMA trends lower and caps bounces. A decisive push back above the 50 line on Stochastic would improve momentum, whereas another roll-over from this area would keep pressure on the downside. A close above 1.3689 would be needed to neutralize the immediate bearish tone.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, Imports fell by 0.8% MoM in December, compared to a decline of 0.2% (revised from 0.2%) seen in November.\nMarket reaction to Australia\u2019s Trade Balance\nAt the press time, the AUD/USD pair is up 0.11% on the day to trade at 0.7004.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

If a steady demand in exchange for Australian exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the AUD.\nHow could the Australian Trade Data affect AUD/USD?\nAUD/USD trades on a negative note on the day in the lead up to the Australian Trade Data. The pair loses ground as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens amid shifting expectations for the Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy after US President Donald Trump nominated former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as Fed chair last week.\nIf data comes in better than expected, it could lift the Australian Dollar (AUD), with the first upside barrier seen at the February 3 high of 0.7050. The next resistance level emerges at the January 29 high of 0.7094, en route to the January 26, 2023, high of 0.7142\nTo the downside, the February 3 low of 0.6945 will offer some comfort to buyers. Extended losses could see a drop to the January 26 low of 0.6906. The next contention level is located at the January 23 low of 0.6834.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of t"

It jumped to a high of 0.700, up sharply from this week's low of 0.6900\nTop Regulated Brokers\nRBA Raised Interest Rates\nThe AUD/USD exchange rate has been in a strong uptrend in the past few weeks as odds of a divergence between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Federal Reserve rose.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the RBA delivered a highly hawkish interest rate decision. It hiked interest rates by 0.25% to 3.85% in a bid to fight the elevated inflation rate.\nThe rate hike made it an outlier as most central banks are cutting interest rates. For example, the Federal Reserve has delivered three interest rate cuts in the past few months and analysts believe that the bank will deliver more cuts this year.\nThe RBA rate hike came after recent data showed that the labor market has improved, while inflation has jumped to over 3%, much higher than the bank's target of 2.0%.\nAnalysts at some of the biggest banks predicted that the bank may hike interest rates again in May this year as the economy runs close to capacity.

Economists expect the data to show that the ISM services PMI slipped to 53.5 from the previous 54.4.\nThe pair will also react to the upcoming ADP jobs report. Economists expect the data to show that the previous sector created over 48k jobs in January after adding over 45k a month earlier.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the AUD/USD pair has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months.

                "body": "Japan election preview: What a big LDP win could mean for the economy, bonds and the yen\nJapan's PM, Sanae Takaichi, looks set for a big victory in the upcoming 8 February election. Takaichi needs to find a balance between more spending and fiscal sustainability. Structural changes in the economy should send JGB yields higher. We believe it is a path towards a normal economy. And USD/JPY strength will likely demand sustained intervention\nWhy did Takaichi call a snap election so early?\nTakaichi has called a snap election just three months into the job, taking a high-risk move. It is all about securing a public mandate for her policy.\nShe inherited a troubled party and a minority government in October after Ishiba Shigeru, who lost both parliamentary elections, was nearly forced to resign. The LDP lost public support with a cost-of-living crisis and several political funding scandals. Despite only narrowly becoming prime minister, her approval ratings during the first three months were surprisingly strong at around 70%. Now, she seeks to leverage her popularity to secure a sole majority for the LDP and thereby advance her policy agenda later with greater consistency. She supports former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s policies, advocating pro-stimulus macro policies and a Japan-focused foreign policy. Opposition parties may not fully agree with her policy perspectives. Should the minority government situation persist, she will have to negotiate with other parties on each policy issue. However, if she wins this election, she will interpret it as Japanese voters' endorsement of her pledges and will push her policy agenda much more forcefully.\nRecent polls suggested a landslide victory by the LDP\nAccording to recent local polls, the LDP leads the campaign for sure. The LDP is expected to well exceed a simple majority of 233 seats (vs its current 198 seats) and the alliance may reach near 300. In contrast, the main opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, could lose almost half of its current seats. If the LDP coalition secures a super majority, the government would gain significantly more power. This would allow Takaichi to pass legislation even without having sufficient support in the Upper House.\nThe LDP is likely to secure a sole majority in the lower house\nThe tone regarding food tax cuts remained low-key\nAlthough the food consumption tax cut was a major topic before the campaign, its prominence diminished once the campaign began.\nJapanese inflation has stayed above 2% since April 2022, but wages have lagged behind. The rise in living costs has increased public dissatisfaction. For instance, rice, the primary staple food, gained almost 100% year-on-year by mid-2025, although it came down to the 30% level recently. So, reducing inflation became a primary focus of the election campaign. Takaichi resumed energy subsidies last year via the supplementary budget. We see the impact of the subsidy from the recent sharp decline in inflation readings.\nThe focus has now turned to food prices. The food consumption tax rate of 8% is expected to reduce inflation by approximately one percentage point though at a cost of \u00a55 trillion revenue loss (6% of total tax revenue). Although households may benefit from lower living costs, markets are worried about fiscal stability due to uncertain funding for the tax cuts.\nHowever, after experiencing recent market volatility, Takaichi has adopted a more cautious stance on food tax cuts. She has avoided directly addressing the proposal during the campaign, focusing instead on \u201cresponsible and proactive public finances\u201d. Now she remains vague on implementation timing and prefers to \u201caccelerate the discussion\u201d to keep the agenda neutral.\nFood and energy prices soared, a main source of public dissatisfaction\nWill Takaichi\u2019s major win truly have a significant impact on fiscal policy?\nThe market seems to have a fear that Takaichi's big victory may hurt fiscal conditions quite badly. We don't fully agree with it. "

Investors remain worried about Japan's financial health on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary fiscal plans. This, along with political uncertainty ahead of the snap election on February 8, has been another bearish development for the JPY and contributes to its relative underperformance.\nMeanwhile, softer consumer inflation figures from Japan's capital city \u2013 Tokyo \u2013 released last week tempered bets for an early interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), further undermining the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, climbs to a two-week top and keeps the USD/JPY pair close to the 157.00 mark. That said, bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut rates two more times in 2026 might cap the USD. Moreover, speculations that Japanese authorities would step in to stem further JPY weakness warrant caution for bears.\nJapanese Yen bulls remain on the sidelines amid fiscal and political woes\n- The incumbent Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is poised to score a strong victory in the lower house election on February 8. The outcome would give Takaichi a greater grip on Japan's parliament and more headroom to carry out her expansionary fiscal plans.\n- Takaichi pledged to suspend the 8% consumption tax on food for two years as part of her election campaign, raising concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook amid fears of debt-funded spending. This has been a key factor behind the Japanese Yen's relative underperformance since the beginning of this week.\n- Moreover, Takaichi talked up the benefits of a weaker currency during a campaign speech. Although Takaichi later softened the stance, her comments raised doubts over whether authorities would intervene to support the domestic currency. This exerts additional downward pressure on the JPY.\n- Meanwhile, data released last Friday showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Japan's capital city \u2013 Tokyo \u2013 fell last month to its weakest level since February 2022. This pointed to signs of softer demand-driven price pressure and reduced urgency for the Bank of Japan to tighten further.\n- However, the Summary of Opinions from the BoJ's January meeting this week highlighted board members' hawkish view amid mounting price pressures from a weak JPY. Moreover, a private survey showed that Japan\u2019s services sector growth accelerated in January at its fastest pace in almost a year.\n- This suggests that a BoJ rate hike in the first half of 2026 remains on the table. In contrast, traders are pricing in the possibility of two more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which caps the USD/JPY pair near the 157.00 mark, or a nearly two-week top set earlier this Thursday.\n- In fact, US President Donald Trump said that he would have passed on Kevin Warsh as his nominee to lead the Federal Reserve if he had expressed a desire to hike interest rates. Trump further added that there was not much doubt that the US central bank would lower interest rates.\n- The US Dollar, however, has climbed to a fresh high since January 23 in the wake of hawkish comments from Fed Governor Lisa Cook, saying that risks are skewed toward higher inflation. This could support the USD/JPY pair as traders now look to a duo of US labor market reports for a fresh impetus.\n- Thursday's US economic docket features the delayed release of the JOLTS Job Openings data, along with the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims.

Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

The pair\u2019s reversal from weekly highs above 1.3700 has been contained above 1.3625, with USD downside attempts limited, ahead of the release of January\u2019s ADP Employment Change report.\nThe ADP report will be analysed with particular interest later on Monday, as the crucial Nonfarm Payrolls release, scheduled for Friday, will be delayed due to a partial government shutdown.\nPrivate-sector employment is expected to have shown net job creation of 48K in January, up from 41K in December. These figures are consistent with the stalled labour market seen in 2025, at levels well below the 186K net jobs monthly average seen in 2024.\nThe data, however, endorses the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) stance of gradual monetary easing and is likely to provide additional support to the US Dollar, already buoyed by the end of a two-day government shutdown and the positive impact of Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination as the next Fed chairman.\nIn Canad\u00e1, the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI released on Monday revealed that factory activity grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, offsetting the impact of the weak monthly Gross Domestic Product growth seen last week.

                "body": "GBP/USD Bounce, GBP/JPY Fresh High Ahead of BoE\nIn yesterday\u2019s webinar I shared my continued affinity for GBP-strength for scenarios of USD-weakness. There was a big spot of support that has come into play that\u2019s since run into resistance and tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England rate decision will likely play a role here, although, paradoxically, it\u2019s the Japanese Yen that may have a larger input on the matter, which I\u2019ll explain further below.\nIn GBP/USD, we\u2019re in between the nexus of two long-term trendlines. The longer-term trendline connects the 2022 high to the 2025 swing highs, the projection of which was in-play just last week. Bears couldn\u2019t contain the pressure as the USD got a bearish push when President Trump remarked that he though the currency\u2019s weakness was \u2018great.\u2019\nOn a shorter-term basis, there\u2019s a trendline connecting last year\u2019s swing highs that\u2019s since come in as support that we\u2019ll take a closer look at in a moment.\nGBP/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD Shorter-Term\nIn yesterday\u2019s webinar I looked at a resistance level at 1.3768, which is simply a swing-high from last September, right around when the Fed started cutting rates. That price has since come in, along with the longer-term trendline projection, to hold today\u2019s high and as of now the daily bar is showing as a bearish engulfing candlestick.\nThose are difficult formations because there\u2019s both a wide distance for risk placement but also an undeniable tonality change. With a BoE meeting tomorrow the range of possible scenarios opens but I think one of the more proactive ways to work with something like this, particularly if we close with a confirmed bearish engulf on the daily, is to look for initial continuation down for a deeper support test.\nThis sets up 1.3623 as a \u2018s1\u2019 support with the prior point of resistance at 1.3568 as an \u2018s2.\u2019 And for \u2018s3\u2019 I\u2019m looking to the familiar 1.3500 psychological level.\nWith that said, there may be greener pastures elsewhere for Sterling strength, which I\u2019ll look at below with GBP/JPY.\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nEarlier I commented that the Japanese Yen may have more impact on GBP flows against the US Dollar than the Bank of England rate decision, which understandably might sound confusing. But one just needs to look at what happened two weeks ago when USD/JPY snapped for illustration of what I\u2019m referring to, and the reason this happens is because of how powerful major pairs can be in comparison to cross pairs.\nWith a heavy one-sided position still holding on in USD/JPY, if we see reversion and USD-weakness against JPY-strength, that USD-weakness can certainly show elsewhere, as can JPY-strength. This is why both EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY got hit so hard two weeks ago, and it\u2019s also why EUR/USD and GBP/USD rallied against the US Dollar back in Q3 of 2024 when the initial repercussions of carry unwind began to show.\nIn response to those sell-offs I continued to draw attention to the technical structure of GBP/JPY, which saw four consecutive days of support holding at the 210.00 level. If you want a further explanation behind these setups I went in-depth in webinars two weeks ago and then again yesterday, and since, GBP/JPY has pushed up for a fresh 18-year high.\nGBP/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY Structure\nAfter the fresh high in GBP/JPY we now have some squaring up ahead of the Bank of England tomorrow and given adherence to prior structure, there\u2019s a few zones of interest to look for support. The first is already nearby at 213.50 and that\u2019s followed by 212.60. Below that is a key area at 211.42-211.59 and this is a prior spot of resistance from a previous range and ideally that\u2019s what buyers would defend before allowing for another test of the contentious 210.00 zone. Hope isn\u2019t necessarily lost on the long side if that 210 zone comes into play but a reversal o"

Spot prices, for now, seem to have snapped a four-day winning streak and currently trade around the 213.70 region, down nearly 0.25% for the day, amid some repositioning ahead of the key central bank event.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is scheduled to announce its policy decision later today and is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold amid supportive fundamentals. Traders, however, are still pricing in the possibility that the UK central bank will lower borrowing costs at least two more times in 2026. Hence, the market focus will remain glued to MPC vote distribution and the post-meeting press conference, where comments from BoE Governor Andrew Bailey will influence the British Pound (GBP) and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/JPY cross.\nIn the meantime, some follow-through US Dollar (USD) buying is seen weighing on the GBP. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, might continue with its relative underperformance amid worries about the country's financial health on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary fiscal plans and political uncertainty ahead of the snap election on February 8.

The trade has retained favour as Takaichi looks to leverage her popularity by calling elections, due next week, where polling shows she should cement her power with a comfortable win.\nThe Bank of Japan could provide a counterweight to yen weakness if it indicates it is willing to raise interest rates.\nAnother upcoming JPY risk event is the replacement of Asahi Noguchi, whose term on the Bank of Japan's policy board will expire at the end of March.\nWho Takaichi chooses as a replacement will send a powerful message as to how she thinks Bank of Japan policy should play out.\nThe choice will be between 'reflationists' and 'hawks'; a reflationist would promote a policy of lower-for-longer interest rates in order to stimulate the economy and inflation.\nHowever, Mizuho warns that should Takaichi end up opting for a \"reflationist\" just as she previously did when choosing advisors to the Council for Japan's Growth Strategy and Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, \"then we would expect the yen to weaken yet further.\"\nThis is because markets would sense a true \"reflationary\" intent on the part of the Takaichi administration.\nDownward pressure on the yen has recently eased on signs that Japanese authorities are preparing to intervene directly in the market to shore up the currency.\nHowever, without a clear fundamental shift on fiscal and monetary policy, such interventions will only delay the currency's depreciation."

                "body": "iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT:FBTC) both deliver pure-play bitcoin exposure with identical expense ratios, but differ in assets under management, trading statistics, and subtle variations in historical performance and risk.\nBoth iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund are designed for investors seeking straightforward access to bitcoin price performance through traditional brokerage accounts, avoiding the technical and custody challenges of holding cryptocurrency directly. This comparison highlights the practical differences that may matter most for those weighing these two leading spot bitcoin ETFs.\nSnapshot (cost & size)\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.\nBoth funds are priced at 0.25% annually, making them more affordable than most actively managed vehicles targeting alternative assets. With no dividend or yield offered by either ETF, cost efficiency is the primary differentiator on fees.\nPerformance & risk comparison\nWhat's inside\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is a straightforward vehicle for bitcoin exposure, holding 99.98% of assets in Bitcoin (XBTUSD) and the remainder in net other assets. Sector allocation is not reported, but with just two holdings and over two years on the market, the fund is focused exclusively on tracking bitcoin\u2019s price. There are no notable quirks or leverage resets, and the fund does not track a named index.\niShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is even more concentrated, with 100% of its portfolio in bitcoin and cash, and no sector diversification. Its assets under management (AUM) are much larger, at roughly $64.8 billion, and the fund\u2019s top holdings mirror FBTC\u2019s, with bitcoin dominating the exposure. Like FBTC, IBIT is structured for simplicity, with no additional overlays or quirks.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.\nWhat this means for investors\nThese are the two largest spot bitcoin ETFs available to investors, but IBIT is far and away the largest at around $65 billion in assets under management. FBTC is a distant second with about $17.7 billion.\nThere really is no difference in holdings, as both are 100% invested in bitcoin and have basically identical returns. Both are down about 16.3% year-to-date and 26% over the past 12 months, as of Feb. 4.\nThe similarities don\u2019t end there, as the two ETFs carry the same expense ratio of 0.25%. IBIT had a lower ratio to start, but it is now 0.25% for new investors.\nSo, what, if anything, would give the edge to one of these ETFs over the other? Obviously, if you are a Fidelity brokerage customer, it would be more convenient to buy on the Fidelity platform and have custody handled in-house. It would also be kept with your other investments.\nThe advantage IBIT has is that it provides greater liquidity from significantly more trading volume. This typically results in lower trading costs and faster trade execution.\nSo, in reality, there is not a huge difference between the two aside from convenience for Fidelity brokerage customers and the liquidity edge for the iShares ETF."

                "body": "From $561M inflows to sudden exits \u2013 Inside Bitcoin ETF\u2019s February shock\nAfter four straight days of heavy outflows that wiped out more than $1.5 billion, U.S Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs finally saw a rebound on 02 February. Investors poured in $561.8 million in net inflows, signaling renewed confidence from large institutions.\nAs Bitcoin hovered near the $75,000-level, major players appeared to view the drop as a buying opportunity. Here, it\u2019s worth pointing out though that at press time, the cryptocurrency had fallen by another 6% to trade close to $70,000.\nFidelity Investments\u2019 FBTC led the inflows with $153.3 million, followed by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT with $142 million.\nThis suggested that big asset managers were stepping in, even as retail investors remained cautious.\nNeedless to say, this optimism did not last long.\nBitcoin ETFs see outflows\nLess than a day later, on 03 February, the trend reversed itself again.\nBitcoin ETFs recorded $272 million in net outflows, showing that institutions were quick to pull back when the prices failed to move higher. Such a sharp shift may be evidence of growing uncertainty in the market.\nThe outflows were led by Fidelity Investments\u2019 FBTC, which lost $148.7 million, almost wiping out its gains from the previous day. This was followed by Ark Invest\u2019s ARKB with $62.5 million in outflows and a combined $90.4 million from Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin funds.\nOn the contrary, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT was the only major fund to see inflows \u2013 Adding about $60 million.\nOther altcoin ETFs\u2019 analysis\nHowever, this was not enough to support the market. In fact, more interesting than the outflows from Bitcoin is where some of the money appeared to be going.\nFor instance, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs attracted $14 million in new inflows.\nMeanwhile, Ripple [XRP] ETFs gained $19.46 million, and Solana [SOL] ETFs added $0.9 million.\nThis suggested that while investors have been reducing their exposure to Bitcoin, some are doing so by shifting towards other digital assets instead of leaving the market entirely.\nWhat\u2019s more?\nIt may also be a sign that institutions are not leaving crypto altogether. Instead, they are reducing risk and spreading their investments.\nOn 01 February too, about $509.7 million flowed out of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, setting the tone for a difficult week. By the end of the period, total outflows had reached $1.7 billion \u2013 The largest drop in liquidity since mid-November.\nThese sharp February outflows underline a shift in sentiment, showing that even institutional investors are no longer immune to short-term uncertainty in the crypto market.\nFinal Thoughts\n- Sharp swings in Bitcoin ETF flows highlight growing uncertainty among institutional investors.\n- February\u2019s whipsaw revealed that institutions are still searching for stable entry points."

While bitcoin ETFs have borne the brunt of near-term de-risking, capital is still moving within the crypto complex, favoring assets perceived as offering distinct use cases or relative value."

Developers could only deploy smart contracts on so-called Polkadot parachains, which fragmented the ecosystem and added complexity for users.\nThe new functionality lets developers deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot, either using Ethereum-compatible tools or using the blockchain\u2019s own architecture.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already building with Solidity, the experience will feel familiar,\u201d Parity said in an X post announcing the smart contract upgrade.\nThe hope is that by making itself Ethereum compatible, Polkadot can encourage Ethereum developers to build on the blockchain.\nSolana vs Ethereum\nYet some critics say the push for Ethereum compatibility is misguided.\n\u201cIf they treated this as a side project and didn\u2019t sacrifice a whole lot of other things like Ink, then it may make sense. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Wei Tang, previously a core developer for Ethereum and Polkadot, said on X.\nInk is the primary Rust-based smart contract language for the Polkadot ecosystem. Rust is the main smart contract language used on Solana. Development and maintenance of Ink effectively ended in January due to a lack of funding.\nIn effect, Polkadot is trading compatibility with Solana for Ethereum.\nThe problem, Tang said, is that the implementation is built on a misunderstanding of Ethereum compatibility, resulting in slower transactions than anticipated.\n\u201cEven if they implement everything to the very end of their roadmap, it wouldn\u2019t be faster than Ethereum layer 2s,\u201d Tang said.\nStill, Parity is confident it will be proven right in the end \u2014 even if adoption is currently slow.\n\u201cEarly on-chain metrics mean little at this stage,\u201d the Parity spokesp"

                "body": "Ethereum Flushes Into Major Demand: $2,150 Hold Could Change Everything\nEthereum has seen a sharp sell-off that sent the price straight into a major demand zone near $2,150, which is now acting as the market\u2019s last line of defense. Whether buyers step in here or fail to hold the line could determine if this move becomes a temporary liquidity flush or the start of a deeper trend shift.\nETH Loses Key Support As Short-Term Momentum Turns Bearish\nMichael Van De Poppe noted that Ethereum has slipped below a crucial support zone, signaling increased short-term pressure. On the lower timeframes, price action has turned clearly bearish. However, zooming out to the higher timeframes, the broader structure remains intact, with ETH still trading within a larger uptrend.\nHe pointed out that Ethereum likely marked its cycle low back in April 2025, suggesting the current weakness may be corrective rather than the start of a sustained bearish phase. At this stage, ETH appears to be searching for a higher-timeframe support level that could act as a base for a renewed move to the upside.\nVan de Poppe highlighted the 0.025\u20130.0265 BTC region as a key support zone on the ETH/BTC pair. Importantly, the recent correction has already retraced more than half of the move toward this level, increasing the likelihood that demand could step in around that range.\nOn the upside, he added that a recovery above the 0.0325 BTC level. While less likely in the near term, it would be a strong signal that bullish momentum has returned and a continuation of the broader uptrend. Despite ongoing volatility, Van de Poppe remains confident that Ethereum will significantly outperform Bitcoin over time. Thus, he will continue to accumulate ETH at these levels.\nSharp Sell-Off Drives Ethereum Into Major Demand Near $2,150\nIn a more recent update, Dami-DeFi pointed out that Ethereum failed to hold the rising support line near the $2,800 level, which he had previously identified as critical. This breakdown was confirmed on the daily timeframe, triggering a sharp sell-off that pushed the price swiftly into the next major demand zone around $2,150.\nIf buyers manage to defend this level, the recent drop could be interpreted as a liquidity sweep followed by a market reset, rather than the start of a deeper downtrend. In that case, price action would likely shift into a choppy consolidation phase, with ETH rebuilding structure between $2,150 and $2,700.\nAccording to Dami-DeFi, a meaningful bullish shift only comes into play if Ethereum can reclaim $2,700 and then establish acceptance above $2,850. Until those levels are recovered and held, any upside attempts are likely to remain corrective, with the market still focused on whether demand can firmly step in at current levels."

During its test phase, Tramplin observed periods of elevated effective APY for small stakers, driven by initial committed stake and redistribution dynamics.\nMarket Context\nThe idea behind Tramplin originated in a broader concern about how retail users have participated in crypto over the past market cycles.\nSince 2021, a significant share of new activity has been driven by memecoin speculation, extreme leverage, and short-term trading models where smaller participants consistently enter late and exit at a disadvantage.\nRather than creating long-term value, much of the market has become optimized for volatility and rapid capital redistribution, often resulting in systematic losses for retail users.\nBuilt on Native Staking, Without Added Risk\nTramplin operates entirely within Solana\u2019s native staking framework, with users delegating directly to the validator node and no smart-contract custody or counterparty risk.\nBy combining provably fair randomness (via VRF), Merkle-based transparency, and the security of native staking, Tramplin is designed to make staking more engaging, equitable, and accessible, without introducing new risk vectors.\nPublic Launch and Partner Program\nAlongside its launch, Tramplin is opening its Strategic Partner Program, inviting creators, analysts, auditors, and ecosystem builders to participate in reviewing, validating, and sharing the protocol with their communities.\nThe Partner Program is designed to offer a low-overhead, transparent alternative to running a private validator, while preserving Solana\u2019s native security model.\nThe program features audit-first transparency, lifetime revenue sharing, and community Boost Points. Additional details about Tramplin and its Partner Program are available at https://tramplin.io\nAbout Tramplin\nTramplin is a premium staking platform built on Solana with verifiable and random distribution of outsized rewards.\nFounded in early 2025, Tramplin\u2019s mission is to empower SOL holders \u2014 the backbone of the Solana ecosystem \u2014 with opportunities traditionally reserved for whales, without compromising capital safety.\nTramplin is backed by iTreasury ventures, an early investor in Solana, Polkadot, and several other category-defining blockchain projects.\nContact\nMarketing team\nValidator LLC\npr@tramplin.io\nThis article contains a press release from an external source.

AI disruption concerns have hammered software stocks this year, and the release of workplace productivity tools from AI startup Anthropic yesterday amplified those fears.\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks were lower Tuesday as investors rotated out of technology firms. Five finished down Wednesday, with Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) the biggest decliners at 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) were 2% lower ahead of its quarterly results after the close, and those of Amazon (AMZN), which reports earnings tomorrow afternoon, were down 2.4%.\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sank 17% even though it reported better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance.\nIn other post-earnings moves, shares of Enphase Energy (ENPH) soared 39%, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) jumped 14%, Eli Lilly (LLY) surged 10% to move back above $1 trillion in market cap, Match Group (MTCH) advanced 6%, Boston Scientific (BSX) dropped 18%, AbbVie (ABBV) declined 4%, Uber Technologies (UBER) fell 5%, and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) was down 5%. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock rose almost 2% ahead of its results after markets close.\nSilicon Laboratories (SLAB) shares skyrocketed nearly 50% after the company was acquired by fellow semiconductor firm Texas Instruments (TXN) for about $7.5 billion in an all-cash transaction. Texas Instruments shares edged lower.\nBitcoin sank as low as $72,100\u2014its lowest level since November 2024\u2014before paring some losses to trade around $73,500 at 4 p.m. ET. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of global currencies, rose 0.2% to 97.66 but remains near four-year lows.\nGold futures were up 0.7% to $4,970 an ounce and silver futures added 4% to $86.75 an ounce. The precious metals rebounded sharply yesterday after traders locked in profits following their surges to roughly $5,625 and $121.75, respectively, last Thursday.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury\u2014which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages\u2014ticked higher to 4.28% from Tuesday's close below 4.27%. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, rose 2% to $64.50 a barrel.\nEly Lilly and Novo Nordisk Shares Are Diverging\nThere's a growing divergence between the shares of rival weight-loss drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\nEli Lilly's (LLY) stock jumped over 10% Wednesday on the company's stronger-than-expected earnings and rosy outlook. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk (NVO) saw its U.S.-listed shares sink 6%, a day after the Danish drugmaker warned its sales could take a hit this year.\nThe moves have widened the gap between the shares, which started to pull apart last fall after a series of promising trials and boom in sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound for Eli Lilly, while Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk's growth slowed.\nNovo Nordisk's stock rallied late last year after it was the first to win approval for a pill version of its weight-loss drugs, but today's move reversed those gains.\nEli Lilly said Wednesday that its revenue surged 45% last year to $65.18 billion, while Novo Nordisk reported Tuesday that its sales grew just 6% in 2025 to 309.06 billion Danish kroner ($48.84 billion).\nNovo Nordisk also warned its sales could decline this year, while Eli Lilly forecasted growth. Novo Nordisk pointed to lower prices in the U.S. as part of an agreement with the Trump administration, less Medicaid coverage for its weight-loss drugs, and increased compe"

That strengthens the case for European Central Bank doves to talk about cuts, even if policymakers aren\u2019t likely to move immediately. But Germany\u2019s activity data was a reminder that easier inflation isn\u2019t the same as strong momentum: the final HCOB composite PMI rose to 52.1, yet missed the flash reading, and services cooled to a fo..\nur-month low. Put together, markets are weighing a friendlier rates backdrop against a still-fragile growth picture.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Lower inflation isn\u2019t a free pass for stocks.\nSofter core inflation can pull expected rate paths down, which typically helps valuations. But if growth expectations slip at the same time, equity gains can be harder to sustain \u2013 and Germany\u2019s softer final PMI hints at that trade-off. Moves were also very company-specific: Henkel jumped after agreeing to buy coatings maker Stahl for \u20ac2.1 billion, and BASF rose as a minority holder selling into the deal.\nThe bigger picture: The ECB is edging toward its next phase.\nWith headline inflation now below the ECB\u2019s 2% target and core drifting lower, the debate is shifting from \u201chow long to keep rates restrictive\u201d to \u201cwhen is it safe to ease.\u201d If import prices stay subdued and the dollar remains weaker, disinflation could broaden, making future decisions more about supporting demand than fighting prices.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is trading in a confident, upward-tilted regime, with German blue chips showing renewed strength after previous phases of choppy consolidation. Buyers are clearly active, defending pullbacks and pushing the index closer to psychological high zones, while bears keep trying and failing to trigger a real flush. Volatility is not extreme, but every dip is being watched by both sides as a potential trap or launchpad. European equities overall are leaning risk-on, yet there is an undercurrent of caution: nobody believes this move is a free lunch.\nInstead of a clean melt-up or a dramatic crash, the DAX is in a grinding, disciplined uptrend where algorithms, hedge funds, and retail traders are all testing each other\u2019s conviction. There is meaningful upside momentum, but it is constantly challenged by macro headlines and profit-taking bursts. In other words: German bulls are back, but they are skating on thin macro ice.\nThe Story: What is driving this latest phase of strength in the DAX 40? You can sum it up in three big forces: the European Central Bank, the German industrial cycle, and the global risk-on mood powered by expectations around interest rates and the dollar.\n1. ECB and the Rate Game\nAll eyes remain on the European Central Bank. After one of the most aggressive hiking cycles in its history to fight inflation, the ECB is now in a more delicate phase. Inflation in the euro area has eased from its peak, but it is not fully tamed, while growth indicators in Germany have looked fragile for months. This mix creates a permanent push\u2013pull in the DAX.\nOn the bullish side, traders are betting that the next major step over the coming quarters will be a gradual pivot toward rate cuts or at least a more supportive stance. Every hint from ECB officials that policy could soften is interpreted as fuel for exporters, banks, and cyclical industrials. Lower borrowing costs plus cheaper capital would be a direct shot of adrenaline for corporate earnings and equity valuations.\nOn the bearish side, the risk is clear: if the ECB stays hawkish for longer or signals renewed inflation worries, the market\u2019s lofty expectations get slapped down. That would hit high-beta sectors first and could trigger a broader derating of the DAX\u2019s strongest names. So the index is effectively trading as a leveraged bet on the ECB\u2019s ability to cool inflation without crushing Germany\u2019s already bruised economy.\n2. German Industry, Energy, and the Real Economy\nUnder the hood, not everything is sunshine. Germany has been wrestling with weak manufacturing data, soft orders, and persistent worries about deindustrialization. Key sectors like autos, chemicals, and machinery have all felt pressure from high energy prices, global competition, and slower demand from China.\nHowever, equity markets are forward-looking. The recent resilience of the DAX reflects hopes that the worst of the industrial slowdown is behind us and that Germany can stabilize around a low but positive growth path. Energy prices, while not cheap, are off their peak shock levels, taking some pressure off heavy industry. The euro, trading in a moderate range versus the dollar, is not aggressively squeezing exporters either. A weaker euro would boost overseas revenues for DAX heavyweights; a stronger euro would help on imported energy and input costs. Right now, the balance is roughly neutral, which helps the market focus on company execution rather than pure FX pain.\nTraders are also selectively rewarding companies that have adapted: cutting costs, pivoting toward higher-margin segm"

Amazon (AMZN) slid over 2%, and Tesla (TSLA) sank more than 3%.\nEven better-than-expected earnings are no longer enough to convince the market, JPMorgan warned, unless the company reporting can show that AI will be a tailwind rather than a headwind. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares plummeted as the chipmaker's weak sales outlook cast doubt on its ability to take on AI bellwether Nvidia.\nIn a sign of cracks in the labor market, an ADP report showed employers added just 22,000 jobs in January, versus the 45,000 expected. Private data has taken on outsized importance amid the delay in federal jobs data from the partial government shutdown that ended Tuesday, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics has rescheduled the official jobs report for next Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, gold (GC=F) gained amid US-Iran tensions, but its comeback from a hefty record-shedding slump faltered as it fell back below $5,000 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) losses also piled up, as the cryptocurrency traded near $72,000 at one point.\nIn corporates, pharma fortunes diverged as Eli Lilly's (LLY) stock jumped after it posted an upbeat 2026 profit forecast thanks to soaring demand for its weight-loss drugs. But shares in rival Novo Nordisk (NVO, NOVO-B.CO) tumbled after the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy shocked investors by forecasting a steep drop in sales.\nLIVE 25 updates"

                "body": "Nikkei 225 Index forecast as foreigners buy ahead of Japan election\nThe Nikkei 225 Index held steady near its all-time high in the third week, continuing the strong bull run that has been going on for years. It was trading at \u00a553,770, up sharply from the 2022 low of \u00a524,200.\nJapan stocks continued their rally as traders reacted to earnings by some of the biggest companies in the country, including Mitsubishi UFJ, Mitsubishi Heavy, Marubeni, Nintendo, and Mitsui.\nJapan stocks jump ahead of election\nThe next important catalyst for the Nikkei 225 Index will be the upcoming election, which will solidify Sanae Takaichi\u2019s reign. Polls and experts believe that she will win by a landslide, a move that will usher in a period of more government spending and tax cuts in the country.\nTakaichi has already announced a big $175 billion stimulus meant to ease the cost of living as inflation remains elevated in Japan. She has promised to deliver more tax cuts once she becomes elected as the Prime Minister.\nThe Nikkei 225 and Topix indices will likely continue rising when the election ends on February 8.\nHowever, a victory could lead to some challenges, including the Japanese yen crash. Data shows that the USDJPY exchange rate has risen in the last four consecutive days and is slowly nearing the year-to-date high of 159.40. It has jumped by over 12% from its lowest level in 2025, raising odds that the Trump administration will intervene.\nMore Nikkei 225 Index companies will release the earnings in the coming days. Mitsubishi, Nippon Telegraph, Suzuki, Fujifilm, Tokyo Electron, Itochu, and Subaru will release their numbers on Thursday and Friday.\nOther companies to watch next week will be Honda Motor, Recruit Holdings, Fujikora, Japan Tobacco, Softbank,, and Tokio Marine will publish their earnings.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index has done well as foreigners continue to accumulate. Data compiled by TradingEconomics shows that foreigners bought Japan stocks worth over \u00a5494 billion and bonds worth over \u00a5713 billion last week.\nSony stock jumped by 6% on Thursday, making it one of the best-performing companies in Nikkei 225 Index. It reported a 22% improvement in profit and boosted its forward guidance. It now expects to make an operating profit of $9.8 billion in the quarter to March.\nNikkei 225 Index technical analysis\nNikkei 225 Index chart | Source: TradingView\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the Nikkei 225 Index has been in an uptrend in the past few years, mirroring the performance of the global stock market.\nThe bull run has faded recently as investors waited for the upcoming elections. It has remained above all moving averages, a sign that the bull run is continuing.\nHowever, it has formed a rising wedge pattern, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines, which are nearing their peak.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have formed a bearish divergence pattern. Therefore, the index will likely retreat in the coming days, potentially to the key support level at \u00a552,000. A move above the all-time high of \u00a555,070 will point to more gains."

                "body": "By Stella Qiu\nSYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) \u2013 Asian stocks slumped on Thursday as concerns about the exploding costs of AI investment encouraged a rotation out of tech, while a renewed slide in silver squeezed leveraged positions that were already under water.\nGoogle parent Alphabet reported solid results on Wednesday, but it was targeting capital expenditure of $175 billion to $185 billion this year, sharply above analysts\u2019 estimates. Shares swung wildly \u2013 down over 6% at one point -before settling just 0.4% lower after-hours.\nInvestors have been rotating out of technology giants and into defensive stocks such as Walmart amid fears of AI disruptions to jobs. The recent selloff, triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic\u2019s Claude large language model, has wiped out about $830 billion in market value since January 28.\nDisappointing earnings results from Advanced Micro Devices didn\u2019t help either, with the chipmaker tumbling 17% overnight.\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbled 1.7%, weighed by a 3.6% plunge in South Korea\u2019s KOSPI. Taiwanese shares lost 1.1% but financials and real estate outperformed.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei skidded 0.7%, while healthcare, real estate and utilities were all up.\n\u201cThat increase in (Alphabet) capex was absolutely enormous,\u201d said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG.\n\u201cAt a time when everyone is hyper-sensitive and hyper-nervous about what\u2019s going on with the software companies, with what\u2019s going on with CAPEX and AI valuations\u2026 I would have thought the reaction would be quite negative.\u201d\nU.S. stock futures attempted a recovery early in Asia but that quicky lost momentum. Both Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 were last off 0.1%, while EURO STOXX 50 futures slipped 0.3%.\nBitcoin prices also tumbled 1.8% to $71,404, the lowest level since November 2024.\nMuch attention is on Amazon\u2019s results later in the day, as well as policy meetings from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank where rates are expected to be on hold.\nSILVER TUMBLES AGAIN\nPrecious metals also dived on Thursday to snap two days of gains after an epic implosion last week saw them plunging from lofty record highs.\nSilver tumbled 15% to $74.6 an ounce, just a touch above the recent low of $71.32. Gold also fell 1.8% to $4,863 an ounce.\nThe risk sensitive Australian dollar fell 0.4% to $0.6969, while the Kiwi also slipped 0.3% to $0.5984.\nThe Japanese yen was steady at 156.82 per dollar, after falling for four straight days ahead of a general election on Sunday where polls are tipping a decisive victory for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, endorsing her spending ambitions that have raised concerns about the nation\u2019s strained finances.\nIn the Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield slipped 2 basis points at 4.2595%. The U.S. non-farm payrolls report for January has been pushed back from its scheduled release on Friday to February 11 due to a four-day partial government shutdown that has now ended.\nOil prices fell on Thursday after two straight days of gains as the U.S. and Iran agreed to hold talks in Oman on Friday, despite differences about the agenda. [O/R]\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.4% to $64.23 per barrel, while Brent crude futures also dropped 1.4% to $68.47 per barrel.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"
