                "body": "Gold prices pulled back from record highs as profit-taking, a stronger U.S. dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, and mixed U.S. economic data created a range-bound environment.\nGold (XAUUSD) prices slipped from fresh record levels of $4,550 to establish new support for 2026. This decrease is because profit is taking place after a good run in 2025. The rebound in the US dollar is also weighing in on gold which limits gains even with supportive macro conditions.\nIn addition, geopolitical uncertainty is another factor supporting wider margin for caution in the markets. The increasing tension between the U.S. and Venezuela as well as new statements issued by President Trump regarding Greenland and Russian oil sanctions are adding to the risks across the board. Trump\u2019s plan to make money from Venezuelan oil is a sign of new stage of geopolitical leverage.\nOn the other hand, economic data from the U.S. is sending mixed signals. The chart below illustrates that the ISM Services PMI rose to a 14 month high of 54.4. This is well above the 52.3 forecast.\nMoreover, the ADP Employment report revealed only 41K new jobs in December missing the mark and barely overcoming a disappointment in a prior reduction.\nMeanwhile, job openings fell sharply to 7.146 million. That is well below the 7.6 million forecast. This confusion could keep the Fed from making aggressive rate cuts in the near term.\nThe market is awaiting the announcement of Nonfarm Payrolls that might make a drastic change on the policy expectations of the Fed. The rate cuts are still expected to be made following the sluggishness in the labour market. However, robust activity in the services aspect could put the Fed process at a slow pace. This uncertainty provides the gold market with a mixed touch which is supported by the macro and central bank policy risks.\nThe daily chart for spot gold shows short-term price fluctuations above the strong support at $4,360 level. The price is again approaching the $4,360 level and a breakout will indicate further downside toward the $4,250 level. Moreover, a break below $4,250 will indicate further downside toward the $4,000 area.\nHowever, the respect of $4,360 will indicate a buildup of positive energy to break above $4,550. A breakout above $4,550 will initiate a strong move to the upside toward $5,000 level.\nThe 4-hour chart for spot gold shows strong price fluctuations above the strong support of the red highlighted region. This consolidation indicates a buildup of positive energy. However, this positive price action will likely remain valid until a break of the $4,260 level. A break below $4,260 will indicate negative price development in the short term.\nThe daily chart for spot silver (XAG) shows the buildup of a topping pattern at the $84 area, as the price is exhausted in the short term. The price is forming a double top pattern with a neckline at the $70 area. A break below $70 will confirm the double top pattern and indicate further downside towards the $60 to $65 level support.\nAs long as the $60 support holds, the next move in the silver market will likely be higher towards the $100 area. A break below the $60 area will take silver prices towards the rising black trendline around $50 area, which serves as the long-term support for 2026.\nThe ascending broadening wedge pattern is also observed on the 4-hour chart. The price is consolidating below the $84 area that serves as the topping pattern. A break above $84 is required to negate this bearish development and indicate further upside towards the $100 area. However, a break below $70 in the spot silver market will confirm the double top pattern and indicate a downside move towards the $65 to $60 area.\nIf silver fails to break below $70 and consolidates above this level, it will increase the possibility of upside breakout.\nThe negative price action in spot silver and spot gold has emerged due to the rebound in the U.S. Dollar Index, as seen in the daily chart below. The index is now "

Economic data in the US has improved the outlook of the labor market ahead of the release of the crucial December Nonfarm Payrolls report. XAU/USD trades at $4,455, virtually unchanged.\nBullion steadies ahead of US Nonfarm Payrolls on firmer labor data, strong US Dollar\nThe US Dollar is staging a recovery after US jobs data showed that companies shed half of the people slashed in November. Furthermore, Initial Jobless Claims came below estimates despite jumping compared to the previous week, while a reduction of the US trade deficit was cheered by Dollar bulls.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the Greenback against a basket of six currencies, is up 0.20% to 98.92 after clearing a key technical resistance level seen at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 98.87. However, US Dollar bulls must achieve a daily close above the latter to remain hopeful for a recovery.\nMeanwhile, the New York Fed Survey of Consumers reported that inflation expectations and job perceptions deteriorated in December, according to the poll.\nAll in all, money markets have priced in 56 basis points of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nUS economic docket for January 9\nOn Friday, traders will eye Nonfarm Payrolls figures, which are expected to show the economy added 60K jobs in December, less than November\u2019s 64K. The Unemployment Rate is projected to dip from 4.6% to 4.5%.\nDaily digest market movers: Upbeat US jobs data caps Gold advance\n- US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending January 3 were below estimates of 210K, which came at 208K, above the previous week\u2019s 200K. The report confirmed that the jobs market is improving following the release of the Challenger Job Cuts report in December, which revealed that companies shed 35,553 jobs, nearly half of November\u2019s 71,321.\n- Andy Challenger, the Chief Revenue Officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, wrote that \u201cThe year closed with the fewest announced layoff plans all year. While December is typically slow, this coupled with higher hiring plans, is a positive sign after a year of high job-cutting plans.\u201d\n- The US Goods and Services Trade Balance revealed that the trade deficit narrowed from $48.1 billion to $29.4 billion in October, exceeding estimates of a widening of $-58.9 billion, on a sharp pullback in imports, notably pharmaceuticals.\n- The New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) revealed that households\u2019 inflation expectations rose in the short term and remained unchanged for the medium term. Job finding expectations declined, while expectations of losing a job worsened.\n- Inflation expectations increased in December to 3.4% from 3.2% for one year, and for three and five years were unchanged at 3%.\n- Following the US data releases, the Atlanta Fed GDP Now estimate for the last quarter of 2025 rose from 2.7% to 5.4%.\n- Gold falls as US Treasury yields rise. The US 10-year note yield rises nearly two and a half basis points to 4.173%. US real yields, which correlate inversely with Gold prices, climbed two basis points to 1.903%.\nTechnical analysis: Gold consolidates at around $4,450\nGold price uptrend is intact, but a daily close below Wednesday's daily low of $4,423 could accelerate a test of the $4,400 figure. Bullish momentum continues to fade as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which remains above its neutral line, but is flat.\nFor a bullish continuation, traders need to regain $4,500, which could clear the path to"

                "body": "In 2025, the Middle East solidified its role as the primary stabilizing force in a fragmented global energy system. While international markets faced geopolitical dislocation and divergent transition pathways, the leading Middle Eastern national oil companies (NOCs) adopted a consistent strategy of sustaining hydrocarbon primacy while systematically reducing costs and carbon intensity. More than $100 billion in upstream capital deployment enabled the NOCs to expand crude spare capacity and accelerate gas development, while selective international acquisitions and portfolio realignments extended their global footprints, strengthening access to advantaged resources across multiple basins. Collectively, these dynamics reinforced the region\u2019s role as a critical buffer against market volatility while shaping the structural economics of global supply. Against this backdrop, we discuss six emerging trends from 2025 which are likely to continue shaping the regional energy sector in 2026.\nInvestment architecture: Disciplined expansion\nThe 2025 fiscal year marked a decisive inflection point as regional NOCs reconciled capital discipline with sustained capacity expansion. While Western majors prioritized shareholder returns, Middle Eastern NOCs sanctioned record volumes of long-cycle projects to reinforce structural supply leadership. Approximately $50 billion in conventional projects were sanctioned in 2025, marking three consecutive years of record spending on approvals, alongside unprecedented unconventional gas activity, led by Saudi Aramco\u2019s Jafurah project. This methodical oil and gas expansion across Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Iraq reinforces the Gulf\u2019s role as the world\u2019s primary swing producer and provides a sovereign insurance mechanism against market volatility.\nNatural gas was a central pillar of regional planning in 2025, with the Middle East capturing nearly a quarter of global upstream gas investment, tallying around $40 billion. The planned development is anchored by Qatar\u2019s North Field expansion, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jafurah, UAE\u2019s drive for gas self-sufficiency, and Iraq\u2019s flared-gas capturing efforts. This regional pivot to gas serves a dual imperative: meeting rapidly rising domestic power demand from industrial growth and data infrastructure, while displacing liquid fuels to preserve higher-value crude exports.\nLooking ahead to 2026, overall investment is set to grow by 10% to about $110 billion as several megaprojects move from final investment decision (FID) to execution. Competition will grow for EPC capacity, liquefied natural gas modules, subsea kit, and skilled labor, driving up cost and schedule risk. Domestic pricing reform and subsidy rationalization will be crucial to unlocking gas?for?power switching at scale and to free crude for export while meeting emerging climate constraints. Lastly, OPEC+ production policy decisions will define crude market dynamics and regional revenue stability ? and by extension, upstream capital outlay or tightening.\nOPEC+ management: From cuts to controlled optionality\nThroughout 2025, OPEC+ successfully transitioned from reactive production cuts to a sophisticated strategy of controlled optionality. This shift reflected an effort to reclaim market share from the Americas ? specifically, the US, Brazil, Guyana, and Canada ? while defending a critical price floor. By December 2025, the alliance had implemented a modest production increase of 137,000 barrels per day, to be followed by a pause in the first quarter of 2026, allowing the group to monetize capacity buffers when fundamentals were favorable while retaining flexibility for seasonal demand lulls. The maneuver signaled that OPEC+ had moved beyond simple volume management to using its massive spare capacity as a tool for economic leverage and market share diplomacy.\nThe primary factor to watch for in 2026 is a projected liquids surplus of over 3 million bpd, which could force the group to choose between defending a price floo"

                "body": "As winter settles in across the Northeast, the U.S. Coast Guard has launched Operation Reliable Energy for Northeast Winters (RENEW) 2026, its annual mission aimed at keeping heating oil flowing to more than 33 million residents during the region\u2019s coldest months.\nNow in its second decade, Operation RENEW reflects a hard reality: the Northeast accounts for roughly 85 percent of the nation\u2019s heating oil consumption, with about 90 percent of that fuel moving through waterways maintained by the Coast Guard. When ice builds up on rivers, bays, and harbors, the region\u2019s energy security depends on the service\u2019s ability to keep those routes open.\n\u201cOperation RENEW 2026 is about keeping Northeast communities safe during the toughest winter months,\u201d said Rear Adm. Michael E. Platt, commander of the Coast Guard\u2019s Northeast District. \u201cOur crews, cutters, and aircraft are ready to respond so heating fuel, food, and medical supplies can continue moving even when ice threatens navigation.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s operation comes as several Coast Guard assets remain in maintenance or upgrade cycles, forcing commanders to concentrate icebreaking and response capabilities where they are needed most. The Coast Guard has designated maintaining heating oil deliveries as its top winter priority.\nThe region\u2019s dependence on oil heat is supported by a fragile supply chain. Most heating oil is refined along the Gulf Coast and shipped more than 5,000 miles north through the Colonial Pipeline to terminals in New Jersey and New York Harbor. From there, a limited number of U.S.-flagged tankers operating under the Jones Act move fuel into New England.\nWhen pipeline flows or domestic coastal shipping fall short, the Northeast is often forced to rely on imports from Canada or even Europe, leaving the region exposed to winter weather, shipping constraints, and volatility in global diesel markets.\nFirst launched during the 2014\u201315 winter season, Operation RENEW has become a fixture of the Coast Guard\u2019s cold-weather operations. As the 2026 mission unfolds, the service says it will continue adjusting its posture to ensure the Northeast\u2019s maritime energy lifeline remains open when it matters most."

It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under "

                "body": "Asia stocks tepid ahead of key US jobs data; China CPI hits 3-yr high\nThe euro\u2019s latest price action underscores a familiar dynamic in global FX markets, where U.S. fundamentals continue to dominate cross-currency moves even when domestic European data appear supportive. Eurozone inflation easing to 2.0% in December confirmed that price pressures are converging toward the European Central Bank\u2019s target, yet the single currency barely reacted. EUR/USD remained essentially unchanged around 1.1673, signaling that markets are no longer trading marginal improvements in euro area data, but instead are calibrating positions around U.S. macro momentum and interest rate expectations.\nThis muted response reflects a clear hierarchy of drivers. With inflation cooling and growth uneven across the bloc, investors broadly expect the ECB to keep policy rates unchanged for now, limiting the euro\u2019s ability to reprice on European news alone. As a result, euro valuation has become increasingly derivative of the dollar leg. When the ECB is perceived as sidelined, relative yield dynamics and global risk positioning hinge almost entirely on the U.S. outlook, leaving EUR/USD sensitive to shifts in American labor market data rather than domestic eurozone releases.\nThat sensitivity is now front and center. U.S. weekly jobless claims due at 13:30 GMT and the upcoming nonfarm payrolls report are the next immediate catalysts for the pair. Strong U.S. labor data would reinforce the dollar\u2019s resilience by pushing back expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve easing, keeping EUR/USD capped despite stable European fundamentals. Conversely, softer employment signals could weaken the dollar and allow the euro to drift higher, even without fresh support from eurozone data.\nFor investors, the implication is a near-term range trading environment rather than a directional euro story driven by Europe itself. The base case is continued consolidation around current levels as long as U.S. data remain mixed and ECB policy expectations stay anchored. The key risk scenario is a decisive surprise in U.S. labor indicators, which could quickly break that range by forcing a repricing of Fed rate expectations and, by extension, the dollar side of the equation. In the absence of such a shock, the euro is likely to remain a passenger to U.S. macro trends rather than a currency setting its own course.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "The US dollar continued to gain ground today, helped along by a stronger than expected jobless claims data. All eyes will be on the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which could set the tone in the FX space for the week ahead. Should US data turn out to be stronger than expected, then the greenback could make back more ground, especially against currencies where the central bank has more policy loosening to do, such as the pound. The GBP/USD forecast could turn modestly bearish in the event NFP turns out to be stronger than expected. I expect the BoE to cut rates sooner than expected by markets \u2013 in March instead of April.\nUS dollar extends recovery ahead of payrolls report\nRecent US data has been all over the place so far this week, ultimately failing to give the dollar a strong sense of direction following the Venezuelan headlines from earlier this week. While jobless claims came in better than expected today at 208K, and ADP employment came in broadly in line with expectations at 41K, November\u2019s job openings data was notably soft and went some way towards offsetting the upbeat ISM services print. Openings fell to a more than one-year low, while hiring slowed, underlining that most employers remain cautious about making meaningful changes to headcount. Overall, this week\u2019s employment indicators reinforce the view that Friday\u2019s jobs report won\u2019t be weak enough to justify additional Fed easing just yet. That, in turn, may help to keep the dollar mildly supported in the near-term outlook.\nWhat has also stood out this week is how well the dollar has held up despite falling oil prices, with commodity markets appearing to take Trump\u2019s plans around Venezuelan supply seriously. Today, though, oil prices bounced back. I suppose oil may only become an issue should WTI break the $55 handle. If so, that could cap the gains for the dollar.\nGBP/USD forecast: Pound likely to remain under mild pressure\nFor the pound, it is all about what the Bank of England is going to do next. Recent data here is increasingly pointing towards further rate cuts, but the Monetary Policy Committee remains cautious and deeply divided. While February looks too soon for another move, the balance of evidence suggests a cut in March, followed by another in June. One particular area of concern for the MPC hawks is employment, where vacancies have fallen sharply and are now below pre-pandemic levels, while redundancies appear to be rising. This matters because wage growth is slowing rapidly. Private sector pay growth has fallen from around 6% earlier last year to just under 4% by autumn. As a result, inflation could fall back quicker. As food prices and rents both cool, services inflation should weaken as well, further supporting the case for more rate cuts. Let\u2019s not forget about base effects from last year\u2019s tax hikes, which to will also push inflation lower from April onwards. Combined with falling energy prices, headline inflation should drop to around 2% from April and stay close to that level through the rest of the year.\nWhile markets now see April as the most likely timing, I would argue March is more probable for the next cut. By then, the MPC will have several more wage and labour market reports, which should provide reassurance that inflation pressures are indeed easing. February, though, might come too soon.\nGBP/USD forecast: technical analysis and key levels to watch\nThe GBPUSD chart continues to print higher highs and higher lows, so the trend is yet to reverse completely despite the reversal from the 1.35 handle over the past few days. With bullish momentum starting to fade, and the absence of strong upside follow-through suggests bullish conviction may be weakening. This is especially the case as price has recently pushed into a long-term resistance band spanning roughly 1.35 to 1.40 area.\nIt\u2019s still premature to call a major top, but failure to hold above the 1.35 handle may be a sign for concern.

Market participants appear hesitant, choosing to wait on the sidelines until the release of the much-anticipated US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report later today before making new directional moves.\nThe upcoming US employment figures are expected to shed more light on the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate adjustments. These insights will likely have a significant impact on the short-term trajectory of the US Dollar and, consequently, the GBP/USD exchange rate. As investors brace for this key data, expectations for further monetary easing by the Fed, combined with steady equity markets, are preventing the US Dollar from extending its recent rally to a one-month high, thereby supporting the GBP/USD pair.\nAdditionally, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) recent communication, which was less dovish and indicated that interest rates may be nearing a neutral stance, continues to provide support for the British Pound (GBP). This could help limit further losses for the GBP/USD pair. As a result, it may be wise to wait for a decisive move lower before anticipating an extended pullback from the 1.3565-1.3570 area\u2014the highest level seen since September 18, reached earlier this week according to the economic calendar.\nCurrently, the pair looks set to finish the week with little overall change. Despite this, the prevailing market fundamentals seem to favor buyers, suggesting that any dips could attract renewed interest. From a technical standpoint, a clear and sustained drop below the 1.3400 psychological level would be required to confirm further downside for GBP/USD, signaling that bearish traders should proceed with caution."

Traders now seem reluctant and opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the highly anticipated US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report later today, before placing fresh directional bets.\nThe crucial US employment details would provide more cues about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path, which, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term US Dollar (USD) price dynamics and drive the GBP/USD pair. Heading into the key data risk, rising bets for further policy easing by the Fed, along with a stable performance around the equity markets, keep a lid on the recent USD move higher to a one-month peak and act as a tailwind for the currency pair.\nMoreover, the Bank of England's (BoE) less dovish message, suggesting that interest rates are getting closer to neutral, might continue to act as a tailwind for the British Pound (GBP) and further help limit the downside for the GBP/USD pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for an extension of the pair's retracement slide from the 1.3565-1.3570 region, or the highest level since September 18, touched during the first of this week.\nAt current levels, spot prices remain on track to end the week on a flattish note. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop, however, seems tilted in favor of bullish traders and backs the case for the emergence of some dip-buying at lower levels. Even from a technical perspective, a sustained break and acceptance below the 1.3400 round-figure mark is needed to back the case for any further depreciating move for the GBP/USD pair, warranting some caution for aggressive bears.\nEconomic Indicator\nNonfarm Payrolls\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls release presents the number of new jobs created in the US during the previous month in all non-agricultural businesses; it is released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile. The number is also subject to strong reviews, which can also trigger volatility in the Forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish, although previous months' reviews and the Unemployment Rate are as relevant as the headline figure. The market's reaction, therefore, depends on how the market assesses all the data contained in the BLS report as a whole.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Jan 09, 2026 13:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 60K\nPrevious: 64K\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nAmerica\u2019s monthly jobs report is considered the most important economic indicator for forex traders. Released on the first Friday following the reported month, the change in the number of positions is closely correlated with the overall performance of the economy and is monitored by policymakers. Full employment is one of the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandates and it considers developments in the labor market when setting its policies, thus impacting currencies. Despite several leading indicators shaping estimates, Nonfarm Payrolls tend to surprise markets and trigger substantial volatility. Actual figures beating the consensus tend to be USD bullish.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

The shift in tone came after a softer inflation print, which sparked a rally in Australian government bonds and knocked the market\u2019s implied odds of a February hike down to about 28%. That re..\npricing pulled 10-year yields to around 4.66% and kept the Australia\u2013US yield gap stuck near 65 basis points, limiting any extra lift versus the greenback. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser also called the inflation slowdown \u201chelpful\u201d, but the next key checkpoint is the Jan 28 CPI release.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: FX is following the data again.\nIf Jan 28 CPI reaccelerates, rate expectations could snap back and boost the aussie, especially against lower-yielding currencies. If inflation keeps cooling, falling yields could cap AUD/USD even if the currency stays strong on crosses. Commodity tailwinds still matter \u2013 firmer iron ore, copper, and gold typically support Australia\u2019s export income and, in turn, the currency.\nThe bigger picture: Policy gaps are doing the heavy lifting.\nCurrency moves are increasingly about central banks drifting apart. Australia\u2019s path is being compared directly with New Zealand\u2019s, where investors expect rates to stay on hold for months, helping push AUD/NZD to a 12-year high.

Although there is potential for a dip to the 0.66 level in the short term due to recalibrated rate hike speculation, a 12-month outlook predicts a rise to 0.69.\nLooking back to early last year, the Australian dollar was the top performer among G10 currencies. This strength was built on the idea that the Reserve Bank of Australia would be the first major central bank to raise interest rates. However, comments from officials at the time correctly hinted at a more patient approach.\nThat cautious stance from the RBA proved to be the right call, as we saw them hold the cash rate steady at 4.35% throughout all of 2025. This was contrary to early market pricing which had anticipated at least one rate hike. The persistent inflation, which ended the third quarter last year at 3.6%, justified the central bank\u2019s decision to remain on hold rather than cutting rates like some others began to discuss.\nFuture Outlook for AUD USD\nThe forecast for price action last year was also quite accurate, as we saw the AUD/USD dip toward the 0.66 level mid-year. This occurred as markets adjusted their aggressive rate hike expectations for the RBA. The currency then recovered in the latter half of the year, trading up toward the 0.6850 mark, very close to the 0.69 target.\nAs we move forward into January 2026, the key focus remains on the relative policy between the RBA and the US Federal Reserve. With Australian inflation still above target, the market is not pricing in any RBA rate cuts until at least the second half of this year. This contrasts with expectations for the Fed, which is seen as having more room to ease policy sooner.\nFor traders, this suggests positioning for potential strength in the AUD/USD while managing risk. Buying call options with strike prices around 0.6900 and 0.6950 for the coming months could be a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a potential rally. This strategy allows participation in the upside if strong Australian economic data forces the RBA to maintain its firm stance."

The AUD/USD pair remains subdued following the release of key economic data from China, a key trading partner of Australia.\nChina\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.8% year-over-year (YoY) in December, up from 0.7% in November but below the 0.9% forecast. On a monthly basis, CPI increased 0.2%, reversing November\u2019s -0.1% reading. Meanwhile, China\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 1.9% YoY in December, improving from a 2.2% decline previously and slightly beating expectations of a -2.0% print.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Thursday that Australia\u2019s Trade Surplus narrowed to 2,936M MoM in November, versus 4,353M (revised from 4,385M) in the previous reading. Exports fell by 2.9% MoM in November from a rise of 2.8% (revised from 3.4%) seen a month earlier. Meanwhile, Imports grew by 0.2% MoM in November, compared to a rise of 2.4% (revised from 2.0%) seen in October.\nAustralia\u2019s mixed November Consumer Price Index (CPI) left the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) policy outlook uncertain. Focus now shifts to the quarterly CPI report due later this month for clearer guidance on the RBA\u2019s next policy move. However, RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said on Thursday that the November inflation data was largely as expected. Hauser added that interest rate cuts are unlikely anytime soon.\nUS Dollar gains amid solid labor market data\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is gaining ground and trading around 98.90 at the time of writing. The Greenback strengthens following the release of US weekly labor market data.\n- Traders remain cautious ahead of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to offer further insight into labor market conditions and the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy outlook. December NFP is forecast to show job gains of 60,000, down from 64,000 in November.\n- US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNBC interview on Thursday that the Federal Reserve should continue cutting rates, arguing that lower rates are \u201cthe only ingredient missing\u201d for even stronger economic growth and that the Fed should not delay.\n- According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, Fed funds futures continue to price in about an 86.2% probability that the US central bank will keep rates unchanged at its January 27\u201328 meeting.\n- The US Department of Labor (DOL) reported on Thursday that Initial Jobless Claims rose modestly to 208,000 in the week ended January 3, slightly below market expectations of 210,000 but above the previous week\u2019s revised 200,000. Continuing jobless claims increased to 1.914 million from 1.858 million, indicating a gradual rise in the number of people remaining on unemployment benefits.\n- The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported on Wednesday that the US Services PMI rose to 54.4 in December from 52.6 in November. This figure came in stronger than the expectations of 52.3.\n- The US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change showed an increase of 41,000 jobs in December, following a revised decline of 29,000 in November. The figure came in slightly below market expectations of 47,000. JOLTS Job Openings came in at 7.146 million in November. This reading followed the 7.449 million openings recorded in October (revised from 7.67 million) and came in below the market expectations of 7.6 million.\n- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday that Australia\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose 3.4% y"

Worries that consumption momentum could fade if inflation continues to outpace wage growth in early 2026 overshadow an unexpected rise in Japan's Household Spending data for November. This, in turn, adds to the uncertainty over the timing of the next Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike and undermines the JPY amid an escalating China-Japan row.\nApart from this, concerns about Japan's fiscal situation and a stable performance across equity markets further weigh on the safe-haven JPY. The USD, on the other hand, prolongs a two-week-old uptrend and touches a one-month top amid some repositioning ahead of the crucial US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, providing an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. However, bets for more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which marks a significant divergence in comparison to hawkish BoJ expectations, could cap the USD and lend support to the lower-yielding JPY.\nJapanese Yen selling remains unabated amid BoJ rate hike doubts, China-Japan tensions\n- The Statistics Bureau of Japan reported earlier this Friday that Household Spending rebounded following a sharp decline in October and unexpectedly rose 2.9% from a year earlier in November. The upbeat data, however, does little to provide any respite to the Japanese Yen amid persistent real wage weakness.\n- In fact, government data showed on Thursday that Japan's inflation-adjusted real wages fell for the 11th consecutive month, by 2.8% in November, suggesting that the underlying trend of inflation outpacing wage growth has not changed. This poses a challenge for the Bank of Japan and undermines the JPY.\n- Furthermore, China escalated its dispute with Japan and has begun restricting exports of rare earths and rare-earth magnets to Japan. This ban follows the recent Taiwan-related remarks by Japan\u2019s Prime Minister and heightens supply-chain risk for Japanese manufacturers, which further weighs on the JPY.\n- BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda left the door open for further policy tightening, reiterating earlier this week that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if economic and price developments move in line with forecasts. This, along with rising geopolitical tensions, could lend support to the safe-haven JPY.\n- The US Dollar, on the other hand, preserves its gains registered over the past two weeks and stands firm near a one-month top, providing an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. The upside for the USD, however, seems limited amid dovish US Federal Reserve expectations and ahead of the US employment details.\n- Traders have been pricing in the possibility that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in March and deliver another interest rate cut by the end of this year. Traders, however, opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. Hence, the focus remains on the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls report.\nUSD/JPY could accelerate the momentum above the 157.30 area, or the weekly high\nThe 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart is gently rising at 156.31, pointing to sustained upward bias. The USD/JPY pair holds above this gauge, with the average acting as immediate dynamic support. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line stands above the Signal line and back in positive territory, with a modestly expanding histogram that reinforces improving momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62 shows firm buying pressure without overbought conditions."

                "body": "On Friday, January 9, Japanese household spending surged in November, fueling speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike, spotlighting USD/JPY.\nThe household spending figures contrasted sharply with wage growth data for November, which suggested a potential pullback in consumption at the end of the year. The conflicting reports left the USD/JPY pair around the 157 level and, crucially, the Japanese government\u2019s yen intervention zone (157-160).\nThe sharp rise in household spending had a muted effect on 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields, underscoring the significance of the weaker wage data. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bearish for USD/JPY, given the prospects of Fed rate cuts and eventual BoJ rate hikes.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nJapanese household spending jumped 6.2% month-on-month in November, recovering from October\u2019s 3.5% decline. Year-on-year, household spending increased 2.9% compared with a 3.0% drop in October.\nNovember\u2019s spending data will give the BoJ hawks a firmer footing to push for a higher neutral interest rate and rate hikes. Robust consumer spending would fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more restrictive monetary policy stance. Furthermore, private consumption accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP growth.\nGiven the Bank of Japan\u2019s focus on the economic momentum and prices, the November household spending figures support a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. This week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled further rate hikes if prices and the economy aligned with the Bank\u2019s projections.\nIn contrast, November\u2019s wage growth figures suggested the need for caution against monetary policy tightening in Q1 2026. Average cash earnings rose 0.5% YoY in November, down sharply from October\u2019s 2.5% increase, while overtime pay increased 1.2% YoY (October: 2.1%).\nTypically, softer wage growth, coupled with a weak yen, weakens households\u2019 purchasing power, curbing consumption. A pullback in consumer spending would cool demand-driven inflation and signal a loss of economic momentum, supporting a less hawkish BoJ rate path.\nThe USD/JPY trends reflected the greater influence of the wage growth data on expectations of a BoJ rate hike. The USD/JPY pair was up 0.05% to 156.907 in early trading on Friday, January 9. Despite the mixed numbers for November, economists expect wages to rebound in December, supporting the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nEast Asia Econ commented on recent Japanese economic data, including November\u2019s wage growth data, stating:\n\u201cThe BoJ\u2019s quarterly regional Sakura report shows conditions holding up, and the dip in consumer confidence in December isn\u2019t concerning, given the post-March bounce. Wage growth in November was mixed, but can be expected to rebound in December on stronger bonuses.\u201d\nLater on Friday, the highly anticipated US jobs report will influence expectations of a March Fed rate cut. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to increase 60k in December after rising 64k in November, while forecasting unemployment to fall from 4.6% to 4.5% in December. Furthermore, economists forecast average hourly earnings to increase 3.6% YoY in December, up from 3.5% in November.\nWeaker-than-expected labor market data would raise bets on a March Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed rate path would weigh on demand for the US dollar, sending USD/JPY lower.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut fell from 43.2% on January 7 to 41.6% on January 8. Stronger-than-expected US Services PMI data tempered expectations of a March cut. The ISM Services PMI increased from 52.6 in November to 54.4 in December, signaling a robust US economy.\nToday\u2019s US jobs report will be key for the near-term USD/JPY price outlook. Fading bets on a March Fed rate cut would challenge the bearish short-term outlook and send USD/JPY higher.\nHowever, expectations of BoJ rate hikes, a new F"

                "body": "At a glance:\nFar above expectations for a decline\nMonthly spending jumped 6.2% m/m\nBOJ recently lifted rates to 30-year high\nReal wages still falling sharply\nJapanese household spending unexpectedly rebounded in November, offering a tentative sign of resilience in domestic demand even as real income pressures persist and the central bank tightens policy.\nData from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed household spending rose 2.9% year-on-year, sharply beating market expectations for a 0.9% decline and reversing October\u2019s steep contraction. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, spending surged 6.2%, more than double the consensus forecast of a 2.7% increase, pointing to a strong sequential recovery.\nThe upside surprise comes shortly after the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate last month to 0.75% from 0.5%, the highest level in three decades. The move reflected confidence that wage growth would remain sufficiently firm to support consumption and sustain progress toward stable inflation. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has reiterated that the central bank is prepared to continue lifting borrowing costs if economic activity and price developments evolve broadly in line with its projections, underscoring the bank\u2019s gradual shift away from ultra-easy monetary policy.\nHowever, beneath the headline strength in spending, real income dynamics remain a constraint. Separate data released by the labour ministry showed inflation-adjusted real wages fell 2.8% year-on-year in November, extending a run of declines and highlighting the continued erosion of household purchasing power.\nThe divergence between nominal spending gains and falling real wages suggests households may be drawing on savings or adjusting consumption timing, rather than benefiting from a sustained improvement in income growth. As a result, economists remain cautious about extrapolating November\u2019s rebound into a durable consumption trend.\nFor policymakers, the data complicates the outlook. Stronger spending supports the case that the economy can withstand higher interest rates, but persistent real wage weakness underscores the risk that consumption momentum could fade if inflation continues to outpace pay growth in early 2026."

At the time of writing, USD/CAD trades around 1.3875, hovering near its highest level since December 5.\nHowever, the pair lacks strong follow-through buying as a rebound in Oil prices lends some support to the Loonie, given Canada\u2019s status as a major crude exporter. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades around $57.22, up nearly 1.78% after coming under pressure earlier this week amid market reaction to recent US military action in Venezuela and expanding US oversight of Venezuelan Oil exports.\nThe US Dollar extends its advance after data released earlier in the day showed Initial Jobless Claims rose modestly to 208,000 in the week ended January 3, slightly below market expectations of 210,000 and up from the previous week\u2019s revised reading of 200,000.\nContinuing Jobless Claims increased to 1.914 million from 1.858 million, while the four-week moving average of Initial Claims eased to 211,750 from 219,000.\nThe main highlight came from trade data. Figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Census Bureau showed the Goods and Services Trade deficit narrowed sharply to $29.4 billion in October, well below forecasts of $58.9 billion and down from September\u2019s revised $48.1 billion shortfall.\nTraders now look ahead to Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. Economists forecast payrolls to rise by 60,000 in January, following a 64,000 increase in the prior month. A softer-than-expected reading would likely reinforce expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) easing, while a stronger print could temper rate-cut bets. Markets are currently pricing in around two Fed rate cuts this year.\nIn Canada, the economic calendar remains relatively light. Data released earlier showed Canada\u2019s trade balance swung to a deficit of C$0.58 billion in October from a C$0.24 billion surplus in September, though the shortfall was smaller than market expectations for a C$1.4 billion deficit.\nAttention now turns to Friday\u2019s Canadian labour-market report. Net Change in Employment is forecast to show a modest decline of 5,000 jobs in December, following a strong 53,600 increase in November.\nOn the monetary policy front, markets widely expect the Bank of Canada (BoC) to keep interest rates unchanged through much of 2026.\nBank of Canada FAQs\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC), based in Ottawa, is the institution that sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Canada. It does so at eight scheduled meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings that are held as required. The BoC primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at between 1-3%. Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Canadian Dollar (CAD) and vice versa. Other tools used include quantitative easing and tightening.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of Canada can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the BoC prints Canadian Dollars for the purpose of buying assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker CAD. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The Bank of Canada used the measure during the Great Financial Crisis of 2009-11 when credit froze after banks lost faith in each other\u2019s ability to repay debts.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE.

In a new analysis, Howard Du, CFA at BofA, suggests that after a tumultuous year defined by trade anxiety and shifting labor dynamics, the USD/CAD pair has reached a point of equilibrium.\nThe \"persistently positive economic data surprise\" out of Canada has finally acted as a catalyst to \"crack\" short CAD speculative positioning, Du noted. This reversal follows a third consecutive month of resilient labor data, which effectively dismantled the bearish narrative that had pushed the loonie to a November low of 1.41.\nAccording to BofA\u2019s valuation models, the Canadian dollar is no longer considered \"cheap.\" The pair\u2019s rapid descent to 1.36 in December represents a return to what the bank defines as fair value.\nWhile the market has pivoted toward optimism, BofA remains skeptical of the more aggressive hawkish bets now appearing in the rates market. \"We believe the rates market is premature to price-in a full Bank of Canada (BoC) rate hike for 2026,\" Du wrote. \"Inflation upside risk is elusive in Canada.\"\nBofA\u2019s analysis suggests the recent growth spurts are not a sign of an \"overheating\" economy. Instead, the data indicates Canada is simply on track to close its negative output gap, a process that absorbs excess supply without necessarily triggering the inflationary pressures required for further rate hikes.\nLooking into the coming year, Bank of America maintains a \"neutral\" stance for the near term, forecasting that USD/CAD will hover around 1.38 through the first half of 2026.\nThe bank\u2019s analysis highlights two conflicting forces:\n-\nDownside Pressure: A broad-based sell-off of the U.S. dollar could continue to drag the pair lower.\n-\nUpside Resistance: As the market gradually \"prices out\" the expectation of a BoC rate hike, the Canadian dollar is expected to lose some of its recent luster.\nBofA views the trajectory of the loonie in 2026 as \"backloaded.\" The bank anticipates a second wave of appreciation for the Canadian dollar, sending USD/CAD back toward 1.36, only after the USMCA renegotiation process reaches its culmination.\nUntil that trade uncertainty is cleared from the horizon, Du and his team expect the pair to remain range-bound, resisting further significant gains despite the strong economic finish to 2025.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

The bank\u2019s research team cited multiple converging factors that have brought the currency pair to what they term \u201cequilibrium valuation.\u201d This shift represents more than just a tactical adjustment; it signals a fundamental reassessment of the economic relationship between the United States and Canada.\nCurrency analysts at the institution highlighted several key metrics supporting their revised position. The Canadian dollar, commonly called the loonie, has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout early 2025. Meanwhile, the US dollar has shown moderated strength following Federal Reserve policy adjustments. These parallel developments have created what Bank of America describes as \u201cbalanced valuation conditions\u201d for the currency pair.\nQuantitative Fair Value Assessment\nThe bank\u2019s quantitative models incorporate numerous variables to determine fair value. These include purchasing power parity calculations, interest rate differentials, commodity price impacts, and relative economic growth projections. According to their latest analysis, the USD/CAD exchange rate now falls within their defined fair value range of 1.28 to 1.32. This range represents a significant narrowing from previous quarters, indicating reduced currency misalignment between the two North American economies.\nHistorical context provides important perspective for this development. The USD/CAD pair has experienced substantial volatility over the past decade, with dramatic swings driven by oil price fluctuations, divergent monetary policies, and shifting trade dynamics. Bank of America\u2019s current neutral stance contrasts sharply with their previous positions during periods of significant currency misalignment.\nCanadian Dollar Analysis: The Loonie\u2019s Journey to Fair Value\nThe Canadian dollar\u2019s path to fair value represents a complex narrative of economic adaptation and policy response. Several interconnected factors have contributed to this equilibrium achievement. First, Canada\u2019s economic diversification efforts have shown measurable success, reducing the currency\u2019s historical dependence on crude oil prices. Second, the Bank of Canada\u2019s calibrated monetary policy has maintained stability without creating excessive divergence from US interest rate trajectories.\nKey economic indicators supporting the loonie\u2019s current valuation include:\n- Trade Balance Improvement: Canada\u2019s non-energy exports have grown consistently for six consecutive quarters\n- Inflation Convergence: Canadian and US inflation rates now differ by less than 0.5 percentage points\n- Employment Stability: Both countries maintain unemployment rates within 1% of each other\n- Fiscal Position: Relative government debt levels have stabilized after pandemic-era divergence\nCommodity markets continue influencing the Canadian dollar, but their impact has become more nuanced. While crude oil prices remain important, other resource sectors\u2014including agriculture, minerals, and renewable energy components\u2014now contribute more significantly to Canada\u2019s export profile. This diversification has reduced the currency\u2019s volatility relative to energy price movements.\nMonetary Policy Alignment\nThe Bank of Canada and Federal Reserve have maintained remarkably synchronized policy approaches throughout 2024 and early 2025. Both central banks have adopted similar pac"

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair remains under pressure below the 211.00 mark due to rising demand for the Japanese Yen (JPY) as a safe haven. This comes amidst the backdrop of uncertainties over the timing of the next Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike and heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the US military engagements in Latin America and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nDespite a brief uptick during the Asian session, the GBP/JPY pair finds it challenging to maintain momentum, holding near its daily lows. Yet, selling pressure is limited, indicating hesitance among traders to position for a further pullback from recent highs achieved earlier this week.\nGeopolitical Instabilities And The Yen\nGeopolitical instabilities continue to encourage support for JPY, seen as a stable option in turbulent times. Economic indicators, like Japan\u2019s real wage data, contribute to the cautious trading environment. Although Japan\u2019s wages fell significantly, the BoJ\u2019s potential policy changes underpin the strength of the Yen, adding headwinds for the currency pair.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England\u2019s stance remains less dovish, suggesting potential support for the British Pound (GBP). With no significant UK economic indicators expected soon, the market focuses on JPY movements, revealing JPY as the strongest against the Australian Dollar today. The heatmap visualises currency fluctuations, confirming the Yen\u2019s resilience.\nThe GBP/JPY is stuck below 211.00 as we begin 2026, caught between opposing forces. Looking back at late 2025, geopolitical flare-ups involving the US in Latin America and the Arctic are providing a tailwind for the safe-haven yen. This creates a difficult environment for those expecting a simple continuation of the uptrend.\nWe see that speculation about another Bank of Japan rate hike is a major factor, a theme that began after they finally ended negative interest rates back in March 2024. However, the report from November 2025 showing Japanese real wages falling at their fastest pace in nearly a year complicates the timing for their next move. This uncertainty is likely why yen bulls are hesitating to push the cross significantly lower.\nBritish Pound And Bank Of England Influence\nOn the other side of the trade, the British Pound finds support from a fairly resolute Bank of England. With UK core inflation data from the last quarter of 2025 holding stubbornly above 3%, the BoE is in no rush to cut rates. This keeps the interest rate difference between the UK and Japan wide, putting a floor under the GBP/JPY for now.\nGiven this deadlock, we believe the best approach in the coming weeks is to trade the expected volatility rather than the direction itself. The high level of uncertainty makes buying options, such as a straddle, an attractive strategy to profit from a large price swing in either direction. One-month implied volatility for GBP/JPY has already climbed above 10%, reflecting this tension in the market.\nFor traders who feel the rally has run its course, the peak of 212.15 from last year now serves as a formidable resistance level. A strategy could involve selling out-of-the-money call options or implementing a bear call spread to capitalize on the idea that the pair\u2019s upside is now capped. This would generate income while defining risk if the pair unexpectedly breaks higher."

Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling, warranting some caution before positioning for an extension of the recent pullback from the 212.15 region, or the highest level since August 2008, touched on Tuesday.\nThe US military attack on Venezuela over the weekend, followed by US President Donald Trump's confrontational rhetoric toward Colombia and Mexico, raised concerns about regional instability in Latin America. Adding to this, the White House said on Tuesday that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including the potential use of the US military. This comes on top of the protracted Russia-Ukraine war and keeps geopolitical risks in play, offering some support to the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY).\nApart from this, the prospect for a further policy tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) underpin the JPY amid intervention fears and turns out to be a key factor acting as a headwind for the GBP/JPY cross. Meanwhile, data released earlier today showed that Japan\u2019s real wages fell in November at the fastest pace since last January. Moreover, investors remain uncertain about the likely timing of the next BoJ rate hike, which might hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets and help limit losses for the currency pair.\nFurthermore, the Bank of England's (BoE) less dovish message, suggesting that rates are getting closer to neutral, might continue to support the British Pound (GBP) and the GBP/JPY cross. This, in turn, makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the currency pair has topped out in the near term and positioning for any meaningful corrective decline. Moving ahead, there isn't any relevant market-moving economic data due for release from the UK, leaving spot prices at the mercy of JPY."

ProCap chief investment officer Jeff Park\nstated that even modest inflows would deliver meaningful benefits across the firm's operations.\nPark explained that the bank is making a calculated bet on intangible advantages that will strengthen its market position. The move signals Morgan Stanley's commitment to monetizing its ETRADE brokerage subsidiary through crypto trading and\ntokenization partnerships.\nThese strategic benefits extend to talent recruitment compared to competitors. Park noted that the crypto market has proven larger than industry professionals anticipated, particularly for reaching new customer segments.\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF filing also provides reputational advantages by positioning Morgan Stanley as forward-thinking and technologically progressive. Park stated that every asset manager recognizes that offering a Bitcoin ETF communicates an edgy, youthful brand identity to clients and prospects.\nMorgan Stanley ranks among the world's three largest investment banks alongside Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. While both competitors maintain crypto investment connections, neither currently offers proprietary crypto\nETFs.\nMorningstar ETF analyst Bryan Armour said that Morgan Stanley likely aims to migrate existing clients with Bitcoin holdings into its own products. This strategy could generate substantial early momentum despite the firm's late market entry.\nArmour added that a major bank entering the crypto ETF space adds legitimacy to the product category. He suggested that other traditional financial institutions may follow Morgan Stanley's lead. The bank's ETRADE platform already provides infrastructure for retail crypto access, which Park identified as a positive externality regardless of ETF performance metrics.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

It surfaces during pauses, when momentum cools, narratives fade, and conviction is quietly tested. That's exactly where markets stand now, with Bitcoin easing after an institutional-led bounce, XRP slipping as risk appetite recalibrates, and the broader landscape taking a measured breath.\nThese resets are when new narratives start to form. While large-cap assets consolidate, attention often drifts toward projects still early in their journey. Among the Best Altcoin Picks gaining traction right now, the Apeing https://www.apeing.com whitelist activity stands out. The buzz isn't loud yet, but it's deliberate, structured, and building fast.\nWhy Timing Matters More Than Charts Right Now\nShort-term price moves grab attention, but structure determines outcomes. When markets cool, the advantage shifts to those who position early rather than react late. This is the phase in which history has shown that those willing to act tend to outperform those waiting for perfect confirmation.\nThat's exactly where Apeing fits in. Instead of chasing momentum, the project is creating it, quietly, methodically, and early.\nApeing's Role Among the Best Altcoin Picks Forming Early\nApeing enters the Best Altcoin Picks discussion with a setup built for early conviction. The Apeing https://www.apeing.com whitelist offers Stage 1 pricing at 0.0001, with a planned listing price of 0.001. Only a limited number of tokens are allocated to this first phase, creating scarcity by design.\nThis structure builds trust by eliminating surprises. Pricing is clear. Supply is controlled. Expectations are set from day one. That clarity opens the door to growth opportunities that often disappear once broader attention arrives. $APEING isn't positioned as a late-stage momentum chase, it's structured as an early entry opportunity.\nDon't Miss This Golden Chance Again in Best Altcoin Picks\nMissing early access to the Best Altcoin Picks category usually feels harmless at first. Then price discovery begins, and hesitation turns expensive. The Apeing https://www.apeing.com whitelist locks in the lowest possible entry before demand scales.\nOnce Stage 1 fills, that price is gone permanently. No redraws. No second chances. Don't get left holding the bag by waiting for charts to confirm what structure already signals.\nHow the Apeing Crypto Whitelist Works for Early Movers in Best Altcoin Picks\nThe whitelist acts as a filter, not a free-for-all. Early movers gain access while supply remains constrained. This creates asymmetric setups in which projected ROI scenarios can exceed 10,000%, based on pricing mechanics from the presale to the listing, not guarantees.\nThis is where diamond hands are formed. Apeing and $APEING reward decisiveness during the quiet phase, not reaction during the loud one.\nBitcoin Pulls Back as Institutions Digest ETF Inflows\nBitcoin declined 2.47% to $90,552.14 in the last 24 hours, easing after a strong rebound driven by renewed spot ETF inflows earlier this month. Institutional confidence remains intact, but short-term profit-taking slowed momentum.\nThis matters because Bitcoin's pauses often open space for altcoins to shine. When the market leader consolidates, capital frequently rotates toward higher-upside opportunities. That rotation fuels interest in early-stage contenders within the Best Altcoin Picks, rather than chasing incremental gains in large caps.\nXRP Slides as Traders Lock in Short-Term Gains\nXRP dropped 5.39% to $0.3943, reflecting a broader pullback after a brief rally. The move appears driven by short-term rebalancing rather than structural weakness.\nXRP remains relevant in cross-border payments, but its price action highlights a familiar pattern: established assets often cool after fast moves.

Spikes in queue length can amplify discounts to liquid staking tokens because those who buy them must wait longer until they can redeem them for the underlying Ether they represent.\nA free flowing exit queue is also a good thing for the broader DeFi ecosystem. It\u2019s now simpler and cheaper for those engaged in leveraged Ethereum staking strategies to unwind their positions, leading to more efficient trading, Kutakov said.\nWhy is there a queue?\nEthereum\u2019s exit queue is a necessary part of the blockchain\u2019s security.\nThe mechanism limits the speed at which Ether can leave the network based on the total amount staked. Currently, it\u2019s set to around 57,600 tokens every day.\nThis helps prevent rapid changes to Ethereum\u2019s validator set \u2014 those running the software that stakes Ether and processes transactions on the network. Each validator must lock up at least 32 Ether tokens, up to a maximum of 2,048.\nA sudden drop in validators could make the network more vulnerable to attack. The delay also stops validators exiting immediately should they misbehave, disincentivising abuse.\nThe cleared exit queue also comes as a relief for Rocket Pool, the third largest Ethereum liquid staking protocol which holds $1.8 billion worth of staked Ether.\nRocket Pool\u2019s node operators will have a much easier time redeploying their validators following its upcoming Saturn upgrade planned for February 9, Darren Langley, a general manager at the protocol, told DL News.\nStaking inflows surge\nAs the exit queue rolls off, the queue to spin up new Ethereum validators is also increasing at a rapid pace.\nSince December 24, the amount of Ether tokens entering the queue has jumped almost 300% to more than 1.7 million. New validators entering the queue must now wait over 30 days before they are able to join the network, per data from Beaconcha.in.\nBitMine, the world\u2019s biggest Ethereum treasury firm, is responsible for a large portion of the new Ether being staked. The firm began staking on December 26 and has since locked up 936,512 Ether worth approximately $2.9 billion, per onchain records.\nBitMine chair Tom Lee has repeatedly expressed his intention to purchase and stake 5% of the entire Ether token supply.\nThe firm currently holds just over 4 million Ether, around 67% of the way towards its goal.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Independent researcher Weilin Li said that the exploit likely stemmed from a vulnerability in a mispriced minting function within an old smart contract deployed about five years ago.\nThis allowed attackers to purchase the protocol's native TRU tokens at significantly reduced prices. Two separate attackers were involved, Li said, with one profiting around $26 million, while another gained approximately $250,000.\n\"Old contracts are getting more 'popular' among attackers now,\" Li added.\nFollowing the exploit, the price of Truebit's TRU token plummeted 99.9%, dropping from approximately $0.16 to $0.00007721, according to data from Coingecko. The Block has reached out to Truebit for further comment.\nDeFi security risks\nThis incident adds to the ongoing challenges in DeFi security, with rising risks associated with legacy contracts.\nThe November exploit on Balancer targeted a rounding error in the DeFi protocol's v2 Composable Stable Pools, draining over $120 million in assets across multiple chains. Multiple other protocols, including Bunni, Nemo Protocol, Hyperdrive, and Yearn Finance, recently suffered smart contract exploits.\nLast month, AI research company Anthropic flagged that advanced AI agents identified vulnerabilities in both dated and recently deployed smart contracts on Ethereum, warning that malicious actors now have access to advanced technology to exploit obscure and complex vulnerabilities.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "Recent activity across major networks shows a market that is active but facing clear limits. The Solana price has pushed higher in recent sessions, yet technical readings now point toward overbought conditions, with the $153 level acting as a firm ceiling. At the same time, the XRP price is drawing attention as Ripple-backed efforts expand XRP utility into the Solana ecosystem through partnerships involving Hex Trust and LayerZero. These developments underline a market full of progress, but also one constrained by resistance levels and gradual utility rollout.\nSolana Price Tests Key Levels After Short-Term Strength\nThe Solana price has shown notable short-term movement, with SOL rising close to 6 percent in a single session and trading within the $130 to $140 range. While price remains above short-term moving averages, signaling near-term buying interest, it continues to sit below longer-term indicators such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This positioning suggests caution remains part of the broader trend.\nMomentum signals reflect this balance. The RSI is holding near neutral, showing neither strong buying pressure nor a clear breakdown. Analysts point to firm support around $132 and heavy resistance near $153, leading many to expect continued sideways movement in the near term. While integrations and ecosystem growth support long-range prospects, the Solana price appears limited until it can push decisively above resistance.\nXRP Price Holds Near $2 as Cross-Chain Use Expands\nThe XRP price has softened slightly, trading close to the $2 level even as new cross-chain developments emerge. Wrapped XRP initiatives now allow the asset to operate within networks such as Solana while remaining fully backed by native XRP.\nCurrently near $1.99, the XRP price reflects short-term hesitation, but broader utility is expanding. With more than $100 million in value locked at launch, wrapped XRP is designed to provide liquidity access across lending, trading, and liquidity platforms on multiple chains. Regulated custody and compliance frameworks are also in place, increasing appeal among larger market participants. While near-term price action remains measured, these developments position XRP as a more flexible asset over time.\nFinal Outlook\nRecent market behavior shows the Solana price holding near major resistance levels after its earlier move, while the XRP price continues to focus on ecosystem development rather than fast price expansion. These established assets remain in a pause phase, waiting for stronger signals to drive their next direction."

(CSE:HODL) (NASDAQ:STKE), a company focused on the Solana blockchain ecosystem, reported holding 523,134 SOL tokens valued at approximately CAD101.47 million as of January 6, 2026, according to a press release statement. The company, currently trading at $2.19 USD with a market cap of $60.7 million, has seen a remarkable 43.14% price return over the past week despite being considered overvalued according to InvestingPro analysis.\nThe company participated in Solana Breakpoint, the network\u2019s annual conference, and co-hosted Block Zero, a validator-focused summit in December. Interim CEO Michael Hubbard showcased open-source tooling developed by the company to support Solana validator operators. With a Financial Health score rated as \"FAIR\" and a beta of 1.56, the stock exhibits higher volatility than the broader market, one of several insights available through InvestingPro\u2019s comprehensive research reports covering 1,400+ US equities.\nSOL Strategies announced on December 31 the restructuring and repayment terms of its credit facility with Tony Guoga, the company\u2019s largest shareholder, which the company stated would simplify its balance sheet and reduce liabilities. This restructuring comes as the company manages $37.31 million in total debt with a concerning current ratio of just 0.11, indicating short-term obligations exceed liquid assets.\nThe firm reported managing 3,354,203 SOL in Assets Under Delegation across 26,908 unique wallets. Its proprietary validators earned approximately 925 SOL in December and maintained 99.999% uptime, according to the company.\nOn January 2, 2026, SOL Strategies entered into an at-the-market equity offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation, and Roth Capital Partners, LLC, providing for the ability to sell up to US$50 million of common shares through direct issuances on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe company plans to participate in upcoming investor events including the Roth Conference in Laguna Beach, California in March and Canaccord Digital Asset Event in London in February.\nIn other recent news, Sol Strategies Inc. reported its Q4 2025 earnings, revealing a difficult quarter with an earnings per share of -1.15, which did not meet analyst forecasts. The company\u2019s revenue was CAD 5.4 million, also falling short of expectations. Despite these financial challenges, Sol Strategies announced a strategic shift towards focusing on the Solana blockchain, aiming to increase its market share in 2026. This development comes as the company tries to navigate a competitive landscape and address its recent financial performance. Investors and analysts will likely be closely watching how Sol Strategies executes this new strategic direction in the coming year.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The Dow rose 270.03 points, or 0.55%, to 49,266.11; the S&P 500 edged up 0.01% and the Nasdaq fell 0.44%. Reuters\nThe market is trying to price two messages at once: a bigger spending push that could fatten defense backlogs, and a tougher line on contractors\u2019 shareholder payouts. Trump said the 2027 military budget should be $1.5 trillion, versus $901 billion approved by Congress for 2026, though any increase would need lawmakers\u2019 sign-off. Reuters\nRates traders also kept one eye on the data after a stretch of disrupted releases tied to last year\u2019s long government shutdown. Weekly jobless claims rose 8,000 to 208,000, while a Reuters survey showed economists expect December payroll growth of 60,000 and an unemployment rate of 4.5%. \u201cFirms are successfully doing more with less labor,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Reuters\nDefense shares snapped back after Wednesday\u2019s slide, with investors leaning on the idea that more spending would outweigh tighter rules on buybacks and dividends. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Kristine Liwag wrote: \u201cA limit on capital return is an incremental negative, but the size is manageable.\u201d Investing\nStill, Trump\u2019s executive order raised the stakes for the sector. The order said contractors would be barred from dividends and stock buybacks until they deliver \u201con time and on budget,\u201d and it directed Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth to identify underperforming firms within 30 days, with changes to future contracts to follow. Reuters\nTechnology weighed, with Nvidia down 2.2%, Broadcom off 3.2% and Microsoft down 1.1%, as investors grew pickier on AI-linked names. \u201cWhile AI is still hot, there are going to be winners and losers,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. GV Wire\nWithin the Dow, Home Depot and Sherwin-Williams did much of the heavy lifting, a reminder that the index is price-weighted \u2014 higher-priced stocks move it more. Home Depot rose $12.74 and Sherwin-Williams gained $9.59, together contributing about 137 points to the Dow\u2019s advance, with Nike, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble also helping, MarketWatch reported. MarketWatch\nCompany headlines also kept a pulse on the index. JPMorgan Chase and Apple said the bank will become the new issuer of the Apple Card, replacing Goldman Sachs, in a deal expected to transfer more than $20 billion of card balances once completed; Goldman CEO David Solomon said the move \u201csubstantially completes\u201d the narrowing of the firm\u2019s consumer focus. Reuters\nBut the path into Friday looks messy: a big policy-driven bid for defense can collide with budget math and congressional friction, and a hot jobs print could push yields up again. Valuations are still \u201crelatively pricey\u201d heading into earnings season, with the S&P 500 trading around 22 times expected earnings \u2014 a price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 above its five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. Reuters\nNext up is Friday\u2019s U.S. employment report for December \u2014 the nonfarm payrolls count, which excludes farm workers \u2014 due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

You\u2019ll notice new modules on homepages, market pages, and other spots, where the numbers update constantly.\nBasically, you\u2019ll get a live look at what traders think will happen with everything from the economy and corporate earnings to politics and other big events.\nHonestly, this is a bold step for a well-established news company. By bringing in Polymarket\u2019s prices, numbers that come from what real traders believe about future events, Dow Jones gives readers a fresh way to gauge what people actually expect to happen in the world.\nWhat the Partnership Includes\nDow Jones isn\u2019t just adding real-time odds and probabilities; they have more in the pipeline. They\u2019re working on new features for everyday readers, all powered by Polymarket\u2019s data.\nOne of the big ones is a custom earnings calendar. Instead of just listing dates, it\u2019ll show what the market actually expects from each company\u2019s upcoming earnings. So, readers can poke around and see, in real-time, how traders are betting on results.\nYou\u2019ll also start seeing Polymarket\u2019s prediction data right next to regular news coverage.

Project, Token, Airdrop, Roadmap Explained\nExecutives on the Deal\nIn the announcement, CEO of Dow Jones and Publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Almar Latour, highlighted the importance of prediction markets as an emerging avenue for real-time understanding of collective trends regarding future events.\nLatour stated that the partnership advances the goal of Dow Jones to aid customers in making defensible choices based on trustworthy news, data, and analysis.\nIn the words of Polymarket co-founder and CEO Shayne Coplan, the partnership aims to elevate the level of accessible and better information that is driven by data.\nHe stated that the integration of journalistic expertise and real-time market probabilities will offer a unique and rich news experience to users of all of Dow Jones\u2019s platforms.\nA Broader Trend in Media and Markets\nThe partnership illustrates how news and data companies are beginning to use prediction markets in addition to more standard forecasting options like polls and analyst surveys.\nIn the last several years, more and more data companies are using prediction markets to better understand and forecast the future, particularly because prediction markets are simpler to use and provide updated, real-time data about the collective beliefs of a market.\nThis was the case with prediction market platforms like Polymarket during the last two U.S. presidential elections, with customers correctly predicting market outcomes before traditional news outlets had an opportunity to report or analyse the outcomes.\nMedia and financial data companies are trying to find ways to incorporate prediction markets into their products and services, and financial services and media companies like Dow Jones have become more active in developing prediction market products.\nIt is no surprise that they have established partnerships with data companies like Kalshi that are prediction market-based and have partnered with media companies like CNN and CNBC to provide real-time data about the media\u2019s predictions of the economy and politics."

This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago \u2014 sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% \u2014 down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\nOil price pressure\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil \u2014 still under tough sanctions \u2014 back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

                "body": "DAX 40 Outlook for 2026\nThe past two years were defined by economic fatigue. Output contracted in both 2023 and 2024, industrial capacity utilisation sank, and Germany\u2019s export-led economy came under sustained pressure from high energy costs, weak global demand and intensifying competition from China. In 2025, growth barely lifted its head above zero, leaving the economy stuck in what could be described as \u201cstructural stagnation.\u201d\nYet beneath the surface, the foundations for a cyclical recovery are being laid. A dramatic fiscal pivot, easing monetary conditions and improving domestic demand set the stage for 2026 to potentially mark a turning point, not a renaissance, but a re-rating.\nWhy 2026 Matters More Than 2025\nConsensus expectations for German GDP growth in 2026 cluster between 0.7% and 1.6%, with several leading institutes now converging around the 1% handle. The German Council of Economic Experts forecasts growth of 0.9%, while institutes such as ifo, IfW and the Halle Institute for Economic Research see upside risks if fiscal spending accelerates and trade tensions stabilise.\nImportantly, this growth is not expected to be organic. Roughly one-third of the expansion stems from calendar effects, as 2026 benefits from additional working days. Another meaningful share is driven by government spending from defence, infrastructure and climate-related investment funds. Private-sector momentum remains fragile but no longer collapsing, and that distinction matters for equity markets.\nFiscal Expansion Becomes a Structural Tailwind\nGermany\u2019s move away from fiscal orthodoxy is arguably the most important macro development for the DAX outlook. The easing of the debt brake, the creation of a \u20ac500 billion off-budget infrastructure and climate fund, and the expansion of defence spending have altered the medium-term earnings backdrop.\nHowever, these measures will not transform the economy overnight. Bureaucracy, labour shortages and slow project execution remain binding constraints. But fiscal stimulus tends to have its strongest market impact not when it peaks, but when expectations turn, and that inflection appears to be approaching.\nFor German equities, this matters because it directly supports sectors with heavy index weightings, particularly Industrials and Financials. Defence contractors, engineering firms, construction suppliers and capital-goods manufacturers stand to benefit disproportionately from higher public investment, even if the initial multiplier effect is muted.\nTariffs, Trade and the Trump Variable\nNo discussion of Germany\u2019s outlook in 2026 is complete without addressing tariffs, which have become a material headwind for the export drive country. The United States remains Germany\u2019s single largest export destination and the German automotive sector has been hit hardest, with car exports to the United States falling by nearly 15% in the first three quarters of 2025. Under a revised trade agreement reached in August, the US imposed a 15% baseline tariff on European car imports. While this was lower than the initially threatened 25% rate, it has still significantly curtailed demand, marking a sharp reversal after several years of steady export growth.\nThe impact extends well beyond autos. Overall, German exports to the US declined by 7.8% over the past year, with machinery, chemicals and industrial components also under pressure. Machinery exports were particularly affected by steep US tariffs on steel and aluminium, while chemical exports fell by nearly 10%, reflecting a combination of trade barriers and weaker domestic production caused by high energy costs. With tariffs unlikely to be rolled back in the near term, Germany is accelerating its efforts to diversify trade relationships within Europe and markets such as India and Indonesia. Reducing reliance on the US is no longer a strategic aspiration, but an economic necessity.\nThe Problem of Stronger Euro\nA firmer euro is emerging as a more immediate headwind. After a"

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Healthcare Services\n- /\n- NasdaqGS:PGNY\nProgyny (NASDAQ:PGNY) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last year\nThe simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) share price is up 47% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 17% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 18% in three years.\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Progyny investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's one-year performance.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nProgyny was able to grow EPS by 5.2% in the last twelve months. This EPS growth is significantly lower than the 47% increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is now more optimistic about the stock.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\nA Different Perspective\nIt's nice to see that Progyny shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over the last year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 7% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Trading volume jumped to 27,101,000.00 shares, well above the 50-day average, ahead of an earnings report scheduled for Jan 13, 2026. We view the move as short-term positioning ahead of the earnings catalyst and highlight valuation, technicals, and our model forecast for active traders and investors.\nEarnings catalyst: LHSW stock and the Jan 13 report\nLHSW stock faces a clear catalyst with the earnings announcement due Jan 13, 2026 at 08:30 ET. Market participants often reprice small-cap technology names before reports. Volume spiked to 27,101,000.00 shares on Jan 08 2026, which suggests positioning ahead of the release.\nExpect management commentary on product traction for machine vision and guidance for 2026. The upcoming report is the most likely near-term driver of intraday volatility for Lianhe Sowell International Group Ltd Ordinary Shares (LHSW) on NASDAQ.\nIntraday price action and liquidity for LHSW stock\nPrice opened at $0.61 and traded as high as $0.99 before settling at $0.84 intraday. That move equals a 7.14% gain versus the prior close of $0.78. Average volume is 638,619.00, so today\u2019s 27,101,000.00 shows outsized interest.\nHigh relative volume improves tradeability but increases short-term risk. Shares outstanding are 52,000,000.00, and market capitalization stands at $42,848,000.00, keeping LHSW in the microcap bucket on NASDAQ in the United States (USD).\nValuation and financial snapshot for LHSW stock\nOn basic metrics LHSW shows EPS $0.06 and a trailing P/E of 13.73. The 50-day average price is $1.30 and the 200-day average is $2.13, both above the current price. The annual high is $8.18 and the annual low is $0.51, reflecting sharp post-IPO volatility.\nKey ratios include price-to-sales 1.15, EV/EBITDA 12.54, current ratio 1.24, and interest coverage 30.27. These figures suggest modest leverage and positive margins, but small absolute earnings and cash flow volatility remain important risks for investors in Lianhe Sowell International Group Ltd Ordinary Shares (LHSW).\nTechnical read: momentum, trend and intraday signals for LHSW stock\nShort-term momentum is mixed: RSI is 44.31, MACD histogram is slightly positive, and ADX is strong at 58.32. Bollinger Bands show an intraday range with upper band $0.99 and lower band $0.43, matching today\u2019s action.\nHigh on-balance volume and an MFI at 96.35 indicate heavy buying pressure. Traders should watch support near $0.61 and resistance near $1.00 for intraday setups ahead of earnings.\nRisks and opportunities for LHSW stock investors\nOpportunity: Lianhe Sowell focuses on machine vision for electronics manufacturing, a niche with scalable demand if product wins accelerate. A positive earnings beat or stronger guidance could re-rate the stock intraday.\nRisk: The company is a recently listed microcap with thin fundamentals. Receivables days are long at 205.59 and free cash flow metrics are negative, raising operational risk if orders slow. Regulatory and China-market risks also matter for NASDAQ-listed Chinese technology firms.\nMeyka grade, model forecast and price targets for LHSW stock\nMeyka AI rates LHSW with a score out of 100: 73.996 (Grade B+, Suggestion: BUY). This grade factors in S&P 500 benchmark comparison, sector performance, financial growth, key metrics, and analyst consensus. These grades are not guaranteed and are not financial advice.\nMeyka AI\u2019s forecast model projects a 12-month target of $0.65. Versus the current price $0.84, that implies an estimated -22.36% downside. Scenario targets: Bear $0.45, Base $0.65, Bull $1.50. Forecasts are model-based projections and not guarantees.

How healthy are they?\nSome experts say red meat and full-fat dairy can be high in saturated fats.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced updated federal dietary guidelines on Tuesday, though some of the recommendations are being challenged by health experts.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are updated every five years, recommended that Americans limit highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.\nSome nutrition and diet experts, however, questioned other recommendations, including consuming red meat and full-fat dairy, a reversal of past nutrition guidance.\nThey told ABC News that while red meat and full-fat dairy can be part of a heathy diet, they also can be high in sodium and saturated fats, which can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nEmphasis on red meat and protein\nIn a factsheet released along with the guidelines, the administration said it was recommending that American prioritize eating protein-rich foods with every meal including red meat, poultry, seafood and eggs in addition to plant-sourced protein foods.\nThis is a stark contrast from past years in which guidelines have encouraged Americans to limit the amount of red meat being consumed.\nNutrition experts contend that red meat is high in protein and contains several nutrients including iron, zinc, potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.\nHowever, some experts add that red meat is also high in saturated fats, which has been shown to increase levels of \"bad\" cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease, according to the American Heart Association.\nAdditionally, the 2025 Scientific Report -- an independent report written by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that helps the HHS and Department of Agriculture develop the next set of dietary guidelines -- found that reducing items with saturated fats, such as processed and unprocessed red meat with plant-based protein foods, can lower cardiovascular disease risk.\n\"I'm concerned about the focus on protein and if we're telling people to have protein at every meal that might increase overall meat consumption, and for many Americans that could also increase saturated fat intake, especially if people lean toward red meat rather than lean cuts of meat, seafood beans, nuts, and seeds as their protein sources,\" Maya Feller, a registered dietitian based in New York City, told ABC News.\nThe factsheet also claimed that previous federal dietary guidelines have \"demonized\" protein in favor of carbohydrates.\n\"Protein was never demonized in U.S. dietary guidelines. As it is, Americans are consuming protein in amounts well above the amount that is necessary to sustain health and development,\" Marie-Pierre St-Onge, a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, told ABC News.\nThe guidelines also advise adults to consume between 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\nFeller said there isn't enough evidence to suggest that all Americans need to be consuming that much protein, and that a variety of protein sources is beneficial.\n\"The majority of the population has one or more non-communicable diseases, which require thoughtful meal planning to adjust macronutrient needs,\" she said. \"Increasing protein intake should include a variety of proteins from both plant and animal sources.\"\nThe American Heart Association said in a statement on Wednesday that it welcomes the new dietary guidelines and its emphasis on fruits and vegetables while limiting highly processed foods and added sugars.\nHowever, regarding protein, the AHA said it encourages prioritizing plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including \"red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.\"\nMixed views on full-fat dairy\nU.S. health officials said during a press conference on Wednesday that full"

                "body": "New federal dietary recommendations have sparked mixed reactions from the embattled restaurant industry, as changing guidelines could encourage Americans to dine out less often or choose from a smaller pool of restaurants when they do leave home.\nThe departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled the nutrition guidelines on Wednesday. The recommendations, which are updated every five years, pushed for higher consumption of protein and full-fat dairy and reduced intake of processed foods and sugary drinks.\nThe guidelines are primarily a public health tool for federal agencies, health-care providers and nutrition experts, so it's unclear how much they will influence individual consumer choices. Although the recommendations largely focus on eating at home, they lightly touched on the restaurant industry as well.\n\"When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options,\" the guidelines advise.\nWhile the recommendations could discourage Americans from spending at restaurants \u2014 especially at a time when high inflation has curbed trips to dine out \u2014 some pockets of the industry had a positive reaction to the changes. The changes could give a particular boost to struggling fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle, which have long touted the type of natural ingredients championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make American Healthy Again\" movement.\nOne lobbying executive who represents restaurant companies, whose organization was involved in meetings with the White House on the new guidelines, said the outcome could have been \"far worse\" for the sector. The person, who declined to be named because their organization was involved in private discussions, said the end result was better for the industry than proposed guidance from earlier in 2025 was.\nHowever, the executive said they are still concerned the guidelines could encourage Americans to eat at home when diners have affordable options to incorporate those foods at restaurants. That implication could also ruffle feathers among restaurant chains and their franchisees.\nDespite those potential concerns from some, industry lobbying group the National Restaurant Association backed the new guidelines.\n\"Now, more than ever, restaurant operators are offering a wider variety of options, allowing consumers to choose what best fits their dietary needs, preferences, and lifestyles. We congratulate Secretary Kennedy and the Trump Administration on the release of the new guidelines and look forward to continued collaboration with policymakers to ensure that nutrition guidance remains practical, flexible, and supportive of access and innovation,\" National Restaurant Association spokesman Sean Kennedy said in a statement to CNBC.\nRestaurant franchise lobbyist the International Franchise Association, called the approach \"nuanced\" and said it may limit the number of price increases restaurants have to make.\n\"Fortunately, the more nuanced approach of these guidelines helps ensure our members will not have to raise prices and that consumers can continue to make their own choices,\" the group said. \"Any future regulations or guidance must keep potential cost increases top of mind, as restaurant owners already face numerous regulatory burdens and supply chain challenges, which most often disproportionately affect small business owners, like franchisees, and ultimately, American consumers.\"\nHow fast casual could benefit\nSome of the most supportive reactions came from chains that had been beaten down in 2025, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Both fast-casual names saw pullbacks from younger consumers who continue to struggle in a K-shaped economy, where spending has concentrated more among the highest earners.\nLoading chart...\nSweetgreen, which was the biggest restaurant sector laggard last year with a nearly 80% stock decline, cheered the new guidelines.\nA spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We keep ultra-processed ingredients and added sugars out of our restaurants, sour"

                "source": "ESPN",
                "url": "https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/47541426/demond-williams-jr-case-test-viability-signed-contracts-college-sports",
                "body": "Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr.'s announcement Tuesday night that he plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal sent shockwaves through college sports.\nFour days earlier, he'd signed a contract to return to Washington, which was set to pay him in the mid-$4 million range and put him near the top the market for college football. Washington continues to pursue legal action, per sources, to enforce the contract.\nWilliams' declaration online that he is leaving quickly became a touchstone for a sport and system where there's already significant skepticism over the viability of signed contracts.\nWhat happens next with Williams will speak volumes about the future of college football and the enforceability of contracts, providing a bellwether for this new era of college sports.\n\"This is a very bright line,\" a high-ranking college official said. \"Are we going to respect each other's contracts? This is a very simple thing. If we can't protect this, nothing else matters.\"\nIf Williams follows through on his desire to leave Washington -- LSU is the presumptive favorite for his services, but others are expected to be involved as well -- his case will be a litmus test for the rules of a new era. And it will likely end up in court.\nThe situation can be boiled down to a simple point that has been a running issue and an embarrassment for college sports: Can contracts be enforced?\n\"This situation is a product of 2026 football,\" a prominent athletic director told ESPN. \"Where the story ends, this is one of the big moments in college football -- or really, college sports -- and what we do next.\"\nWhen initially contacted, Demond Williams Sr. -- the quarterback's father -- declined to comment.\nIf Williams attempts to leave for LSU or another school, it is likely to become a bigger saga than former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava's jump from Tennessee to UCLA last year.\nIt's also a potentially much higher-profile version of the legal fallout -- still unresolved -- from the departure last fall of Wisconsin defensive back Xavier Lucas to Miami.\nWisconsin sued Miami claiming the school committed tortious interference by knowingly compelling a player to break the terms of his deal with the Badgers.\nWilliams is a household name in the Big Ten and among college sports fans, as he threw for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns this season. He also ran for 611 yards and six touchdowns. Williams was originally committed to coach Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss in 2023 before flipping to Jedd Fisch and Arizona. He followed Fisch to Washington when Fisch took the head coaching job there in 2024.\n\"This wouldn't happen in professional sports,\" another high-ranking college official said. \"Things like this seem to show that people think that they can do anything.\"\nThe college sports world is watching intently. One general manager at a top program told ESPN on Wednesday: \"It's extremely embarrassing the system allows this. There's no stability at all. How are people sitting around watching everything crumble? What are the leaders doing? What are the commissioners doing? How do we not get everyone in a room and not leave until there's a solution.\"\nOne veteran head coach added with a chuckle on the lack of oversight: \"I don't even know who we turn complaints in to.\"\nWashington sources say the university is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' contract. The Big Ten has also been engaged on the issue, and the league has been vocal in the past about how crucial it is that \"agreed-to obligations be respected, honored and enforced.\" Williams used a traditional agency to complete his deal. Sources said there had been outreach for more than two weeks from people outside the agency to schools. The agency that did his deal was blindsided by Williams' portal entry.\nPer sources, one person who has contacted schools about Williams is Cordell Landers, who generally refers to himself as an adviser and loomed as one of the central figures in Iamaleava's departure"

                "body": "Why Japanese equities look attractive in 2026 \u2013 Part one\n|Asian markets opened 2026 with remarkable momentum, as indices from Japan, Singapore and South Korea climbed to fresh record highs on Tuesday, January 6th. Despite geopolitical turbulence\u2014including the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, global investors appear increasingly focused on opportunities beyond American shores, as sentiment toward U.S. equities cools.\nConcerns about tariff uncertainty and elevated tech sector valuations prompt many investors to look abroad for better risk-adjusted returns in 2026. Among international markets, Japan emerged as a standout performer and a compelling investment option. The surprise election of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister last year ushered in a new era of fiscal support, while the country\u2019s phased shareholder reforms continued gaining traction. The Nikkei 225 surged more than 27% in 2025 and many analysts believe that this momentum can continue in 2026.\nThis two-part series examines the key factors behind this bullish outlook. Let\u2019s dive into the first two drivers:\nJapanese equities look relatively cheap\nFor over a decade, the narrative of global finance was synonymous with U.S. exceptionalism. But 2025 marked a turning point. As the performance gap between U.S. and international markets narrowed, investors began rotating capital into overlooked opportunities abroad in search of better returns.\nThe Japanese equity market emerged as a primary beneficiary of this shift, with the Nikkei 225 surging over 25% in 2025\u2014outstripping the S&P 500\u2019s 17% gain. Seasoned investors might instinctively dismiss such performance as another synthetic rally, where a depreciating yen flatters exporters\u2019 earnings while eroding returns for dollar-based portfolios. However, the 2025 rally told a fundamentally different story.\nDespite the Bank of Japan\u2019s pivot toward monetary policy tightening\u2014raising rates twice during the year to reach a 30-year high of 0.75%\u2014the yen remained remarkably stable against the dollar. This stability signals something more substantial than currency-driven momentum. Investors appear to be betting that Japan\u2019s transition into a virtuous cycle of growth and inflation represents a structural shift rather than a temporary phenomenon.\nA key driver of optimism for continued Japanese equity strength in 2026 lies in the market\u2019s relative affordability. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio reveals a valuation gap across global markets. This metric shows how much investors currently pay for each dollar of a company\u2019s expected future earnings, providing a clear benchmark for comparing whether markets are relatively cheap or expensive.\nEquity Valuation by Market - Source: BlackRock Investment Institute & LSEG Datastream data as of December 16 2025\nAccording to BlackRock Investment Institute data as of December 16, 2025, Japanese equities trade at a forward P/E ratio slightly above 15. While this sits marginally above Japan\u2019s own 10-year historical average, it remains remarkably attractive when viewed through a global lens. U.S. equities, by contrast, command a forward P/E ratio of around 22\u2014meaning investors are paying a 47% premium in the U.S. markets for future earnings compared to their Japanese counterparts.\nThe elevated U.S. ratio reflects extreme optimism already embedded in prices, leaving little margin for error if corporate earnings disappoint. Japan\u2019s lower ratio suggests either that assets remain undervalued or that the market has yet to fully price in the country\u2019s corporate governance reforms and successful exit from decades of deflation. Given the structural improvements underway in Japanese corporate culture, the latter interpretation appears increasingly credible.\nThis valuation opportunity has not gone unnoticed by institutional investors. BlackRock expects continuing investor interest in Japanese markets through 2026. A BlackRock client survey conducted as of November 24, 2025, indicated that a"
