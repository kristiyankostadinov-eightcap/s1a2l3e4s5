In the wake of the Fed\u2019s decision, Britain and Mexico have lowered rates, whereas the eurozone, Norway, and Sweden have signalled a continued pause. The Bank of Japan tightened its policy, raising the overnight rate to its highest level since 1995 at 0.75%. Nevertheless, the US dollar strengthened against major world currencies on expectations of a prolonged pause in the process of lowering the federal funds rate.\nThe Bank of England lowered the repo rate to 3.75% by five votes to four. Andrew Bailey warned of limited room for manoeuvre in the monetary expansion cycle in 2026. As a result, the futures market reduced its expected scale to 25 basis points. The pound initially strengthened, but a reassessment of US inflation data brought GBPUSD back down to earth.\nAs expected, the ECB raised its eurozone GDP forecasts to 1.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. The central bank expects inflation to remain below target until 2028. Christine Lagarde did not encourage the \u2018hawks\u2019 who had previously discussed raising deposit rates. The Frenchwoman repeated the mantra that the European Central Bank is in a comfortable position. The EURUSD\u2019s inability to break through resistance at 1.176 resulted in a sell-off.\nThe Bank of Japan raised its overnight rate to 0.75%. This outcome of the December meeting was predicted by all 50 Bloomberg experts. In this regard, after the BoJ\u2019s verdict, a sell-off of the yen began on the facts. Moreover, the Governing Council did not signal a continuation of the cycle of monetary tightening.\nThe US dollar strengthened against major world currencies as investors ignored the slowdown in US core inflation to 2.6% in November. This is the lowest level since the beginning of 2021. After the shutdown, the BLS is experiencing problems with data. It will take time for confidence in it to return.\nThe market\u2019s reluctance to take US consumer price statistics at face value played a cruel joke on gold. The precious metal hit a new local high but failed to reach a record high and was forced to retreat due to the strengthening of the US dollar. According to Goldman Sachs, structurally high demand from central banks for bullion and cyclical support from the Fed\u2019s rate cuts will continue to create tailwinds for Gold.\nThe FxPro Analyst Team\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

Among the most important indicators for global crude oil markets are estimates of OPEC\u2019s effective crude oil production capacity and surplus production capacity, as well as any disruptions to liquid fuels production. Low surplus production capacity among OPEC countries can put upward pressure on crude oil prices in the event of unplanned supply disruptions or strong growth in global oil demand.\nIn our December STEO, we updated our estimates of OPEC crude oil production capacity based on the most recent information available as well as new definitions of maximum sustainable and effective crude oil production capacity. This update resulted in an increase in OPEC capacity of 0.22 million barrels per day (b/d) on average in 2024, 0.37 million b/d on average in 2025, and 0.31 million b/d on average in 2026, with similar increases to OPEC surplus capacity given limited changes to our estimates of actual OPEC crude oil production.\nHow EIA defines maximum sustainable and effective crude oil production capacity\nMaximum sustainable capacity is the maximum rate of production that could theoretically be reached within a year, assuming existing production capacity is fully utilized and no disruptions occur.\nWe base our estimates of maximum sustainable capacity on public and governmental sources. OPEC countries report production capacity in their annual reports or other financial documents, and capacity estimates for many of these countries are available in trade press, news reports, and U.S. governmental sources such as embassy reporting. Because both the estimated values and the definitions of capacity from these various sources may be inconsistent, EIA makes its own independent estimates for maximum sustainable capacity.\nEffective production capacity is calculated as the difference between maximum sustainable capacity and any disruptions. Effective production capacity is the rate of crude oil production that could be reached within 90 days and sustained, using sound practices that avoid damage to oil fields or their operations. We use this definition for the capacity estimates in the STEO because it most accurately describes the capacity available at any given time to meet market demand. Currently, we estimate that only a handful of counties within OPEC have surplus capacity.\nNameplate capacity, a metric used by industry participants to define production capacity for a country, is the total amount of production capacity that has been installed over time. However, we do not use this metric in the STEO forecast because production capacity can be damaged or degraded over time, overstating available capacity.\nHow EIA defines disruptions\nWe define a disruption as an unplanned oil production outage. Disruptions are due to events out of an oil producer\u2019s control, such as wars, sanctions, strikes, political uprisings, fires, weather-related events, or unscheduled equipment outages. Voluntary production cutbacks are not considered to be disruptions because they can be reversed at any time.\nA sudden decline in production may indicate that a disruption has occurred. EIA validates whether a disruption has occurred by reviewing trade press, news reports, and company reports, and through conversations with industry. Scheduled maintenance, like that which occurs in the North Sea every summer, results in seasonal declines in production that are not considered to be disruptions.\nHow EIA defines surplus crude oil production capacity\nSurplus production capacity\u2014sometimes called spare capacity\u2014describes the available production capacity held back as part of a coordinated agreement by OPEC or OPEC+ members. Because the withheld production is part of a voluntary agreement, it is not considered a disruption.

The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is November 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output for September 2025 was not revised and October 2025 output was revised higher by 21 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report. OPEC 12 output decreased by 1 kb/d with the largest increases from Saudi Arabia (54 kb/d), UAE (16 kb/d), and Kuwait (13 kb/d). Venezuela (-27 kb/d), Iraq (-21 kb/d), and Iran (-19 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases or decreases of 11 kb/d or less.\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas and where most of OPEC spare capacity currently exists (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 766 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 20073 kb/d in November 2025. The Big 4 may have about 766 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 20073 kb/d, an increase of 1727 kb/d in just 7 months (an average monthly increase of 247 kb/d.) The rate of increase in Big 4 output seems to be reaching a plateau. Note that some spare capacity remains if increased output is needed and also that UAE has surpassed the 2022 CTMA peak by some 250 kb/d, if this recent level of output can be maintained for 12 months or more then the spare capacity of OPEC would be 250 kb/d higher than the 766 kb/d indicated on the chart above, we will have to see what happens over the next 12 months.\nNo change in World demand from last month\u2019s MOMR, Non DOC liquids and DOC NGLs have been revised higher in 2025 by 100 kb/d.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the Middle East.) OPEC data shows the previous peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters (ending 2025Q3) the average World refinery throughput was 81.84 Mb/d, a new annual average peak which is revised higher than last month\u2019s report by 70 kb/d.\nFrom the December MOMR:\nPreliminary October 2025 data shows that OECD commercial inventories fell by 32.0 Mb, m-o-m, to stand at 2,833 Mb. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 62.7 Mb higher than at the same time last year, but 12.4 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 112.7 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC expects only a 50 kb/d increase in annual average 2025 tight oil output in 2025 and an annual average decrease of 100 kb/d for US tight oil output in 2026."

                "body": "Oil prices are limping into the final weeks of 2025 with Brent crude hovering just above $60 a barrel and traders fixated on one word: oversupply. As of Friday, December 12, Brent settled at about $61.12 per barrel and WTI at $57.44, both benchmarks down more than 4% for the week and sitting near their lowest levels in several years. [1]\nAt the same time, big agencies and Wall Street banks are rolling out fresh forecasts that increasingly point to sub\u2011$60 oil in 2026, even as OPEC insists the market will be roughly balanced next year. [2]\nThis article pulls together the latest December 2025 data, forecasts and analysis to sketch out a near\u2011term oil price forecast for December 2025, and what it might mean for 2026.\nWhere oil prices stand in mid\u2011December 2025\n- Spot prices:\n- Year\u2011to\u2011date performance:\nBrent has fallen roughly 18% in 2025 so far, while WTI is down close to 20%, as the market has steadily priced out the war\u2011driven risk premium of the early 2020s and refocused on swelling supply. [5] - Price levels vs recent history:\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that North Sea Dated crude (a physical benchmark related to Brent) averaged about $63.63 per barrel in November, its fifth monthly decline in a row and the longest losing streak in over a decade \u2014 effectively putting prices near four\u2011year lows. [6]\nIn short, December 2025 oil prices are weak, but not collapsing: Brent is holding around the low $60s, yet sentiment is sharply bearish because of what\u2019s happening in supply, demand and inventories.\nWhy the market has turned bearish going into December\n1. A supply surge colliding with only modest demand growth\nThe IEA\u2019s December 2025 Oil Market Report paints a clear picture:\n- Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 860,000 bpd in 2026. [7]\n- But global oil supply is set to grow much faster \u2013 roughly 3 million bpd in 2025 and another 2.4 million bpd in 2026, driven heavily by non\u2011OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Brazil and Guyana. [8]\nThat imbalance is now showing up in stockpiles:\n- Observed global oil inventories hit around 8.03 billion barrels in October, the highest in four years, with stock builds averaging 1.2 million bpd in the first ten months of 2025. [9]\n- The IEA estimates the implied surplus at nearly 3.7 million bpd on average from Q4 2025 through 2026 \u2013 an unusually large overhang for this stage of the cycle. [10]\nThat\u2019s why recent IEA forecasts of a glut have become one of the main downward forces on prices this month.\n2. \u201cOil on water\u201d and the emerging \u201csuper glut\u201d narrative\nA big part of the story is where the barrels are sitting. The IEA highlights a surge in oil on water \u2014 crude in transit or temporarily floating \u2014 as sanctioned barrels struggle to find buyers and long\u2011haul shipments from the Americas to Asia jump. [11]\nPrivate\u2011sector and media analysis has picked this up and sharpened it:\n- A widely discussed Financial Times piece cites Trafigura\u2019s chief economist warning of a coming \u201csuper glut\u201d in 2026 as new supply projects ramp up while demand growth softens. He points to new output from Brazil and Guyana, cooling Chinese demand (partly due to EV adoption), and resilient U.S. supply. [12]\n- A detailed WRAL/FinancialContent analysis similarly describes a \u201csuper glut\u201d in crude, with non\u2011OPEC+ supply from the U.S., Brazil, Canada and Guyana consistently outpacing demand, while EV adoption and industrial slowdowns cap consumption. [13]\nTaken together, the narrative going into December is clear: there is simply too much oil around, and it\u2019s increasingly visible in both inventories and shipping data.\n3. Agencies now see lower average prices ahead\nThe latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Short\u2011Term Energy Outlook, released on December 9, 2025, explicitly bakes falling prices into its forecast: [14]\n- The EIA expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, putting continuing downward pressure on prices.\n- It projects Brent cru"

EIA calculates surplus crude oil production capacity as the difference between the effective production "

                "body": "The OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for December 2025 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is November 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output for September 2025 was not revised and October 2025 output was revised higher by 21 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report. OPEC 12 output decreased by 1 kb/d with the largest increases from Saudi Arabia (54 kb/d), UAE (16 kb/d), and Kuwait (13 kb/d). Venezuela (-27 kb/d), Iraq (-21 kb/d), and Iran (-19 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases or decreases of 11 kb/d or less.\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas and where most of OPEC spare capacity currently exists (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 766 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 20073 kb/d in November 2025. The Big 4 may have about 766 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 20073 kb/d, an increase of 1727 kb/d in just 7 months (an average monthly increase of 247 kb/d.) The rate of increase in Big 4 output seems to be reaching a plateau. Note that some spare capacity remains if increased output is needed and also that UAE has surpassed the 2022 CTMA peak by some 250 kb/d, if this recent level of output can be maintained for 12 months or more then the spare capacity of OPEC would be 250 kb/d higher than the 766 kb/d indicated on the chart above, we will have to see what happens over the next 12 months.\nNo change in World demand from last month\u2019s MOMR, Non DOC liquids and DOC NGLs have been revised higher in 2025 by 100 kb/d.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the Middle East.) OPEC data shows the previous peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters (ending 2025Q3) the average World refinery throughput was 81.84 Mb/d, a new annual average peak which is revised higher than last month\u2019s report by 70 kb/d.\nFrom the December MOMR:\nPreliminary October 2025 data shows that OECD commercial inventories fell by 32.0 Mb, m-o-m, to stand at 2,833 Mb. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 62.7 Mb higher than at the same time last year, but 12.4 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 112.7 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC expects only a 50 kb/d increase in annual average 2025 tight oil output in 2025 and an annual average decrease of 100 kb/d for US tight oil output in 2026."

                "body": "The EUR/USD bounced back from its earlier lows on Friday, after a week that turned out to be far less eventful than should have been when you consider the fact that we have had US CPI and nonfarm payrolls report, and several central bank rate decisions, including from the European Central Bank. Heading into the final weeks of the year the EUR/USD forecast remains slightly positive, owing to both a firm euro and a neutral-to-weak US dollar. The ECB is neutral, and no one is expecting them to cut rates further in early 2026 anyway, leaving the US dollar and the Fed to dictate direction for this pair. But don\u2019t expect any fireworks until the turn of the year, when we will have fresh un-interrupted December data. From here, an eventual rise to $1.20 looks the more likely outcome than a drop to $1.15.\nWith US inflation falling, can EUR/USD kick on from here?\nThe EUR/USD failed to react in the way you\u2019d expect when US CPI came in at 2.7%, which was sharply lower than expected, leaving the door open for earlier 2026 rate cuts from the Fed. One would have thought that it should keep the dollar undermined. But it hasn\u2019t, so far. Whether the weakness in US inflation will have a longer-term impact on the dollar and limit the downside risks for the EUR/USD remains to be seen. Clearly, there was some scepticism about this particular inflation report given what the government shutdown meant for data collation. So, markets have decided not to overreact to this CPI report and await the December report, due in January. But it is nonetheless clear that the impact of tariffs on inflation has turned out to be a lot milder than many had expected. With the calendar effect and recent drop in oil prices, weaker wage and job growth all to take into account, inflation could remain subdued in 2026. All that means is simple: potentially more rate cuts in 2026. That in turn could keep the EUR/USD forecast bullish, and the downside limited.\nWhat\u2019s next for the US dollar?\nWell, the economic calendar is going to be fairly light in the remaining days of this year, which could mean limited data-driven volatility for the US dollar and FX markets as a whole. Still, there are a few potentially market moving events to keep an eye on.\n- US Preliminary GDP: This will be release on Tuesday, December 23 at 13:30 GMT, and is the second estimate of Q3 GDP, which came out at 3.8% in the advanced estimate. With CPI cooling more than expected, any signs of growth acceleration could provide goldilocks scenario for risk assets while weakness could hurt the dollar further.\n- ADP Weekly Employment Change: This will be released alongside US GDP, making it a potentially volatile period in the markets. The weekly ADP release is fast becoming a focal employment indicator given its timely release, often a precursor to the monthly ADP and official NFP employment report. Further signs of labour market weakness could bring forward the timing of the Fed\u2019s next potential rate cut in 2026.\n- FOMC meeting minutes: The remainder of US data for 2025 will be released in the last three trading days of the year, starting Monday 29th with Pending Home Sales, followed by weekly ADP and FOMCE minutes on Tuesday 30th and the weekly jobless claims on Wednesday 31st. Among these, the FOMC minutes will be interesting to watch. The Fed cut interest rates as widely expected earlier in December, and investors were encouraged by Powell keeping the door open for more easing in 2026. Since then, slightly stronger employment data has been met with a weaker inflation report. The minutes should give us clearer insights into the FOMC\u2019s forward guidance.\nEUR/USD forecast: Technical analysis and key levels to watch\nFrom a technical standpoint, the EUR/USD forecast remains firmly bullish, despite the recent loss of momentum. Rising moving averages, a short-term uptrend, and a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows all point in the same direction, making it hard to argue for a bearish case at this stage.\nTh"

                "body": "Stock market today: S&P 500 climbs as ongoing AI-led rebound pushes tech higher\nThe EUR/USD pair declined to around 1.1700 after the European Central Bank (ECB) left key interest rates unchanged, a widely anticipated decision that provided little fresh directional impetus for the single currency.\nAs expected, the main refinancing rate was held at 2.15%, with the deposit facility rate unchanged at 2.0%. ECB officials reiterated their commitment to a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach.\nDuring the subsequent press conference, President Christine Lagarde stated that policymakers did not discuss either a rate hike or a cut at this juncture. She emphasised that the ECB does not have a pre-set path for interest rates and, given the prevailing high uncertainty, cannot provide forward guidance on future policy moves.\nIn parallel, the central bank released its latest quarterly economic projections. Growth forecasts were revised upwards to 1.4% for 2025, 1.2% for 2026, and 1.4% for 2027. The inflation outlook for 2026 was also adjusted higher, primarily driven by persistent price pressures in the services sector.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, the pair completed a corrective rebound to 1.1760 and is now forming a downward impulse targeting 1.1706. A break below this level is anticipated, which would set the next local bearish target at 1.1640.\nThis scenario is technically confirmed by the MACD indicator. Its signal line is positioned above zero but is pointing sharply downwards, reflecting sustained bearish momentum and the potential for a further extension of the downtrend.\nH1 Chart:\nOn the H1 chart, the market has finished a first decline to 1.1705, followed by a correction to 1.1755. A second downward impulse towards 1.1705 is currently developing. A clear break below this support would signal the potential for a third wave of decline, targeting the 1.1645 level as a local objective.\nThis outlook is supported by the Stochastic oscillator, whose signal line is below the 50 level and trending firmly downwards.\nConclusion\nThe euro remains range-bound following a largely uneventful ECB meeting, with the central bank\u2019s cautious, data-dependent stance offering little support. The technical structure points to further downside risk, with a break below immediate support at 1.1705 likely to trigger a move towards the 1.1640 area.\nBy RoboForex Analytical Department\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

The pair is on track to close the week with moderate losses, as the US Dollar picks up against its main peers.\nThe Euro (EUR) extended losses on Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates unchanged, as widely expected, and ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to commit to any particular rate path. Lagarde affirmed that the decision was taken unanimously and there was no discussion to change interest rates, suggesting that market speculation about a rate hike is unfounded.\nIn the US, November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) revealed an unexpected decline in inflation, with the year-on-year rate easing to 2.7% from 3.0% in September, as October's reading was cancelled due to the US Government shutdown. The market has taken these figures with caution, and rightly so, as the Commerce Department affirmed that it only collected data from the second half of the month, with the Black Friday sales already in progress.\nOn Friday's US session, the US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the European Commission's Consumer Confidence preliminary survey for December will be the main focus.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Euro eases as the ECB maintains its \"wait-and-see\" stance\n- The Euro is pulling back from recent highs, as investors come to terms with the fact that it is still too early to bet on an ECB rate hike. Downside attempts, however, are likely to remain limited, as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) is seen cutting rates at least two times in 2026.\n- The ECB left its Rate on the Deposit Facility unchanged at 2%, as expected, and revised up its economic growth outlook to 1.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. President Lagarde, however, said that all options are open and that there is no date for any monetary policy move.\n- ECB Board member and Latvian Central Bank Governor Martins Khazakhs reiterated that view on Friday, warning that it is counter-productive to talk about the direction of rates, as the nbank needs \"full optionality, with risks on both sides.\"\n- In the US, CPI figures showed that inflation eased to a 2.7% yearly rate in November, from 3.0% in September, against expectations of a slight increase to 3.1%. Likewise, core inflation moderated to a 2.6% yearly rate from 3% in September.\n- The German GfK Confidence Survey, released on Friday, has shown further deterioration, with January's reading dropping to -26.9 from -23.4 in the previous month, and undershooting market expectations of a -23.2 reading.\n- German Producer Prices Index, also released on Friday, revealed that factory inflation stalled in November, down from a 0.1% rise in October, and contracted at a 2.3% pace in the last 12 months, below the 1.8% decline seen in October and also below the 2.2% contraction forecast by the market consensus.\n- Later in the day, the preliminary Eurozone Consumer Confidence is expected to show a slight improvement to -14.0 in December from -14.2 in November.\n- At the same time, December's US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to be revised up to 53.4 from the 53.3 preli"

The pound hovered around 1.3370, with consumer spending data in the UK falling short of expectations for November.\nInterest Rate Decisions\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates following a 5-4 vote, with Governor Bailey expressing uncertainty over inflation. In contrast, US Fed representatives downplayed the urgency for monetary policy changes. Consumer sentiment in the US rose slightly but fell short of predictions.\nInflation expectations in the US anticipate a 4.2% rise in the short term and 3.2% over five years. The market predicts the Federal Reserve could cut rates by June, with the Bank of England potentially making earlier cuts.\nTechnically, GBP/USD is trending lower with the pair moving towards the 200-day SMA at 1.3350. The RSI indicates strong selling pressure. The British Pound showed strength against the Japanese Yen, but varied against other major currencies.\nIn currency pair changes, GBP has seen varying performance, with the Japanese Yen showing significant weakness across the board. The heat map provides a visual representation of currency percentage changes.\nCurrency Performance Overview\nWe are seeing the British Pound struggle against the US Dollar, trading around the 1.3370 level. This weakness follows disappointing UK retail sales figures, which came in below what analysts expected. The Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to signal imminent rate cuts is also capping any potential gains for the pair.\nThe key factor for the coming weeks is the growing difference between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies. The BoE has already started cutting rates, as we saw with their recent 5-4 vote, signaling concerns about the UK economy. In contrast, Fed officials are indicating they feel no urgency to ease their own policy.\nThis bearish view is supported by the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics, which showed UK retail sales volumes fell by 3.2% last month\u2014the largest drop we\u2019ve seen since the lockdowns of early 2021. Meanwhile, the most recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed core inflation still hovering around 3.8%, giving the Fed reason to maintain its cautious stance. This divergence in economic performance strengthens the case for further Sterling weakness.\nGiven this outlook, derivative traders should consider strategies that profit from a fall in GBP/USD. Buying put options on the Pound or on GBP/USD futures could be a direct way to position for a move towards the 1.3300 level or lower. This approach allows for defined risk while capitalizing on the expected downward momentum in the coming weeks.\nFrom a technical perspective, the break below the 1.3400 level is a significant bearish signal. We are now watching the 200-day moving average around 1.3350 as the next critical support. A similar setup occurred back in late 2022 when aggressive Fed tightening outpaced the BoE, leading to a sustained drop in the pair."

BoE Governor Andrew Bailey opted to support the hawks and added that the interest rate path is uncertain, while highlighting that inflation-persistence data shows positive signs, but risks remain balanced.\nIn the US, New York Fed President John Williams said that some data shows more disinflation, while acknowledging that the \u201cUnemployment rate may have been pushed up by distortions, maybe by a tenth, but not a surprising read.\u201d He added that he does not have the urgency to change monetary policy.\nThe University of Michigan reported on Friday that Consumer Sentiment in December rose below estimates of 53.4, coming at 52.9.

                "body": "Khasay Hashimov | Dec 19, 2025 05:09AM ET\nSterling\u2019s recent price action highlights how quickly domestic data and policy expectations can overwhelm short-lived optimism, particularly when growth momentum remains fragile. The pound briefly firmed after the Bank of England narrowly approved an interest rate cut, a decision that initially encouraged investors to test the downside limits of easing already priced into the currency.\nThat relief rally faded almost immediately as fresh evidence of weak demand reinforced the case for further monetary accommodation. U.K. retail sales fell by 0.1 percent month on month in November, a modest headline decline that nonetheless underscored the broader challenge facing the economy as households remain cautious and real activity struggles to gain traction.\nThe market response was telling. Rather than extending gains, sterling quickly reverted to trading flat near 1.3373 against the dollar, signaling that investors remain unwilling to assign much upside to the currency while the policy outlook points toward lower rates.\nRate differentials continue to work against the pound, especially as other major central banks appear closer to the end of their easing cycles. The euro\u2019s stability around 0.8756 pounds further illustrates this dynamic, as relative policy expectations, rather than short-term data surprises, dominate cross-currency positioning.\nFrom an investor perspective, the key issue is not the single retail sales print, but what it implies for the policy path into 2026. Sluggish consumption suggests that growth remains vulnerable, and if inflation continues to drift closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target in early 2026, pressure will build for additional rate cuts. In that base case, sterling is likely to remain capped, with rallies proving difficult to sustain as investors demand higher yields elsewhere.\nThe risk scenario lies in a sharper slowdown in activity that forces the Bank to accelerate easing, which would reopen downside risks for the currency and potentially push sterling toward weaker trading ranges even without external shocks.\nLooking ahead, investors will focus on incoming growth indicators and inflation trends to gauge how quickly policy expectations are shifting. For now, the message from the market is clear. As long as the U.K. outlook remains fragile and rate differentials point lower, sterling is trading less on optimism and more on restraint, with vulnerability rather than momentum defining its near-term path.\n.\nTrading in financial instruments and/or cryptocurrencies involves high risks including the risk of losing some, or all, of your investment amount, and may not be suitable for all investors.

The pair retains the bearish trend from the 0.6685 highs, with the support area around 0.6600 under pressure.\nThe US Dollar is trading moderately higher against its main peers on Friday, unfazed by the soft US Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figures released on Thursday and investors\u2019 hopes that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates further in 2026.\nData released on Thursday showed that US consumer prices grew at a 2.7% year-on-year pace in November, down from 3% in October, while core inflation slowed to 2.6% from 3% in the previous month.\nTraders skeptical about US CPI data\nInvestors have taken these figures with caution. The Commerce Department announced that data collection began in the second half of the month, when Black Friday sales started, which is highly likely to have distorted the final numbers.\nThe US Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points last week and projected only one more cut in 2026. Investors, however, remain confident that the bank will be forced to trim rates by at least 0.5% to support a deteriorating labor market.\nData released in Australia earlier this week revealed that Consumer inflation expectations increased to 4.7% in December from 4.5% in November. These figures add to the case that the RBA might hike interest rates in the first quarter of 2026, but the impact on the Aussie has been minimal\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is als"

The AUD/USD pair depreciates as the gains ahead of the release of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for December later in the day.\nThe AUD could receive support from investors\u2019 caution following the release of Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations, which rose to 4.7% in December from November\u2019s three-month low of 4.5%, supporting the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) hawkish stance.\nAustralia\u2019s Private Sector Credit rose 0.6% month-over-month (MoM) in November, beating expectations of 0.2% but slowing from October\u2019s 0.7% increase. On an annual basis, credit growth edged up to 7.4% YoY from 7.3%, marking the fastest pace since January 2023.\nUS Dollar gains ground despite Fed rate cut bets\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar (USD) against six major currencies, is gaining ground and trading around 98.50 at the time of writing. However, the Greenback struggled amid rising expectations of US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts following the unexpectedly cooled US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in November.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released on Thursday that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to 2.7% in November. This reading came in below the market consensus of 3.1%. Meanwhile, the US core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6%, missing the expectation of 3.0%. This figure marks the slowest pace since 2021.\n- US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the next chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be someone who believes in lower interest rates \"by a lot.\" Trump further noted that he will soon announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n- Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller, who is under consideration to become chair of the central bank, reiterated his dovish stance on interest rates during a CNBC forum. \u201cBecause inflation is still elevated, we can take our time - there\u2019s no rush to get down. We can steadily bring the policy rate down toward neutral,\u201d Waller said.\n- The CME FedWatch tool shows a 72.3% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, down from 75.6% a day earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has risen to 27.7% from 24.4%.\n- The US November jobs report showed payroll growth of 64K, slightly above forecasts, but October figures were revised sharply lower, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021, underscoring a gradually cooling labor market. Retail sales were flat on the month, reinforcing signs that consumer demand is losing momentum.\n- Fed officials are split over whether more easing of monetary policy is needed next year. The median Fed official penciled in just one reduction in 2026, but some policymakers see no further cuts. Meanwhile, traders anticipate two rate cuts next year.\n- Traders expect the RBA to deliver a rate hike as early as February. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank now expect the RBA to start tightening sooner than previously projected, pointing to stubborn inflation in a capacity-constrained economy. Their forecasts followed the central bank\u2019s hawkish hold on rates at its final 2025 meeting last week.

At the time of writing, USD/JPY is trading around 157.48, up nearly 1.20%, its highest level since November 21.\nEarlier in the Asian session, the BoJ raised its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 0.75%, marking the highest level in roughly three decades. The central bank stated that Japan\u2019s economy has continued to recover at a moderate pace, with tight labor market conditions and solid corporate profits supporting steady wage increases.\nPolicymakers also noted that underlying inflation has been rising gradually, helped by firms passing higher labour costs on to prices, increasing confidence that inflation can be sustained around the 2% price stability target over time.\nHowever, the BoJ also stressed that real interest rates remain significantly negative and that accommodative financial conditions will continue to support the economy. The central bank said it will continue to adjust policy in line with developments in economic activity, prices, and financial conditions, signalling a cautious approach to further tightening.\nIn reaction to the rate hike, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields moved higher, with the 10-year JGB yield rising above 2.0%, its highest level since 1999. Higher yields have renewed concerns about Japan\u2019s large public debt, as rising interest rates could gradually lift government debt-servicing costs.\nMeanwhile, Japanese authorities reiterated their focus on currency market developments. The central bank said it will pay close attention to movements in financial and foreign exchange markets as part of its ongoing policy assessment. Separately, Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Friday that authorities would take appropriate action against excessive foreign exchange moves.\nA steady US Dollar is also weighing on the Yen, although expectations of further monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit further gains in the Greenback.\nData released on Friday showed softer US consumer sentiment, with the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Expectations Index revised down to 54.6 from 55.0, while the headline Consumer Sentiment Index was finalised at 52.9. On the inflation side, one-year consumer inflation expectations edged up to 4.2%, while the five-year outlook remained unchanged at 3.2%.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation.

Japan\u2019s economy is recovering moderately, with tight labour markets and robust corporate profits supporting consistent wage increases.\nInflation And Interest Rate Outlook\nUnderlying inflation is gradually rising, with firms passing higher labour costs to prices, potentially sustaining inflation around the 2% target. The BoJ noted Japan\u2019s significantly negative real interest rates and intends to continue accommodative conditions, emphasising a cautious approach to further tightening.\nJapanese Government Bond yields rose above 2.0%, the highest since 1999, raising concerns about Japan\u2019s large public debt. Authorities remain vigilant over currency market developments, possibly intervening against excessive forex movements.\nA steady US Dollar and expectation of further Federal Reserve monetary policy easing also impact the Yen. US consumer sentiment showed a slight decline, with the Consumer Expectations Index revised to 54.6 and inflation expectations at 4.2% for one year.\nThe BoJ\u2019s monetary policy, focusing on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing, has led to the Yen\u2019s depreciation, affecting its value against major currency peers. The BoJ\u2019s decision to unwind its ultra-loose policy is driven by rising inflation and salary prospects in Japan.\nInterest Rate Differential And Market Impact\nThe Bank of Japan just raised its interest rate to 0.75%, yet we saw the Yen weaken and USD/JPY push to a one-month high around 157.48. This happened because the central bank signaled it will be very cautious about any future hikes. The market is interpreting this as a \u201cdovish hike,\u201d meaning the interest rate differential with the US will remain wide for the foreseeable future.\nThis large interest rate gap continues to make the carry trade highly attractive. With the US Federal Reserve\u2019s key rate holding around 4.5%, borrowing in Yen to buy Dollars still offers a substantial yield. As long as this differential persists, the fundamental pressure on the Yen will be downwards, supporting a higher USD/JPY.\nHowever, we need to be extremely wary of intervention from Japanese authorities as we approach the 160 level. Looking back, we saw significant official intervention in the spring and summer of 2024 when the Yen weakened past that point. The Ministry of Finance has already stated it will act against \u201cexcessive moves,\u201d so any rapid ascent from here carries significant risk of a sharp reversal.\nTraders should therefore consider options strategies to manage this risk in the coming weeks. Buying short-dated out-of-the-money puts on USD/JPY could offer a cheap hedge against a sudden intervention-driven drop. This allows for participation in further upside from the carry trade while capping potential losses from a sharp pullback.\nOn the US side, a slightly weaker outlook could temper the dollar\u2019s strength. The latest University of Michigan data showed consumer sentiment dipping, and the CME FedWatch Tool is currently pricing in a greater than 65% chance of a Fed rate cut by March 2026. This potential for US easing might limit how high USD/JPY can go, creating more of a grind higher rather than a breakout.\nGiven Japan\u2019s November core inflation came in at a modest 2.1%, the BoJ is unlikely to turn aggressive soon, despite solid wage growth seen earlier in the 2025 \u201cShunto\u201d negotiations. This reinforces the view that the carry trade will remain the dominant theme. We should expect the pair to keep testing highs, but with volatility increasing as it enters the zone where officials have historically stepped in."

A preliminary estimate points to a 1.2% rebound in November, which likely kept markets from panicking about growth. Desjardins said spending looks flat so far in Q4 \u2013 soft, but not weak enough to force an immediate policy shift. That fits a Bank of Canada that\u2019s signaling it\u2019s in wait-and-see mode after earlier easing, with traders taking their cues from global rates more than local data.\n**Why should I ca..\nre?**\nFor markets: Oil and yields are steering the loonie.\nThe currency stayed in a tight recent range, suggesting traders are treating Canadian data surprises as second-order. Crude oil\u2019s bounce matters because energy exports are a big support for Canada\u2019s trade balance. At the same time, Canadian yields have been following global bonds higher, which can lift the loonie by widening rate differentials even if the BoC sits still.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks are redrawing the rate playbook.\nBig moves abroad can spill into Canada fast, especially through currency and funding markets. When Japan or the US shifts expectations, global yields reprice \u2013 and that can tighten financial conditions in smaller open economies without any local policy change. Add in commodity swings tied to geopolitics, and Canada\u2019s outlook can hinge as much on external shocks as on domestic spending.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "USD/CAD remains trapped within a narrow range due to mixed US data and weaker Canadian Retail Sales. The pair trades close to 1.3784, following a rebound after hitting an intraday low around 1.3755 as the US Dollar gains strength.\nUS data showed a mixed performance, with Existing Home Sales increasing by 0.5% in November, down from the 1.5% rise in October. Consumer sentiment weakened slightly, with the University of Michigan revising its Consumer Expectations Index to 54.6, below both the preliminary and forecast estimates.\nInflation Expectations Rise\nInflation expectations edged up, with one-year expectations rising to 4.2%, exceeding preliminary and market forecasts. The US Dollar Index reached 98.70, its highest since December 11, aiming for its first weekly increase in three weeks.\nCanadian data offered little support to the Loonie as Retail Sales dropped by 0.2% in October, missing expectations. Core Retail Sales declined by 0.6%, disappointing forecasts of a 0.2% rise.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s policy and the US Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook create a support base for the Canadian Dollar, possibly limiting gains in USD/CAD. New York Fed President John Williams highlighted this by discussing current policy and future adjustments.\nThe Canadian Dollar\u2019s value is influenced by factors such as interest rates, Oil prices, economic health, and inflation. These metrics affect global confidence and, in turn, the currency\u2019s strength.\nMarket Dynamics Affect Dollar Strength\nWe see USD/CAD struggling for direction, currently trading around 1.3784. The recent drop in Canadian retail sales confirms a slowdown, a trend reinforced by the weak November employment report that showed a net job loss of 10,000. This data points to a softer Canadian economy heading into 2026.\nOn the US side, the picture is also mixed, keeping the pair locked in place. While the Dollar Index has found some footing near 98.70, last week\u2019s Consumer Price Index reading for November came in at 3.0%, slightly below expectations. This cooler inflation reading fuels the belief that the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates next year.\nThe key tension for us is the differing paths of the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. Canada\u2019s latest inflation report this week surprised with a sticky 3.3% reading, suggesting the BoC may need to stay on hold longer than previously thought. This contrasts with the US situation and is likely what\u2019s preventing a major breakout above 1.3800 for now.\nWe also have to consider the price of oil, which is a major driver for the Canadian dollar. West Texas Intermediate crude has been soft, trading near $72 a barrel amid concerns about slowing global demand. This acts as a headwind for the loonie, limiting its strength even with Canada\u2019s relatively high inflation.\nFor derivative traders, this stable range presents an opportunity. Selling options through strategies like short strangles could be attractive to collect premium, betting that the pair remains between key support and resistance levels through the year\u2019s end. We are watching for a potential increase in volatility, which could make buying options for a breakout a better play in the new year."

                "body": "USD/CAD remains range-bound amid mixed US data and softer Canadian Retail Sales\n- USD/CAD stays confined to a narrow range amid a steadier US Dollar.\n- US data show softer consumer sentiment alongside steady inflation expectations.\n- Weak Canadian Retail Sales weigh on the Loonie after both headline and core readings missed expectations\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) trades little changed against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, as a rebound in the Greenback keeps USD/CAD confined within its week-old range. At the time of writing, the pair is trading around 1.3784, recovering slightly after dipping to an intraday low near 1.3755.\nThe US Dollar holds firm despite a mixed batch of US economic data released earlier in the day. Existing Home Sales rose by 0.5% MoM in November, slowing from October\u2019s 1.5% increase.\nMeanwhile, the University of Michigan\u2019s final December survey showed a modest easing in sentiment. The Consumer Expectations Index was revised down to 54.6 from the preliminary estimate of 55.0, coming in below the market forecast of 55.0. The headline Consumer Sentiment Index was finalised at 52.9, slightly below both the earlier estimate of 53.4 and the forecast of 53.3.\nOn the inflation front, the University of Michigan\u2019s final December survey showed a modest uptick in short-term inflation expectations. One-year consumer inflation expectations rose to 4.2%, above both the preliminary estimate and the market forecast of 4.1%. Longer-term inflation expectations, however, were unchanged, with the five-year outlook holding steady at 3.2%, in line with both the earlier estimate and market expectations.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, trades around 98.70, its highest level since December 11, extending its rebound after briefly dipping below 98.00 to its weakest level in over two months. The index is on track to post its first weekly gain in three weeks.\nOn the Canadian side, domestic data offered little support to the Loonie. Statistics Canada reported that Retail Sales fell by 0.2% MoM in October, missing market expectations for a flat reading and reversing September\u2019s sharp 0.9% decline.\nCore Retail Sales, which exclude autos, fell by 0.6% MoM in October, coming in weaker than the market forecast of a 0.2% increase and reversing September\u2019s modest 0.1% gain.\nBeyond the data, diverging monetary policy outlooks between the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve continue to provide underlying support to the Loonie, potentially limiting upside in USD/CAD. Expectations for further monetary policy easing by the Fed next year may cap US Dollar gains, even as short-term rebounds persist.\nSpeaking in a CNBC interview, New York Fed President John Williams said policy remains mildly restrictive and still has room to move toward neutral, which he sees as slightly below 1% in real terms. Williams added that he sees no urgency to change the current policy stance and noted that recent data have not altered his broader outlook.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be p"

                "body": "Consumer confidence in the Netherlands stood at -21 in December, indicating concerns about economic conditions. This data point underscores perceptions of the economic situation from a consumer perspective.\nThe US Dollar Index has increased above 98.50, preceding the University of Michigan survey data. Concurrently, the NZD/USD pair dropped to near 0.5750 after upbeat GDP figures failed to boost the Kiwi.\nGbp Jpy Reaches New Highs\nThe GBP/JPY reached new highs above 209.00 due to persistent upward momentum. In contrast, UK retail sales declined by 0.1% in November, against an expected 0.4% increase.\nThe Japanese Yen continues to weaken following comments from the Bank of Japan Governor Ueda. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD has seen a dip towards 1.1700 amid fresh demand for the US Dollar.\nThe GBP/USD remains steady below 1.3400 as traders process updates from the Bank of England and recent US inflation reports. Gold prices have stayed weak, trading below $4,350, despite mixed US CPI data indicating cooling inflation pressures.\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are experiencing ongoing corrections, influenced by the Bank of Japan\u2019s rate decision impacting market sentiment. The Bank of England\u2019s recent rate cut to 3.75% reflects a hawkish stance, slightly strengthening the sterling. Ethereum\u2019s growing state issues are prompting the EF to suggest various solutions to manage potential centralization risks.\nDutch Consumer Confidence And Eurozone Weakness\nThe reported Dutch consumer confidence figure of -21 for December confirms a worrying trend of weakness within the Eurozone. We\u2019ve seen similar softness in recent data, such as the November S&P Global Eurozone Composite PMI which came in at a contractionary 48.2. This suggests that any rallies in European equities are likely to be short-lived, making put options on indices like the Euro Stoxx 50 an attractive hedging strategy for the coming weeks.\nThis European weakness creates a stark contrast with the relative stability of the US economy, which is fueling the US Dollar Index\u2019s push above 98.50. Looking back, the November 2025 Non-Farm Payrolls report showed a solid addition of 195,000 jobs, supporting the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to hold rates firm while others are cutting. We believe trading USD call options or bull call spreads offers a clear way to position for continued dollar dominance against a basket of weaker currencies.\nThe direct fallout from this divergence is visible in the EUR/USD pair, which is sliding toward 1.1700. Given the persistently negative sentiment from the continent, we see this as the path of least resistance heading into the new year. For traders, this presents an opportunity to buy put options on the Euro, providing a defined-risk method to capitalize on further declines.\nMeanwhile, the GBP/JPY cross hitting fresh highs above 209.00 is a story about interest rate differentials, not fundamental UK strength. With the Bank of England\u2019s rate at 3.75% following its recent cut and the Bank of Japan\u2019s rate still near zero, traders are simply borrowing cheap yen to buy higher-yielding sterling. However, this carry trade is crowded and vulnerable, so we advise using long-dated call options to maintain exposure while strictly defining the potential loss.\nThe slide in cryptocurrencies alongside a hawkish tone from the Bank of Japan points to a broader risk-off mood in the market. As we approach the end of the year, a period historically known for thin liquidity, this nervousness could easily translate into higher volatility. We think buying VIX futures or call options is a prudent move to protect portfolios from any sudden market shocks."

The dollar to yen rate rises to 156.23, putting a test of the 2025 high at 157.89 on the cards for the coming days and weeks.\n\"The statement is not hawkish enough for the market, and USD/JPY was sent higher. The Board has not upgraded its assessment of the economy and still sees some weakness in parts,\" says Valentin Marinov, Head of G10 FX Strategy at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\nThe yen is clearly under pressure, and for it to turn direction, the BoJ will need to signal it is committed to raising interest rates further. However, the central bank stuck to its cautious tone and did not offer much forward guidance.\nHowever, there were some snippets to embolden JPY bulls: the accompanying statement reiterated that it intends to keep increasing the policy rate if its economic outlook is realised.\nThe BoJ also noted that the chances of that happening are increasing, citing that underlying inflation is continuing to rise moderately."

                "body": "United States total net Treasury International Capital (TIC) flows fell sharply in October. The figure dropped from $190.1 billion to a negative $37.3 billion, indicating a reverse in capital inflows.\nIn related economic activities, the Japanese Yen decreased on intraday trading following a Bank of Japan interest rate hike. Gold prices continued to fall despite hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut amid cooling US inflation.\nInterest Rate Impacts on Currency Pairs\nThe EUR/JPY gained value as the Bank of Japan increased interest rates to 0.75%. The GBP/JPY also rose beyond mid-208.00s after the Bank of Japan\u2019s 25 basis points rate hike.\nThe market witnessed a decline in the price of WTI, struggling below $56.00. This occurred amidst suggestions of a potential peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.\nThe Australian Dollar maintained its position, supported by a hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia policy outlook. Meanwhile, Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency held support at $1.82, although low retail demand remained an issue.\nTop losers in the crypto market included Pump.fun, Pudgy Penguins, and Hyperliquid. They all showed double-digit losses amidst a surprise drop in the November US Consumer Price Index to 2.7%.\nEconomic Indicators and Investment Strategies\nThe sharp reversal in U.S. capital flows for October 2025, from a $190.1 billion inflow to a $37.3 billion outflow, is a significant warning sign. This indicates that foreign investors are selling U.S. assets, a trend which, if it continued into November and December, could put serious pressure on the dollar. We believe derivative traders should consider positions that benefit from dollar weakness, such as buying puts on the dollar index or calls on currency pairs like EUR/USD.\nWith U.S. inflation cooling to 2.7% in November, which was below market expectations, the case for Federal Reserve rate cuts in early 2026 is getting stronger. Historically, markets move well ahead of the Fed\u2019s actual decisions, a pattern we saw repeatedly in late 2023 and early 2024. Therefore, positioning in interest rate futures that bet on a lower federal funds rate by the second quarter of 2026 could be a prudent strategy.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s rate hike seems to have been fully priced in, leading to the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d reaction we are now seeing in the yen\u2019s weakness. This predictable outcome makes yen-funded carry trades attractive again, where one borrows in a low-interest currency to invest in a higher-yielding one. Selling yen futures or buying call options on pairs like GBP/JPY, which is already trading strongly, appears to be the logical move for the coming weeks.\nGold\u2019s slide below $4,350 is counterintuitive given the dovish inflation data, but it points to heavy profit-taking and liquidation by short-term traders. This may present a buying opportunity for those with a slightly longer view, as the fundamental environment of pending rate cuts remains supportive for non-yielding assets. We see this as a temporary dislocation, making long-dated call options on gold an interesting play on an eventual rebound.\nIn energy markets, crude oil struggling below $56 per barrel is a direct result of geopolitical developments rather than just supply and demand fundamentals. A potential peace deal in Ukraine would remove the significant risk premium that has been embedded in oil prices since the conflict escalated in the early 2020s. Traders should be prepared for further downside, as a formal agreement could trigger a rapid sell-off toward the $50 level, making puts on WTI futures a timely hedge."

The new framework enables banks to demonstrate custody through legal arrangements, rather than direct possession of private keys, a move that has sparked debate and concerns about investor safety.\nHere, I, Akiyama Felix, a member of the Crypto Class of 2018 and key observer of US regulatory developments, will break down the matter.\nWhat Does This SEC Change Actually Mean for Holding Bitcoin?\nThink of crypto custody like the deed to your house. Previously, regulators had a very strict \u201csafe harbor\u201d rule. This rule required firms to prove they physically held the keys to your crypto, much like holding the actual deed.\nThe SEC has now withdrawn this stricter guidance. In its place, an updated FAQ suggests broker-dealers can establish \u201ccontrol\u201d through other means, such as complex legal agreements with third-party custodians. Chairman Paul Atkins\u2019 \u201cProject Crypto\u201d and the SAB 122 rescission in January 2025 are the real reasons this is happening.\nIn simple terms, they can now legally be your crypto\u2019s guardian through paperwork, without necessarily holding the keys in their own vault.\nFor those of us who lived through the 2022 contagion, the SEC\u2019s shift back toward \u2018paper-based control\u2019 feels like a retreat from the very transparency that blockchain was supposed to provide.\nThis follows a trend of regulators trying to fit digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. Earlier this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed that U.S. banks can offer crypto custody, signaling a wider acceptance of Wall Street\u2019s role in the market.\nDISCOVER: 16+ New and Upcoming Binance Listings in 2025\nWhy Should You Care About Custody Rules?\nThis rule change creates a smoother path for large, traditional financial firms to offer crypto services, which could boost Wall Street Krypto-Fonds and institutional adoption. For these firms, managing crypto within existing legal structures is more efficient and less operationally complex than building new systems for direct key management.\nBut here\u2019s the risk for you:\nIt blurs the lines of ownership. When a bank holds your assets under these new, flexible rules, your crypto could be treated as part of the bank\u2019s assets in a bankruptcy. This is precisely what happened to customers of failed exchanges like FTX, where user funds weren\u2019t properly segregated. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 12 implications for \u201cControllable Electronic Records\u201d are the legal bridge these banks are using. The SEC has repeatedly warned that many crypto platforms are not \u201cqualified custodians,\u201d as reported by CNBC.\nWhile working with a regulated bank sounds safe, this change removes a critical protection that ensured your assets were treated as yours and yours alone. The risk of Private-Key-Sicherheit und Risiken has not disappeared; it has just been moved into a different legal structure.\nIs This Good or Bad for Crypto?\nThe argument in favor is that this decision lowers the barrier for major financial players to enter the crypto market, potentially bringing trillions in new capital. It treats Bitcoin and Ethereum held by market makers as \u201creadily marketable,\u201d which makes it cheaper and easier for them to support products like Bitcoin ETFs.\nHowever, it also represents a trade-off. It prioritizes convenience for institutions over the fundamental principle of direct asset ownership for individuals. For beginners, it\u2019s more important than ever to understand the difference between buying crypto through a traditional broker and holding it yourself in a private wallet.\nThis rule change is a clear signal that Wall Street is integrating crypto on its own terms, not on"

                "body": "In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, Curve Finance has solidified its position as a powerful force, now claiming a whopping 44% of Ethereum DEX fees. This impressive feat showcases its unique approach to liquidity management but also raises doubts about the sustainability of its dominance in the crypto banking space. In this discussion, we\u2019ll delve into how Curve\u2019s sustainable revenue models set a new standard in DeFi. We\u2019ll look at the potential drawbacks of monopolization and examine the lessons decentralized organizations can glean from its triumphs.\nCurve Finance's Dominance in Ethereum DEX Fees\nCurve Finance has captured a 44% fee share in Ethereum DEX transactions, solidifying its status as a leader in stablecoin and BTC liquidity. This achievement is a testament to the integration of crvUSD and Yield Basis, which has further strengthened its market position. Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve, has been at the forefront of creating sustainable revenue models. The project\u2019s innovations are backed by Yield Basis, which helps reduce impermanent loss, making Curve a reliable option for DeFi participants.\nThe Dangers of Market Monopolization in Crypto\nWith Curve\u2019s fee dominance comes greater trust in stablecoin trading on Ethereum, but it also brings with it concerns about systemic risks. The concentration of liquidity and governance can create significant vulnerabilities in the DeFi ecosystem. For example, high concentrations of CRV as collateral could lead to forced liquidations that affect lending protocols, causing systemic risk. Moreover, low on-chain liquidity for CRV and feedback loops between price drops and liquidations could amplify losses, potentially resulting in endogenous crashes.\nSustainable Revenue Models and Their Role in Business Crypto Payments\nCurve\u2019s commitment to sustainable revenue models highlights the necessity of transparent economics and real yield. By focusing on low-slippage swaps for pegged assets, Curve lowers trading costs and enhances capital efficiency. This methodology not only benefits individual users but also serves as a guideline for businesses seeking to integrate cryptocurrency payments. Consider European SMEs; they can utilize Curve\u2019s fee-sharing and liquidity incentives to decrease payment costs and monetize treasury crypto holdings through stablecoin yield strategies.\nInsights for DAOs and Startups from Curve Finance\u2019s Stablecoin Integration\nThe strategies that Curve employs in stablecoin integration and liquidity management provide invaluable insights for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and startups. By adopting niche-focused liquidity pools, DAOs can allocate resources to high-efficiency use cases, attracting liquidity providers while mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Moreover, time-locked governance tokens can be utilized to prioritize sustained participation over fleeting speculation, directing incentives to areas with critical liquidity needs.\nSummary: The Prospects of Crypto Payroll and Treasury Management\nAs Curve Finance cements its role in the DeFi world, its sustainable revenue models and innovative tactics are poised to reshape the future of crypto payroll and treasury management. By acknowledging the risks tied to market monopolization and embracing best practices from Curve, businesses and DAOs can adeptly navigate the intricate landscape of the crypto realm while maximizing their growth and stability potential. The horizon for decentralized finance appears promising, with Curve Finance leading the charge."

                "body": "Zug, Switzerland, December 19th, 2025, FinanceWire\nEthereum\u2019s market is one of the most competitive corners of DeFi, and it has virtually no \"meme\"-driven trading activity. This makes it easier to measure the more organic market volumes, where low fees and the trading of core assets such as ETH, BTC (wrapped), and stablecoins are predominant.\nThis week, Curve Finance delivered one of the clearest signals that it stands among the top players in this scene.\nTop Ethereum DEXs by fees (30-day view, DeFiLlama)\nAccording to DeFiLlama\u2019s data, Curve now ranks among the top Ethereum DEXs in terms of fees metrics over the past 30 days, overtaking other long-standing leaders in the space.\nOne thing that is particularly notable here is how much the scale has shifted. Around this time last year, Curve accounted for roughly 1.6% of all DEX fees charged on Ethereum. Today, its share stands at about 44%, marking the most significant overturn in fee dominance that DeFi has seen in 2025.\nThese figures highlight rising trader activity and fees paid by users on Curve. But it should be noted that this is not a reflection of profit or yield distributed among liquidity providers or the protocol itself.\nThere are several factors that drove this growth. Trading activity around Curve\u2019s native crvUSD stablecoin has increased sharply, pushing volumes higher and reinforcing the protocol\u2019s position as a core venue for on-chain stablecoin liquidity. By trading volume (24H), crvUSD has moved into the top 5 stablecoins, superseded only by major leaders like USDT and USDC. This reflects its rapid adoption and growing role in on-chain liquidity.\nTop stablecoins by trading volume (24H) (CryptoRank.io)\nAt the same time, integration with Yield Basis has concentrated the largest on-chain Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi on Curve, with the protocol now hosting three of the deepest on-chain BTC liquidity pools used by Yield Basis protocol. The pools rank at the very top by both TVL and depth, well ahead of BTC pools on other DEXs.\nHere\u2019s how Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, has commented on this shift: \u201cDeFi users are increasingly prioritising sustainable revenue models over short-term speculation. We\u2019re seeing a clear move away from hype-driven trading and towards protocols with transparent economics and real yield. This change in long-term behaviour is reshaping where liquidity and volume ultimately settle.\u201d\nAbout Curve Finance\nCurve Finance is one of the largest DeFi protocols, specializing in stablecoin trading with minimal fees and slippage. Launched in 2020, it has grown into a full ecosystem with liquidity pools, lending markets, its own stablecoin (crvUSD), and DAO governance, becoming a key infrastructure layer for Ethereum and other EVM networks."

This wave followed on the heels of the late 2024 rise of BONK, which boosted memecoin activity after some arbitrage traders appeared to be chasing the token airdrop given to every Solana mobile owner.\nThis feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list.\nBy early 2025, the memecoin trend exploded further as the memecoin named for \u2014 and financially tied to \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump (TRUMP) flooded X and Solana\u2019s trading apps. The momentum, which was part humor, part community spectacle, helped push Solana into the mainstream narrative once again. (The TRUMP token eventually collapsed and is down 87% from its all-time high.)\nShortly thereafter, the memecoin mania hit a turning point by February after a massive international scandal (unveiled by CoinDesk) revealed that the LIBRA token\u2019s co-creator Hayden Davis bribed Argentinian President Javier Milei\u2019s sister and close advisor to convince Milei to promote the token on social media, bringing the entire memecoin ecosystem into a cooling-off phase.\nIn the background of the LIBRA chaos, Solana\u2019s developer ecosystem pressed forward with tangible innovation. The Solana Mobile team rolled out its second-generation crypto phone, the Seeker, designed specifically for onchain trading and Web3 usage. With built-in wallet integration, a dApp store, and DeFi support, the Seeker reflected Solana\u2019s goal to merge crypto functionality with consumer tech, expanding accessibility and usability for both traders and developers.\nLooking ahead, the much-anticipated Alpenglow upgrade looms large. Expected to reduce transaction finality to sub-second speeds while cutting validator costs, Alpenglow could dramatically improve scalability and reliability. With nearly unanimous community approval, it\u2019s set to cement Solana\u2019s position as one of crypto\u2019s most performant and developer-driven ecosystems.\nFrom memecoin mayhem to real hardware innovation and cutting-edge upgrades, Solana\u2019s 2025 has proven that its builders and its culture continue to keep its ecosystem in crypto\u2019s cultural zeitgeist.\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines.

While Tron becomes the most profitable decentralized finance (DeFi) chain, it has also solidified its position as a stablecoin powerhouse.\nTron Leads in Monthly Revenue\nData from DeFiLlama showed a spike in onchain transaction fees this week. According to the details, Tron surpassed other blockchains in terms of network revenue.\nThe income generated by the blockchain network from transaction fees paid by users flipped those of Solana and BSC.\nWithin the past 24 hours, Tron accumulated total revenues of $1.12 million. This pushed the monthly generated income to $29.63 million.\nSolana came second with 24-hour revenues of $542,314 and monthly fees of $18.21 million. Following behind is BSC with daily and monthly transaction fees of $454,140 and $13.24 million, respectively.\nThe huge revenue gap between these crypto assets signaled the strong ecosystem activities that occurred on the Tron network.\nThis suggests several users, developers, and decentralized applications (dApps) prefer operating on Tron compared to others.\nAccordingly, the Tron blockchain saw high usage and demand for TRX, which led to a surge in network revenue.\nIt is important to note that the recent attention to Tron followed the drop in the price of Bitcoin (BTC).\nTRX experienced the highest dominance among the top cryptocurrencies, while the BTC dominance declined. In the first week of November, TRX dominance jumped from a weekly low of 0.76% to 0.81%.\nTron Positions as a Stablecoin Powerhouse\nIn addition to Tron rising to become the most profitable DeFi chain, the blockchain continues to demonstrate its strength as a stablecoin powerhouse.\nDeFi research known as SeniorDeFi on X emphasized that Tron is the leading network for stablecoin transaction volume.\nRather than focusing on complex financial protocols, Tron has carved out a niche as the top network for handling stablecoin transactions globally.\nThis dominance stems primarily from the massive adoption of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin.\nData from DeFiLlama shows Tron hosts more than half of its total supply, exceeding $80 billion as of December 2025.\nNotably, in late October, the number of daily active addresses on Tron climbed to 5.7 million, amid growing stablecoin activity. This surpassed the previous day\u2019s record of 5.4 million.\nAt its core, Tron stands out for its simplicity and low transaction costs. This makes it ideal for individuals in developing regions facing inflation or currency instability.\nAdditionally, Tron has consistently maintained a high Total Value Locked (TVL) and daily transaction count.\nThis consistency positions the blockchain as a robust backbone for remittances and payment rails for financial inclusion in underserved areas.\nRevolut Integrates with Tron for In-App TRX Staking\nIn a related development, Tron has announced a new partnership with Revolut, a fintech company in Europe. Revolut is one of the largest fintech platforms in Europe with over 65 million global customers.\nThrough the partnership with Tron, Revolut users can now stake TRX directly within the Revolut app.\nRevolut charges 0% platform fee on staking rewards. However, a small on-chain validator fee may apply via third-party validators.\nAlso, the integration leverages Tron\u2019s dominance in stablecoin volume. Revolut users receive fast, low-cost cross-border remittances using Tron-based stablecoins, with near-instant settlement and minimal fees.\nFurthermore, Revolut enables seamless, spread-free conversions between traditional currencies and stablecoins on the Tron blockchain.\nThis makes it easi"

                "body": "Despite its crowd of very persistent holders, Cardano (ADA +3.98%) only has a market cap of $13.8 billion, making it a lot smaller than even Dogecoin, (DOGE +4.54%) with $20 billion, as well as larger chains like Solana, (SOL +3.23%) which has a cap of $71.3 billion. Perhaps surprisingly, I predict that this state of affairs will remain largely the same through the end of 2026, with both Dogecoin and Solana continuing to maintain or even dramatically expand their lead over Cardano.\nLet's talk about why these contenders are likely to keep standing in roughly the same places on a relative basis through 2026.\nDogecoin could stay above Cardano without being a buy\nFor some investors, Dogecoin's edge over Cardano may seem strange. After all, it's just a meme coin, and Cardano is an entire smart contract blockchain with its own (limited) decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and community of application developers. But the dog-themed coin has a couple of benefits the more serious asset lacks, at least for now.\nIn particular, as of late November, Dogecoin now has U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that let people buy exposure through ordinary brokerage accounts. While some spot Cardano ETFs are being considered for approval, presently Cardano doesn't have any active ones, so it can't get capital inflows from the same sources, thereby limiting its size.\nCRYPTO: ADA\nKey Data Points\nETFs can make capital a bit stickier than you would expect for a meme coin, because it lowers onboarding friction and turns buying into a quick button press instead of a complicated system of setting up crypto wallets and funding them. And Cardano can build more and ship more, and still lose that particular fight if investors keep preferring the easiest path for exposure.\nBut none of this adds up to a reason to invest in Dogecoin, and there isn't really an investment thesis for holding it in general.\nCRYPTO: DOGE\nKey Data Points\nSolana's lead over Cardano could increase\nWhereas Dogecoin's advantage over Cardano is in its distribution, Solana's is in having better distribution, plus more capital and more efficient technology.\nIn crypto, the chains that host the most usable liquidity (capital) tend to keep winning, because liquidity attracts developers, and when developers make apps that people want to use, they then attract more liquidity. Solana has about $8.7 billion in DeFi total value locked (TVL), and about $15.7 billion in stablecoins parked on the chain. Cardano only has $180 million in DeFi TVL, and about $38 million in stablecoins outstanding -- a negligible sum that isn't sufficient to support any big expansions of its ecosystem activity. So even if Cardano were to suddenly become the home of a killer decentralized application (dApp) that led its DeFi TVL and stablecoin base to increase 10 times overnight, which certainly will not occur, it would still be trailing very far behind Solana.\nCRYPTO: SOL\nKey Data Points\nSpeed and cost advantages held by Solana are more likely to reinforce that situation rather than lead to it equalizing over time. On Dec. 15, Solana was handling about 1,155 transactions per second (TPS) on its chain, versus around 0.7 TPS for Cardano, with average transaction fees near $0.0075 for Solana versus about $0.134 for Cardano, and block processing times of about 0.4 seconds versus about 20 seconds with Cardano. So Solana's throughput is vastly higher, its costs are much lower, and it's dramatically faster than Cardano, too. That's far too many huge gaps for the smaller network to overcome before the end of 2026, or even 2028.\nCardano could keep improving, and there is a chance it closes some of the technical gap over the long run -- if it continues to limp along. The harder part is closing the capital gap, because liquidity is social as much as it is technical, and it takes time to persuade users to relocate. And right now, the only real relocation is capital and users flowing from Cardano to Solana."

                "body": "FTSE 100 and sterling rise after Bank of England rate cut\nStock prices in London closed in the green on Thursday, following the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut rates and a hold from the European Central Bank.\nIn a split vote, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted five to four to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points, which takes the bank rate to 3.75% from 4%.\nFive members of the MPC, including Governor Andrew Bailey, supported the cut, judging that upside risks to inflation have continued to recede.\nAJ Bell\u2019s Laith Khalaf said: \u201cA Christmas rate cut will bring some much-needed financial cheer to households and businesses across the country, especially those who are battling to keep the show on the road.\n\u201cBut there were definite signs of hawkishness in the minutes of the MPC meeting.\u201d\nMr Khalaf added: \u201cInflation is now expected to fall back closer to the 2% target in the spring\u2026 But this has failed to significantly move the dial for some members of the rate-setting committee.\n\u201cThe vote to cut rates was still close, with four members wanting to hold rates at 4%\u2026That suggests they may be worried about a U-shaped trajectory for (consumer price inflation), settling at a rate above 2% in the medium term.\u201d\nThe analyst concluded: \u201cAll in all, the rhetoric and tone of the committee\u2019s minutes look pitched at restraining animal spirits. Despite the rate cut, the Bank remains in cautious mode, wary of both persistent inflation and policy errors.\u201d\nThe FTSE 100 index closed up 63.45 points, 0.7%, at 9,837.77. The FTSE 250 ended up 160.83 points, 0.7%, at 22,325.59, and the AIM All-Share closed up 4.88 points, 0.7%, at 756.36.\nIn European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed up 0.8%.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday left interest rates unchanged, as expected, amid a brighter economic forecast.\nThe decision leaves the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 2%, 2.15% and 2.4% respectively.\nRead More\nQuilter Cheviot\u2019s Richard Carter said: \u201cThe ECB\u2019s decision to maintain its hold on rates comes as a surprise to no one, and 2026 looks likely to be similarly uneventful unless there is a significant shift in the economic outlook.\n\u201cMost economists expect rates to remain unchanged throughout next year, particularly after Christine Lagarde reaffirmed her confidence that current monetary policy is well-positioned.\n\u201cWhile a rate cut cannot be entirely ruled out if inflation continues to surprise on the upside, any movement is likely to be minimal for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nThe pound was quoted higher at 1.3387 dollars at the time of the London equities close on Thursday, compared to 1.3359 dollars on Wednesday. It had bought 1.3356 dollars just before the Bank\u2019s rate decision.\nThe euro stood at 1.1730 dollars, lower against 1.1749 dollars. Against the yen, the dollar was trading lower at 155.46 yen compared to 155.55 yen.\nStocks in New York were higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 index up 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.9%.\nThe yield on the US 10-year Treasury was quoted at 4.11%, narrowing from 4.17%. The yield on the US 30-year Treasury was quoted at 4.79%, narrowing from 4.83%.\nBrent oil was quoted higher at 60.23 dollars a barrel at the time of the London equities close on Thursday, from 59.91 dollars late on Wednesday.\nGold was quoted higher at 4,370.61 dollars an ounce against 4,326.25 dollars.\nBack on the London Stock Exchange, Whitbread led the FTSE 100, up 6% after activist investor Corvex Management LP took a more than 6% stake in the Bedfordshire, England-based hotel and restaurant owner.\nCorvex said the Premier Inn owner trades at a discount not only to its \u201cfundamental value\u201d but at a discount to the value of its UK freehold hotel portfolio alone, and urged Whitbread to commission a third-party strategic review of its capital allocation priorities.\nIn response, a Whitbread spokesperson "

The UK also benefitted from the BOE rate cut.\nOn the day:\n- German DAX +0.4%\n- France's CAC +0.3%\n- UK's FTSE 100 +0.7%\n- Spain's Ibex +0.45%\n- Italy's FTSE MIB +0.7%\nOn the week:\n- German DAX +0.4%\n- France's CAC +1.3%\n- UK's FTSE 100 +2.6%\n- Spain's Ibex +2.0%\n- Italy's FTSE MIB +2.8%\nEveryone talks about American exceptionalism, but look at the scoreboard. The S&P 500 is having a solid year (up ~16%), but it's getting lapped by Madrid and Milan.\nLooking back on the year so far:\nIBEX 35: The absolute star of the show. Up 48.36% YTD and adding another 2.06% this week alone. Breaking 17,000 is a massive psychological win.\nFTSE MIB: Not far behind, sitting on a 30.91% YTD gain and up 2.85% this week.\nDAX : The industrial engine is humming, up 22.01% YTD.\nFTSE 100: Even the FTSE is joining the 20% club, up 21.12% YTD and finding late-year momentum (+2.59% WTD).\nCAC 40 The laggard of the group, but still holding double-digit gains at +10.72% YTD.\nIf that looks good, keep in mind that the euro is up 13% year-to-date so those returns in US dollars are significantly amplified. I highlighted earlier how there are challenges for Europe in the year ahead as the ECB has moved to the sidelines. The ECB growth assumptions are on the optimistic side and the inflation problem hasn't gone away, particularly in services.\nThe thing is, Europe is still very cheap and the market is increasingly looking for shelter away from the AI trade."

                "body": "Josh Safdie\u2019s hectic new film \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d set in 1952, mainly in New York, is, essentially, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d but with a happy ending. That recklessly exuberant 2019 drama, which Safdie co-directed with his brother, Benny, stars Adam Sandler as a jewelry dealer in Manhattan and a compulsive gambler who takes thrilling risks to pay off his creditors and learns that the house always wins. With \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d\u2014Safdie\u2019s first feature directed without Benny since 2008\u2014the happy ending follows logically from a happy beginning, so to speak. The film\u2019s first scene features a tryst, in a back room of a shoe store, between the protagonist, a twenty-three-year-old salesman named Marty Mauser (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), and a young married woman named Rachel (Odessa A\u2019zion).\nBut Marty\u2019s greater happiness involves another secret, one that he\u2019s scheming to spring on the world: that he, a Ping-Pong hustler who plays locally for modest stakes, is about to prove, in an international table-tennis tournament in London, that he\u2019s the best in the world. For a scuffling guy from the Lower East Side, it\u2019s a tall order; nonetheless, with his irrepressible energy and his wiles, he gets out of his low-rent neighborhood and into ever-wilder exploits that, in the story\u2019s eight-month span, fling him about and leave him changed\u2014perhaps even for the better.\nMarty\u2019s chutzpah is justified by history; the character is loosely based on the table-tennis hustler and champion Marty Reisman, who died in 2012, at the age of eighty-two. Like Marty, Reisman came from the Lower East Side and travelled overseas in 1952 for an international tournament. Other details, freely tweaked, mesh, too, but the main similarities are in temperament\u2014a megawatt personality and a penchant for braggadocio.\nUnlike Sandler\u2019s gambler in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Marty bets on no one but himself. It isn\u2019t easy for Marty, who lives with his emotionally and financially dependent mother (Fran Drescher), to fund the trip to London: it takes ruses and threats and some outmaneuvering of his boss, his doting but tough uncle Murray (the writer Larry Sloman). So, once Marty gets there, he has to make the most of it. He finds the competition stiffer than he expected\u2014especially from a Japanese player (the real-life table-tennis star Koto Kawaguchi), who uses a new kind of paddle and grip. But what matters even more than winning any one match is to get into the spotlight and into the higher echelons of society, since, to launch an international career, Marty needs rich backers\u2014and, in any case, he craves fame and the trappings of success. Bulldozing his way into a suite at the Ritz, Marty focusses his impudent charm on a glamorous former movie star, Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow), and also ingratiates himself with her husband, a wealthy businessman named Milton Rockwell (the entrepreneur, politician, and \u201cShark Tank\u201d judge Kevin O\u2019Leary) with an eye for publicity and, as he says, a nose for bullshit.\nWhile there, Marty also partners with a Hungarian former champion, who survived Auschwitz (G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig, who played an Auschwitz inmate in \u201cSon of Saul\u201d), in a table-tennis stunt duo. His relationship with Rachel, who works at a pet shop and has a lumpish husband, Ira (Emory Cohen), tightens\u2014or, rather, she tightens it, with a ruse of her own. Then Marty faces a quandary, akin to the money emergency that screeches like a siren through \u201cUncut Gems\u201d: hit with a fine by the table-tennis commissioner (the writer Pico Iyer) for boorish behavior in London, and left with little time to pay it off in order to enter a tournament in Tokyo, he starts Ping-Pong hustling again, in the company of a cabdriver friend named Wally (the rapper Tyler, the Creator). The result is a whirlwind of chaos that involves such out-of-control elements as a gangster (the filmmaker Abel Ferrara), a dog, a car crash, a break-in, a shoot-out, a fire, a flood, another affair, and a display of public defiance so brazen that it risks becoming an international inci"

The pair were engaged at the time of their breakup in 2024, and Trump, 47, wasted no time in going public with his new girlfriend, Bettina Anderson, 39.\nAccording to People, Guilfoyle, 56, has \u201cmajor concerns\u201d about her ex\u2019s new relationship. A source told the outlet, \u201cKimberly knows Don well and they\u2019re still great friends, but she has major concerns when it comes to his relationship with Bettina.\u201d\n\u201cThe engagement was difficult for Kimberly to see and she felt it only added to her doubts about the relationship.\u201d\nThe source continued, \u201cShe only wants the best for Don, but she isn\u2019t convinced Bettina is well-suited for Don or that what they have is the real deal.\u201d\n\u201cKimberly has a hard time seeing the headlines about their relationship because she doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s built to last.\u201d\nThe source also told People that Guilfoyle is concerned that Anderson is \u201cmore interested in the prestige and attention that comes with being connected to the Trump family\u201d and that she would not be in a relationship with Trump without it.\nTrump announced his engagement to Anderson at his father\u2019s Christmas reception at the White House on Monday night.\nIn a video posted to social media by far-right provocateur Laura Loomer, Trump addressed the crowd, flanked by his fianc\u00e9e and father.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that I\u2019m at a loss for words \u2019cause we usually do the ranting and raving really well,\u201d Trump Jr. told guests.\nHe went on to thank Anderson\u2014\u201cfor that one word, yes\u201c\u2014before describing his nervousness prior to the proposal.\n\u201cWhen you go down there, it\u2019s like, you\u2019re gonna go, and you\u2019re trying to ask, and you\u2019re not sure what the answer\u2019s gonna be. It\u2019s always a little bit rough. But she said yes, which is a big win for the end of the year,\u201d he said.\nTrump was previously married to Vanessa Kay Haydon for 13 years. The couple had five children together. Guilfoyle and Trump began dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2020 before splitting in 2024 after news of Trump\u2019s new relationship broke.\nGuilyole was confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Greece in September, having been nominated by President Donald Trump to the role in December 2024.\n\u201cI am profoundly grateful to President Trump and the U.S. Senate for their trust and confidence in me. It is the honor of my life to serve as the first female Ambassador of the United States to Greece,\u201d Guilfoyle wrote in a social media post following her successful confirmation."

                "body": "JPY News Today: Bank of Japan Lifts Rates, Market Reactions on Dec 20\nOn December 20, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) made a historic move by lifting its benchmark rates to the highest level seen in three decades. This significant adjustment marks a strategic shift towards policy normalization amidst persistent inflation concerns. The immediate consequences included sharp movements in the Japanese yen, impacting global trading dynamics. As BoJ signals a new monetary phase, investors are closely observing the ripple effects across different markets.\nBank of Japan\u2019s Rate Hike: What It Means\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to increase its interest rates is a strategic move aimed at curbing rising inflation. By raising rates, the BoJ intends to influence borrowing costs, thereby controlling consumption and investment in the economy. This rate hike is the highest in 30 years, signaling a clear pivot from a prolonged period of uber-accommodative policy. The central bank\u2019s actions are expected to reshape not only Japan\u2019s economic landscape but also influence global investment trends.\nImpact on the Japanese Yen\nThe Japanese yen reacted swiftly to the rate hike announcement. Increased interest rates often make a currency more attractive, drawing international investors seeking higher returns. As a result, the yen gained strength against major currencies. On December 20, the yen\u2019s performance underscored this reaction, attracting interest from forex traders. For local businesses and exporters, a stronger yen could mean increased challenges in international markets as their goods become more expensive abroad.\nNikkei Index Response and Market Dynamics\nThe Nikkei index (^N225) experienced notable volatility following the announcement of the rate hike. Initially, concerns over tighter monetary conditions led to a brief dip. However, by the day\u2019s close, the index rose by 1.03%, ending at 49,507.21. This reflects investor optimism over the economic adjustments. Analysts highlight that such a response may indicate confidence in Japan\u2019s economic resilience despite tighter policies.\nJGB Yield Increase and Investor Sentiment\nJapanese Government Bonds (JGBs) saw yields increase immediately following the rate hike. Higher rates typically lead to increased yields, making bonds more appealing investment avenues. As investors recalibrate their portfolios, the rise in JGB yields indicates expectations for more lucrative returns in a changing rate environment. This movement in yields is crucial for international bond investors focused on balancing risk and reward amid global uncertainties.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s rate hike is a pivotal moment in its policy trajectory. By raising rates, Japan signals a proactive stance on inflation, departing from decades of low-interest regimes. The immediate impact is visible in the strengthened Japanese yen and a responsive stock market, particularly the Nikkei index. JGB yields have also adjusted to new levels, reflecting investor sentiment. As investors monitor global impacts, these developments portray a recalibration of Japan\u2019s monetary policy. For real-time updates and financial forecasts, platforms like Meyka can offer critical insights through AI-driven analytics.\nFAQs\nThe rate hike increased the Japanese yen\u2019s appeal to investors, leading to a stronger currency. This can attract forex traders but may challenge exporters as it makes Japanese goods pricier internationally.\nThe Nikkei index initially dipped but later rose by 1.03% on December 20, closing at 49,507.21. This suggests investor confidence in Japan\u2019s economic resilience amid tighter monetary policies.\nRising JGB yields post rate hike make these bonds more attractive due to higher potential returns. Investors may recalibrate portfolios to accommodate these changes, balancing risk and reward.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational purposes.

                "body": "The Bank of Japan raised interest rates to a three-decade high on Friday and signalled more policy tightening. The rate hike was widely expected.\nIt caused the yield of Japan\u2019s 10-year government bonds (JGBs) to jump to a 26-year peak. But, the yen quickly reversed an initial knee-jerk rise and fell as much as 0.7% to 156.71 per US dollar by 0754 GMT, shortly after BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s post-meeting news conference ended.\nThe Nikkei share average, which finished trading right before Ueda began speaking, ended the day up 1% at 49,507.21, led by artificial intelligence-linked stocks after US peers rallied overnight following blowout forecasts from chipmaker Micron. The broader Topix climbed 0.8% to 3,383.66.\nALSO SEE: China\u2019s Bytedance Signs JV Deal on Operation of TikTok in US\nThe 10-year JGB yield extended earlier gains, rising as much as 5.5 basis points to 2.02%, its highest since August 1999, following the central bank\u2019s policy announcement. The 2% level had long served as a symbolic ceiling during Japan\u2019s decades-long battle with deflation.\nThe BOJ raised short-term interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% in the first increase since January. The central bank said there was a \u201chigh chance\u201d for a virtuous cycle of rises in wages and inflation to be sustained.\n\u2018Moving away from cautious stance\u2019\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway for me so far is that the BOJ has moved significantly away from the cautious stance it took previously,\u201d said David Chao, global market strategist for Asia Pacific at Invesco.\nAt the same time, \u201cthe long-held belief that rate hikes would give the currency a boost has yet to materialise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BOJ\u2019s gradual tightening \u2026 coupled with wide interest rate differentials and falling market volatility, could continue to keep the JPY weak.\u201d\nAt the press conference, Ueda took his familiar measured, cautious tone, particularly on the neutral interest rate, which neither stimulates nor hampers economic growth. Traders had been keen for comments on the neutral rate to try and judge the terminal rate for this hiking cycle.\n\u201cOur estimate on Japan\u2019s neutral rate sits on a pretty wide range. It\u2019s hard to set a pinpoint estimate,\u201d Ueda said.\n\u201cAll I can say is that our future policy decision depends on the information that will become available at the time.\u201d\nThe two-year JGB yield, which tends to be the most sensitive to monetary policy expectations, climbed as much as 3 bps to 1.095%, the highest since a record peak of 1.1% in June 2007.\nThe five-year yield added 5.5 bps to 1.485%, a level last seen in June 2008.\nAt the longer end, 20-year yields gained 3.5 bps to a record 2.97%. The 30-year yield climbed 4 bps to 3.415%.\nSo-called super-long yields began their current climb in early November as market speculation intensified over the potential size and shape of a stimulus package under the new government of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\nInitially, signs that the administration would pressure the BOJ to hold off on rate hikes to support the economy kept shorter-term yields pinned down, but Ueda triggered the biggest bond market selling for four months in early December when he sent a strong signal for an imminent rate hike, and hinted he had Takaichi\u2019s consent.\nThe 10-year yield sat around 1.65% at the end of October.\nTakaichi has billed her fiscal policy as \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d, but investors worry about a wave of new debt issuance.\nMUFG buys 20% stake in Shriram Finance\nMeanwhile, in other business news from Japan, MUFG Bank will acquire a 20% stake in Shriram Finance Ltd (SFL) for $4.4 billion, the Indian non-bank lender said on Friday.\nThat is the largest cross-border investment in India\u2019s financial sector and MUFG\u2019s largest investment in India to date. It surpasses existing commitments of $1.7 billion in a sector that has struck deals worth nearly $15 billion so far this year, according to Dealogic data, more than double the $6.5 billion done in 2024.\nThe deal comes close on the heels of Emirates NBD Bank\u2019s "
