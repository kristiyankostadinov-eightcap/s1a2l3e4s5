It stayed within a fairly flat range until the end of August, when it launched higher once again, breaking US$4,300 in mid-October.\nThe price of gold took a breather following that move, even falling briefly below US$4,000; however, its retracement was neither as steep nor as long as many market watchers expected it to be.\nGold began gaining steam again in mid-November, and took off again in earnest at the end of 2025.\nIn 2026, precious metals have continued to benefit from geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Expectations of interest rate cuts after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends later this year have provided support too. Trump\u2019s feud with the Fed over rates took an eyebrow-raising turn on January 9, when the US Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas targeting Powell with a criminal indictment.\nSilver also posted a fresh high of US$94.88 per ounce on Monday.\nThis latest upswing for the precious metals comes as investors moved out of global stocks following Trump\u2019s threats over the weekend that the European nations opposing his bid to acquire Greenland will face 10 percent tariffs starting February 1. That figure could rise to 25 percent if a deal to secure Greenland for the US is not reached by June.\nThe nations targeted by the new tariffs include France, Germany, the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland. The news has prompted fears of a full-blown US-Europe trade war, a weaker US dollar, higher inflation and a worsening outlook for the global economy. There are even concerns the conflict over Greenland could seriously weaken or dismantle the NATO alliance. Gold is traditionally used as a hedge against such risks.\nGreenland's key geographic position in the Arctic has long been coveted by the United States as a necessary strategic asset in its geopolitical struggle with Russia and China. \u201cChina and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \u201cOnly the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!\u201d\n\"Gold\u2019s sharp response to tariff-related headlines highlights how market sentiment has shifted away from a narrow focus on growth or inflation, toward policy uncertainty as a primary driver. Tariffs do not only disrupt trade flows; they also pose spillover risks to supply chains, corporate margins, and medium-term growth expectations,\" Linh Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said in a market note shared with the Investing News Network (INN).\n\"As soon as the probability of escalation increases, defensive capital tends to move preemptively, rather than waiting for tangible impacts to materialize in economic data. In this context, gold functions as a portfolio risk-balancing asset.\"\nEuropean leaders have responded with vows that they will not be blackmailed into allowing Trump to take Greenland, and are now preparing counter measures to the president's tariffs.\n\"The most realistic option would be for Europe to strike back using the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument, a legal framework that allows the EU to respond collectively when a third cou"

Both Cook and recent Fed Chair Jerome Powell have argued that this was exactly the real motive behind Trump\u2019s attempt to fire her and his threat to bring criminal charges against Powell.\nAnalysts note that this clause has never before been tested in court. If the requirement is strict enough, it could affirm the Fed\u2019s independence, but it might also become a target for creative government attacks.\nFormer Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said: \u201cThe door is open, and the question is how to resolve this issue so that people in the president\u2019s office can\u2019t just decide, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want that person, so I\u2019ll accuse them of something, and that's enough.\u2019\u201d\nJudicial Process Developments and Controversy\nCook believes that\u2019s exactly what Trump did in August 2025. At that time, based on allegations that she provided false information on a home mortgage application, Trump said he would fire her, even though her Fed term runs through 2038\u2014far beyond his presidential term. No charges have yet been filed, no financial institution has accused her of fraud, and no administrative proceedings have been initiated.\nShe filed suit, and a lower court ruled she could remain in her position pending a hearing\u2014very different from the outcome when Trump tried to reshape other ostensibly independent agencies. His administration has appealed.\nThe Trump team\u2019s main argument is that \u201ccause\u201d is whatever the president says it is\u2014a standard that would leave Fed governors just one step away from being dismissed \u201cat will.\u201d\nIt is reported that\nPowell will attend the Supreme Court\u2019s hearing on the Cook case this Wednesday\n.\nExperts\u2019 Concerns About Independence\nJon Faust, former senior adviser to Powell and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, now an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said that given the Supreme Court\u2019s support for the Trump administration on many other issues, he fears that even if Cook stays, the outcome could weaken the Fed\u2019s independence from political pressure.\nFaust said: \u201cI think the likelihood of establishing a strict and difficult-to-surmount barrier is very low. There are many possible justifications for a decision in (Cook\u2019s) favor... The battle will continue, Trump will continue to attack, and if he chooses to use every tool... independence is very likely to collapse.

The central question is whether the justices will shield the Fed from political influence as intended by Congress or allow U.S. President Donald Trump to freely remove officials at his discretion.\nThe case\u2014centered on Trump's attempt to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud\u2014could erode the Fed\u2019s independence in extreme scenarios. Even if it falls short of that outcome, it may still provide the first roadmap for how a president can remove members of a deeply independent central bank governing body.\nLegal Challenge to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Independence\nEven if Cook retains her position\u2014as many legal analysts predict given the Supreme Court's previous statements on the Fed\u2014the conservative-leaning court could still explain why Trump's removal attempt fails and clarify what constitutes 'just cause' for dismissing a monetary policymaker.\nThis requirement, established under the Federal Reserve Act, aims to protect Federal Reserve governors (including its leadership) from being removed due to disputes over interest rates. Both Cook and recent Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have argued that this was the true motive behind Trump's attempt to remove her and his threat to bring criminal charges against Powell.\nAnalysts note that this provision has never been tested in court before. If stringent enough, it could reaffirm the Fed\u2019s independence but might also become a target for creative government attacks.\nFormer Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said, 'The door is open.

No charges have been filed, no financial institution has accused her of fraud, and no administrative proceedings have been initiated.\nShe filed a lawsuit, and a lower court ruled that she could remain in her position pending a hearing\u2014a stark contrast to the outcomes seen when Trump attempted to reshape other ostensibly independent institutions. His administration has appealed the decision.\nThe argument from Trump's team essentially boils down to the notion that 'reason' is whatever the president says it is, a standard that seems to place Federal Reserve governors just one step away from being arbitrarily dismissed.\nIt is reported that Jerome Powell will attend the Supreme Court hearing on the Cook case this Wednesday.\nExperts' Concerns About Independence\nJon Faust, former senior advisor to both Jerome Powell and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, and now an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, expressed concern that even if Cook prevails, the outcome could still undermine the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence from political pressure, given the Supreme Court's support for the Trump administration on many other issues.\nFaust said, \"I think the likelihood of imposing a strict and difficult-to-pass barrier is extremely low. There are many compelling arguments for Cook to win the ruling\u2026 The battle will continue, and Trump will keep launching attacks. If he chooses to use all means available\u2026 the independence is highly likely to collapse. I believe we already know where things are headed.\"\nHowever, others remain hopeful.\nKathryn Judge, a professor at Columbia Law School, stated: \"It appears they will indeed attempt to find some kind of exception that allows the Federal Reserve to maintain its independence.\"\n\"But for this independence to truly function effective"

                "body": "Gold & Silver Price Forecast: Will Gains Continue?\nTracking the Forces Behind Precious Metals as Investors Weigh Momentum, Risks, and the Road Ahead\nAn in-depth look at the forces shaping precious metal prices and what investors should watch next.\nGold and silver have once again captured the spotlight in global financial markets. After a period of strong gains punctuated by sharp pullbacks, investors are asking a familiar but pressing question: will the rally in gold and silver prices continue, or are the markets approaching another turning point? Understanding the outlook for these precious metals requires a close look at macroeconomic trends, monetary policy, geopolitical risks, and shifting investor behavior.\nA Strong Start, But With Volatility\nOver the past year, both gold and silver have benefited from a combination of economic uncertainty and renewed interest in hard assets. Gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven investment, has found support amid persistent inflation concerns, slowing global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions. Silver, often described as gold\u2019s more volatile cousin, has followed a similar upward path but with sharper swings, reflecting its dual role as both a precious and industrial metal.\nWhile prices have climbed, the journey has not been smooth. Periodic sell-offs have occurred whenever the U.S. dollar strengthened or bond yields rose. These corrections, however, have so far been viewed by many investors as healthy pauses rather than the end of the broader uptrend.\nThe Role of Interest Rates and Central Banks\nOne of the most important drivers for gold and silver prices remains monetary policy. Precious metals tend to perform well when interest rates are low or expected to fall, as they do not yield interest and therefore compete more effectively with bonds in such environments.\nMarkets are closely watching signals from major central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve. If policymakers pivot toward rate cuts to support slowing economic growth, gold and silver could see renewed momentum. Conversely, if inflation proves stubborn and forces central banks to keep rates higher for longer, upward pressure on yields could limit further gains in the near term.\nThat said, central bank demand for gold has become a powerful structural factor. Many countries have been increasing their gold reserves as a way to diversify away from traditional reserve currencies. This steady, price-insensitive demand provides a long-term tailwind for gold and, indirectly, supports broader interest in precious metals.\nInflation, Currency Trends, and the Dollar Factor\nInflation expectations continue to play a key role in shaping price forecasts. Gold is widely regarded as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Even when headline inflation moderates, concerns about long-term purchasing power can keep investors allocated to gold.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar is another critical variable. A stronger dollar typically weighs on gold and silver prices, making them more expensive for buyers using other currencies. However, any signs of dollar weakness, whether due to fiscal concerns, trade imbalances, or shifts in global capital flows, could act as a catalyst for higher precious metal prices.\nSilver, while influenced by the same currency dynamics, also reacts strongly to changes in industrial demand. This makes its price outlook more complex but also potentially more rewarding during periods of economic recovery.\nIndustrial Demand and the Silver Outlook\nSilver\u2019s unique position as both an investment asset and an industrial metal sets it apart from gold. Demand from sectors such as electronics, solar energy, electric vehicles, and medical technology has been growing steadily. The global push toward renewable energy and electrification has significantly increased silver\u2019s importance in manufacturing.\nIf global economic activity stabilizes or accelerates, industrial demand could provide a strong boost to silv"

It also buys cargoes on the spot markets and refines domestically produced oil.\nMRPL is actively weighing the opportunity to buy Venezuelan crude oil if the commercial terms, including freight rates, are favorable, the executive said.\nIndia\u2019s top private refiner, Reliance Industries, earlier this month said it would consider buying Venezuelan crude again if sales are permitted to non-U.S. buyers.\nThe scouring of Venezuelan crude by Indian refiners shows how quickly global oil trade patterns are being reshuffled after the United States moved to allow limited Venezuelan exports following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\nVitol and Trafigura are offering Venezuelan crude to refiners in China and India for March delivery, trade sources told Reuters last week, days after two of the world\u2019s biggest independent oil traders obtained special U.S. licenses to help market Venezuela\u2019s oil.\nAt the request of the US government, Trafigura and Vitol are providing logistical and marketing services to facilitate the sale of Venezuelan oil, Trafigura said on January 9, following a meeting of oil industry executives with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House.\nVitol, the world\u2019s biggest independent oil trader, has approached Indian state-controlled refiners to offer the crude at a discount of $8-$8.50 per barrel versus ICE Brent on a delivered basis, one of the sources told Reuters.\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nTsvetana is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing for news outlets such as iNVEZZ and SeeNews."

                "body": "Pipeline and isolation specialist STATS Group has launched the SureTap Plug, a dual seal completion plug engineered to maintain Double Block and Bleed (DBB) isolation in hot tapping and line stopping\nSTATS\u2019 innovative approach fundamentally changes completion plug design by introducing true double block and bleed capability to the final stage of hot tapping operations and addresses long-standing completion safety concerns, while improving operational efficiency across the entire hot tapping workflow.\nThe new technology addresses a vulnerability at the final stage of hot tapping operations, where conventional completion plugs rely on a single O-ring seal that cannot be tested or verified under modern DBB safety criteria before temporary valves are removed.\nWhile operators routinely establish fully tested DBB isolation during hot tapping and line stopping, that protection is typically not available at completion of the hot tap fitting. The inability to confirm seal integrity under modern DBB safety criteria or independently validate plug positioning has led to serious safety incidents in the pipeline industry.\nThe SureTap Plug is designed to eliminate this risk by introducing true DBB capability at completion. The plug features two independent compression seals with a testable intermediate annulus, allowing operators to verify both seal integrity and validate/correct plug positioning before removing temporary valves.\nThe hydraulically actuated plug incorporates multiple mechanical fail-safes. Sealing performance is significantly improved over conventional O-ring designs due to the seal profile and increased surface contact area, providing reliable isolation even on imperfect fitting flange inner diameters damaged during hot tapping operations.\nThe SureTap Plug is available in size range: 6\" to 56\", covering the majority of hot tapping applications. It meets IMCA double block and bleed requirements for subsea diver safety and is suitable for use on hydrocarbons, hydrogen and high-pressure liquid CO\u2082 piping systems.\nIn addition to enhanced safety, the SureTap Plug offers practical operational benefits including a reduced diameter design which allows flow around the plug during deployment, eliminating the need for bypass check valves.\nSeals are protected during insertion and can pass through standard valve bores, while an optional dedicated hydraulic launcher allows hot tap machines to be demobilised earlier, reducing equipment hire time and costs.\nWith a minimum 25-year design life, the SureTap Plug is also suitable for permanent abandonment applications on aging assets.\nAngus Bowie, STATS Group chief technology officer, said, \u201cOperators invest in robust double block and bleed isolation during hot tapping and line stopping, only to accept a single, unverifiable barrier at completion. This contradiction has persisted because no alternative existed - until now.\n\u201cThis verification eliminates the manual error causing mis-alignment or issues from external locking mechanisms guesswork that has plagued completion procedures for decades. Operators can now confirm, with tested certainty, that their pressure barrier is secure before exposing personnel to risk.\u201d"

The strong start comes despite the sector facing pressure from ample supply, but getting a boost from ongoing geopolitical pressures.\nBrent prices have increased from $59.96 per barrel two weeks ago to $64.15 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday as Iran tensions increase market jitters. U.S. President Donald Trump has softened his rhetoric of imminent military action in Iran in recent days, with military action on the OPEC member threatening to disrupt up to 3.3M bbl/day of oil production. According to ING analysts, the risk of U.S. military action in Iran \"remains significant, keeping the market nervous in the short term. However, the longer this goes on without any U.S. intervention, the risk premium will continue to fade, allowing more bearish fundamentals to dominate.\" And now there are growing signs that low oil prices will force some U.S.producers to curtail production. Shale drilling pioneer Continental Resources has suspended drilling in North Dakota's Bakken shale for the first time in decades, with billionaire founder Harold Hamm decrying low oil prices, \"This will be the first time in over 30 years that Harold Hamm has not had an operation with drilling rigs in North Dakota,\" Hamm told Bloomberg in an interview. \"There's no need to drill it when margins are basically gone.\u2019\u2019\nRelated: Strike, Privatization Push Raise Fresh Risks for Peru\u2019s Oil Sector\nAccording to BloombergNEF, the Bakken is viewed as a bellwether for the U.S. shale sector, with the basin currently having a breakeven price of $58/bbl to cover costs. The Oklahoma City-based company is shifting its attention to Argentina, and recently bought assets from Argentina\u2019s Pan American Energy in its push into the Vaca Muerta shale basin, \u201cVaca Muerta is one of the most compelling shale plays in the world,\u201d Continental President and Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler said in a statement.\nContinental Resources will probably not be the last producer to cut drilling in the U.S. shale basin. U.S. oil output is projected to decline slightly in 2026 due to lower oil prices that reduce drilling incentives, slowing activity even as technology improves. Lower prices make some wells uneconomical, leading companies to scale back drilling, with gains in areas like the Permian Basin unable to fully offset losses elsewhere.\nSeveral energy analysts and banks have forecast U.S. oil prices (WTI) to average below $60 per barrel in 2026, driven by a significant global oversupply as production outpaces demand, with some projections seeing prices dip even lower, potentially towards the mid-$50s or even lower during the year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, driven by production exceeding demand, leading to inventory builds averaging around 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2026, putting downward pressure on crude prices as supply growth outpaces demand growth. Meanwhile, the buildup of oil in transit and floating storage suggests market participants are storing oil, expecting lower near-term prices, which is typical in a contango market structure.\nOn a brighter note, China is expected to continue its strategic and commercial stockpiling of crude oil well into 2026, driven by energy security concerns and the need to hedge against geopolitical risks, such as U.S. sanctions. China is actively expanding its storage capacity, with plans to add 11 new oil reserve sites between 2025 and 2026, creating space for approximately 169 million additional barrels.\nA new Energy Law enacted by Beijing last year codifies strategic storage requirements for both state-owned and private companies, transforming the reserve system into a formal, long-term instrument for economic and national security.

The S&P 500 Energy Sector has advanced 6.8% so far, ranking third among all sectors, trailing only Industrials (7.6%) and Materials (7.2%). This positive performance comes despite abundant supply weighing on the sector, with ongoing geopolitical tensions providing a supportive backdrop.\nBrent crude has climbed from $59.96 per barrel two weeks ago to $64.15 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, as escalating tensions with Iran unsettle the market. Although U.S. President Donald Trump has recently toned down talk of immediate military action, the threat of conflict with the OPEC nation could disrupt as much as 3.3 million barrels per day of oil output. Analysts at ING note that the risk of U.S. intervention in Iran remains elevated, keeping markets on edge in the near term. However, if military action is avoided, risk premiums could diminish and bearish fundamentals may take precedence.\nThere are increasing indications that persistently low oil prices are prompting some American producers to scale back. Shale industry leader Continental Resources has halted drilling in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale for the first time in decades. Founder Harold Hamm cited unsustainably low prices, telling Bloomberg in an interview that, \u201cFor the first time in over 30 years, I won\u2019t have drilling rigs operating in North Dakota. There\u2019s little reason to drill when profit margins have disappeared.\u201d\nRelated: Labor Strikes and Privatization Efforts Heighten Risks for Peru\u2019s Oil Industry\nBloombergNEF considers the Bakken formation a key indicator for the broader U.S. shale sector, with current breakeven costs estimated at $58 per barrel. Continental Resources, based in Oklahoma City, is now redirecting its focus to Argentina, having recently acquired assets from Pan American Energy to expand into the Vaca Muerta shale. \u201cVaca Muerta stands out as one of the world\u2019s most attractive shale opportunities,\u201d said Continental\u2019s President and CEO Doug Lawler.\nContinental\u2019s move may signal a broader trend, as other U.S. producers could also reduce drilling activity. Projections indicate a modest dip in American oil output in 2026, as lower prices dampen drilling incentives and technological improvements are unable to fully compensate. While the Permian Basin may see gains, they are unlikely to offset declines elsewhere, as many wells become unprofitable at current prices.\nNumerous energy experts and financial institutions predict that U.S. crude (WTI) will average below $60 per barrel in 2026, citing a persistent global surplus as production continues to outpace demand. Some forecasts even anticipate prices dropping into the mid-$50s or lower during the year, as highlighted in this analysis. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global oil inventories to keep expanding throughout 2026, with supply exceeding demand and stockpiles growing by an average of 2.8 million barrels per day. This oversupply is likely to exert further downward pressure on prices. Additionally, the accumulation of oil in transit and floating storage points to market participants anticipating lower prices ahead, a pattern typical of a contango market.\nOn a more optimistic note, China is projected to maintain its aggressive crude oil stockpiling strategy through 2026, motivated by energy security and the desire to hedge against geopolitical uncertainties, including U.S. sanctions. The country is expanding its storage infrastructure, with plans to add 11 new reserve sites between 2025 and 2026, accommodating an additional 169 million barrels.\nBeijing\u2019s new Energy Law, enacted last year, formalizes strategic storage requirements for both state and private entities, making reserves a central pillar of national economic and security policy. While the pace of stockpiling may slow until new facilities are operational, China remains committed to building reserves sufficient to cover up to 180 days of imports.\nMeanwhile, ren"

                "body": "EUR/USD (6E) at a Crossroad: Will Macro Forces Break the Range or Reinforce the Balance?\nEURUSD Stalls at Range Extremes as Macro Forces Drive Two Way Risk\nThe EURUSD remains one of the most actively traded currency pairs globally, acting as a real time barometer for relative growth, inflation, and monetary policy expectations between the United States and the Eurozone. As we move along in 2026, the market finds itself at an important inflection point, with price still operating inside a well defined higher time frame distribution range. Understanding the macro backdrop alongside current market structure is essential for framing expectations in the weeks ahead.\nMacro Factors Influencing EURUSD\nRecent sentiment in EURUSD has been shaped primarily by diverging economic narratives between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In the United States, economic data has remained resilient, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending. This has kept the Fed cautious about signaling aggressive rate cuts, even as inflation shows signs of gradual moderation. Higher for longer rate expectations continue to underpin the US dollar, especially during periods of global risk aversion.\nIn contrast, the Eurozone faces slower growth dynamics, with manufacturing activity and business confidence remaining fragile in several core economies. While inflation has cooled meaningfully, the ECB has been more vocal about the need to support growth, leaving markets sensitive to any hint of accelerated easing. Headline risk remains elevated around ECB policy meetings, US CPI and employment releases, geopolitical developments, and energy related shocks that disproportionately impact Europe. Any surprise in relative rate expectations or risk sentiment can quickly translate into directional movement for EURUSD.\nWhat the Market Has Done\n- The market has been in a distribution range between 1.18 and 1.148 since June 2025, signaling balance at the higher time frame rather than sustained trend continuation.\n- Since the start of 2026, sellers have consistently responded from the 1.18 area, reinforcing it as a key supply zone within the broader range.\n- In the past month, price has developed a downtrend structure on the lower timeframe, with lower highs and lower lows.\n- EURUSD is currently trading below the Composite Volume Point of Control (CVPOC).\n- Rotations have remained rotational rather than impulsive, reinforcing the idea of auction behavior rather than trend expansion.\nWhat to Expect in the Coming Weeks\nKey levels to watch remain 1.18 and 1.148, which define the upper and lower boundaries of the broader distribution range.\nNeutral Scenario\n- Expect price to remain contained within the 1.18 and 1.148 range as the market continues to digest macro uncertainty.\n- In the near term, the market may auction lower toward the 1.148 CLVN 1 area.\n- Responsive buyers are expected to defend this zone and attempt to rotate price back up through the range, keeping conditions balanced.\nBearish Scenario\n- If buyers are unable to defend the 1.148 area, the auction is likely to extend lower.\n- In this case, price may rotate down toward the 2026 yearly VWAP, where an initial buying response can be expected.\n- Failure to attract meaningful demand at VWAP would open the door for continuation toward 1.122, identified as CLVN 2.\nBullish Scenario\n- If buyers respond aggressively and are able to bid price back above 1.165, which aligns with the CVPOC, upside momentum could rebuild.\n- A sustained acceptance above this level would increase the probability of a move back toward 1.18.\n- If sellers fail to defend the upper boundary, the market could print an imbalance above the consolidation range and extend higher toward the 1.200 area.\nConclusion\nEURUSD remains a market defined by balance at the higher time frame, even as near term price action reflects persistent pressure from macro forces favoring the US dollar. Ongoing resilience in US economic data, cautious Fed"

At the time of writing, EUR/USD trades around 1.1648, up nearly 0.40% on the day and snapping a four-day losing streak.\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that a 10% tariff would be imposed from February 1 on eight European nations, including Denmark, Germany, France, the UK, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Finland. He added that the tariff would rise to 25% in June unless and until \"a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland\".\nThe move has reignited fears of a broader transatlantic trade conflict, with the threat of retaliatory measures rattling investor confidence and triggering a fresh risk-off wave across global markets.\nGerman Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said countermeasures are available and must be prepared, while EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis warned that US tariff threats are \u201cnot acceptable,\u201d adding that the European Union has tools at its disposal and that \u201cnothing is off the table.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron has also urged the bloc to activate the EU\u2019s \u201canti-coercion instrument.\u201d\nThe Euro is also drawing support from steady inflation data out of the Eurozone. Figures released earlier in the day showed that the Core Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose 0.3% MoM in December, while the annual core rate held at 2.3%.\nHeadline HICP increased 0.2% on the month, with yearly inflation easing slightly to 1.9%, just under the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) 2% target.\nThe data reinforce expectations that the ECB is likely to maintain a cautious, wait-and-see stance and keep interest rates on hold for an extended period.\nBeyond trade rhetoric, the Greenback is also losing some momentum as political and institutional uncertainties build. Markets are increasingly cautious ahead of an expected US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of President Trump\u2019s use of emergency tariff powers, while attention is also turning to a potential shift in Federal Reserve (Fed) leadership, with Trump expected to announce his decision later this week.\nLooking ahead, traders are positioning cautiously ahead of a heavy US economic calendar later this week. The focus will be on the delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation reports for October and November, alongside third-quarter GDP figures, preliminary S&P Global PMI surveys and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment data.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year.

The pair rose above 1.1640 after Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs related to Greenland, causing risk aversion in global markets.\nEconomic Discussions In Europe\nEconomic discussions in Europe include the EU\u2019s potential retaliatory measures, which could involve \u20ac93 billion in tariffs on American goods. Additionally, inflation data showed a dip below the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target, implying interest rates might remain stable for the year.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has decreased by 0.32% to 99.06 amidst these tensions. As the Federal Reserve enters its blackout period before its upcoming meeting, investors turn their attention to upcoming economic indicators, including the World Economic Forum in Davos and the ADP Employment Change in the US.\nThe Euro has seen varied movements against other major currencies. Against the US Dollar, the Euro shows a positive change of 0.91% this month. The ongoing trade disputes and economic data shifts have significantly influenced currency valuations, with technical analysis indicating possible directional shifts for the EUR/USD currency pair based on moving averages.\nWe are seeing a classic risk-off move as the US escalates its trade war, pushing EUR/USD above 1.1640. This sudden geopolitical tension is injecting major uncertainty, much like we saw during the 2018-2019 US-China disputes when the VIX volatility index surged over 40% on similar tariff news. Buying options to play this increased volatility, rather than just direction, is a prudent approach.\nCaution On The Dollar\u2019s Safe Haven\nWhile the Dollar has weakened initially, we must be cautious about writing off its safe-haven appeal entirely. Looking back at the 2018-2019 period, the US Dollar Index (DXY) often strengthened as investors bet on the relative resilience of the US economy despite the trade friction. A reversal is possible if the EU\u2019s retaliation appears weak or their own economic data falters.\nWe must separate the Euro\u2019s current strength from its underlying economic reality. With Eurozone inflation dipping to 1.9% in December 2025, the European Central Bank has no reason to consider raising interest rates this year. This policy divergence makes the EUR/USD rally fundamentally fragile and susceptible to a sharp pullback if trade fears subside.\nAs we navigate the Federal Reserve\u2019s blackout period ahead of its January 28 meeting, headlines from the Davos forum or EU retaliation plans will drive price action. We should use options to set positions around the key technical levels, particularly the resistance at the 50-day SMA near 1.1656 and support at the 200-day SMA of 1.1586. Any sign of de-escalation could see the pair quickly test those lower bounds."

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair showed strength, reaching around 1.3400 in the early Asian session on Monday. This movement was spurred by US Dollar weakness, linked to President Trump\u2019s latest tariff threats against Europe over Greenland.\nThe US markets were closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Trump proposed a 10% import tariff from February 1 on goods from several European countries, including the UK, to press for the acquisition of Greenland.\nThe Pound Starts Strong\nThe Pound Sterling began the week strong, rising to 1.3486 after news of criminal charges against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, sentiments turned negative as a Bank of England policymaker delivered dovish comments, leading to a shift in focus towards the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming monetary policy decision.\nElsewhere, meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe experienced a roughly 3% drop, continuing last week\u2019s decline. These coins traded below key moving averages, suggesting potential momentum changes. Gold hit a new peak of $4,690 due to Trump\u2019s tariff threats and geopolitical risks, sparking caution in the markets.\nOverall, the week\u2019s developments brought volatility, impacting both traditional and digital assets.\nLooking back to this time in 2025, we saw the Pound surge against the Dollar to the 1.3400 level on geopolitical shocks. The market reacted strongly to unexpected tariff threats from the US, reminding us how quickly political news can move currency pairs. That volatility was a key feature of trading this pair a year ago.\nEconomic Fundamentals Drive the Market Now\nToday, on January 19, 2026, the landscape is driven more by economic fundamentals than by sudden political announcements. The key focus now is the policy divergence between the Bank of England (BoE) and the US Federal Reserve. This makes trading less about reacting to headlines and more about anticipating central bank moves.\nWe are watching inflation data closely, as UK inflation remains stickier than in the US, with the last reading for 2025 coming in at 3.9%. In contrast, US inflation has cooled more consistently, giving the Federal Reserve more flexibility. This fundamental difference suggests underlying strength for the dollar against the pound.\nGiven this divergence, we believe selling GBP/USD on any significant rallies could be a prudent strategy in the coming weeks. Using options to buy puts on the pair could also offer a way to profit from a potential downturn while managing risk. The volatility seen last year shows that sudden spikes can provide good entry points for short positions.\nThe extreme move in gold to nearly $4,700 an ounce during the 2025 tariff scare was a textbook flight to safety. We should remember this lesson and consider using derivatives on gold as a hedge against any new, unforeseen global risks. Even as we focus on central banks, the potential for a political wildcard event remains."

The pair moves little as traders adopt caution ahead of labor market data from the United Kingdom (UK) due later in the day. Focus will shift toward the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales figures for December later in the week.\nThe ILO Unemployment Rate is forecast to ease to 5% from 5.1% in the three months to November, the highest since early 2021. Meanwhile, Average Earnings Including Bonuses are expected to slow to 4.6% from 4.7%.\nThe GBP/USD pair could further gain ground as the US Dollar (USD) comes under pressure from rising uncertainty over the US\u2013Greenland issue. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that 10% tariff would be levied on goods from EU members Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, as well as Britain and Norway, effective February 1, until the US is permitted to purchase Greenland. In response, European Union ambassadors agreed on Sunday to step up efforts to deter the tariffs, while also preparing retaliatory measures if the duties are implemented.\nThe Greenback could strengthen as US labor market data have delayed expectations for additional Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts until June. Fed officials have indicated limited urgency to ease policy further without clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. Reflecting this shift, Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook to one rate cut in June followed by another in September, instead of the previously expected cuts in January and April.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a countr"

It retreated to 1.3380, down from the year-to-date high of 1.3565, and is hovering near its lowest level since December 22nd.\nSterling Slips Ahead of UK Macro Data\nThe GBP/USD exchange rate retreated as investors reacted to the recent UK macro data and the latest development from the United States, where Donald Trump announced a new tariff on UK goods entering the country.\nA report by the ONS showed that the economy expanded at a faster pace than expected, helped by the ongoing recovery of Jaguar Land Rover after last year's hack. It expanded by 0.3% in November, higher than the median estimate of 0.1%. The services sector expanded by 0.3%, while production rose by 1.1%.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump said that UK goods entering the country will be charged an extra 10% tariff, which will increase to 25% until he succeeds in acquiring Greenland.\nLooking ahead, focus will be on the upcoming macro data from the UK, which will help the Bank of England (BoE) when making its future interest rate decisions. The UK will publish the latest jobs data on Tuesday, with economists expecting that the unemployment rate eased from 5.1% to 5%.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nThe ONS will then publish the latest inflation report on Wednesday. Economists expect the data to show that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose slightly from 3.3% in November to 3.3% in December, while the core CPI moved to 3.3%. The closely-watched Retail Price Index (RPI) is expected to come in at 4% from the previous 3.8%.\nIf these estimates are accurate, it means that the BoE will be hesitant to cut interest rates in the coming meetings as inflation has remained above the 2% target for years.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the GBP/USD exchange rate has pulled back in the past few weeks, moving from a high of 1.3565 to the current 1.3380.\nIt has moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nOn the positive side, the pair has formed a falling wedge pattern, which is made up of two descending and converging trendlines.\nThis wedge formed after the pair surged from a low of 1.3015 in November to a high of 1.3565. As such, this pullback is part of the formation of a bullish flag pattern.\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is where it rebounds in the coming days, potentially to the year-to-date high of 1.3565.\nReady to trade our free trading signals?

On the one hand, President Trump\u2019s threat to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries has sparked a general \u201crisk-off\u201d mood, hurting the US dollar and providing AUD/USD with some support. Investors have tilted toward classic safe havens like JPY and CHF, capping further gains in AUD. However, the Aussie remains stronger, being China\u2019s proxy currency.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about crypto signals? Check our detailed guide-\nSpeaking of China, Q4 GDP growth of 4.5% YoY, slightly above consensus, reinforces Australia\u2019s export outlook and underpins commodity-linked currencies. Industrial production at 5.2% YoY and a 1.0% MoM surge in Australia\u2019s TD-MI inflation gauge have added further upside bias to AUD. This suggests underlying demand pressure in the economy. Yet December retail sales came in below forecasts, underscoring lingering domestic headwinds.\nLooking ahead, the local labor market report on Thursday could be the next catalyst. Consensus calls for a 30K increase in employment and a small uptick in unemployment to 4.4%. A stronger-than-expected print could sharply lift rate-hike odds from 27% for February to 76% for May. This could drive AUD/USD toward the mid-0.6700s. Conversely, a disappointing jobs figure would reinforce RBA easing bets, risking a slide back toward 0.6660.\nAUD/USD Technical Forecast: Consolidation Near Support\nAUD/USD remains in a tight consolidation, staying above the 200-period MA at around 0.6670.

The AUD/USD pair appreciates as the Greenback struggles amid escalating uncertainty surrounding the United States (US)\u2013Greenland issue.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he would impose tariffs on eight European countries opposing his proposal to acquire Greenland. In response, European Union (EU) ambassadors agreed on Sunday to intensify efforts to deter US President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on European allies, while also preparing retaliatory measures should the duties move forward.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, announced to leave its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) unchanged on Tuesday.

On a monthly basis, inflation surged 1.0% month-over-month (MoM) in December 2025, the fastest pace since December 2023 and a sharp acceleration from 0.3% in the prior two months.\nThe AUD could find support as emerging upward price pressures strengthen expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

Fed officials have signaled little urgency to ease policy further until there is clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook, now forecasting one rate cut in June followed by another in September, compared with their previous expectation of cuts in January and April.\n- The US Department of Labor (DOL) reported on Thursday that Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly fell to 198K in the week ended January 10, below market expectations of 215K and down from the prior week\u2019s revised 207K. The data confirmed that layoffs remain limited and that the labor market is holding up despite an extended period of high borrowing costs.\n- US Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in December, below market expectations, while annual core inflation held at 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The data provided a clearer sign of easing inflation after earlier releases were skewed by shutdown effects. Meanwhile, CPI increased by 0.3% month-over-month in December 2025, matching market expectations and repeating the rise seen in September.

This tempered expectations for a more accommodative Fed.\nHowever, AUD/USD has shown resilience at the start of this week, bouncing back above 0.6690 despite risk-off flows pressuring global equity markets, triggered by President Trump threatening 10% tariffs on several European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies unless the United States (US) is granted permission to purchase Greenland.\nImpact of precious metals and China\u2019s economic data\nThis threat has sparked US dollar selling as investors weigh potential disruptions to NATO alliances and trade agreements established last year. It has indirectly benefitted AUD/USD as precious metals hit fresh record highs upon their reopening this morning.\nChina's latest economic data has also provided support for AUD/USD as fourth quarter (Q4) 2025 GDP grew 4.5% year-on-year (YoY), slowing from the third quarter's (Q3) 4.8% pace but above the 4.4% expected. For the full year, growth was 5.0%, meeting Beijing's official target and underscoring resilience in the world's second-largest economy and Australia\u2019s largest trading partner.\nLabour force report\nDate: Thursday, 22 January at 11.30am AEDT\nFor November, employment in Australia fell by 21,000 jobs, falling short of the 20,000 gain the market expected. Despite this, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, below the 4.4% expected, largely due to a dip in the participation rate to 66.7% from October's 66.9%.\nWhile monthly labour force data can be volatile and subject to noise, the November labour force report aligns with other indicators, such as easing job vacancies and slower wage growth, suggesting gradually increasing spare capacity in the labour market.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) faces a delicate balancing act in 2026, in pursuing its dual mandate of low and stable inflation alongside full employment. With headline inflation pushing above the 2% \u20133% target band, policymakers will seek to cool price pressures without inducing significant job losses.\nDecember preview: The December 2025 Labour Force Survey is expected to show a rebound in employment, with consensus forecasts pointing to a gain of around 30,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to edge higher to 4.4%, aligning with the RBA's quarterly forecast for the remainder of this year and next year.\nThis week\u2019s jobs data, alongside the Q4 inflation report due next week, will be pivotal in shaping the outcome of the RBA\u2019s 3 February board meeting. Ahead of this meeting, the Australian interest rate market is pricing in 6 basis points (bp) of RBA rate hikes for February. Pricing for a first full 25 bp hike has been pushed back to August and there is a cumulative 33 bp of RBA rate hikes priced between now and the end of 2026.\nAU unemployment rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nThe retreat from last Tuesday\u2019s 0.6727 high has left a potential head and shoulders topping pattern in AUD/USD. While we aren\u2019t huge fans of head and shoulders topping patterns, this one is more notable for the reason it is tracing out up against multi-month trend channel resistance in the 0.6750 - 0.6770 area.\nIf AUD/USD were to see a sustained break of the neckline of the head and shoulders at approximately 0.6665 - 0.6660, it would warn that AUD/USD has formed a medium-term top at last week\u2019s 0.6"

                "body": "Citi flags risk of three BOJ hikes if yen stays weak.\nCiti puts USD/JPY at the centre of the BOJ reaction function, with 160+ the level that could drag rate hikes forward.\nSummary:\nCiti\u2019s Hoshino sees risk of three BOJ hikes if yen stays weak\nUSD/JPY > 160 could bring an April move to 1%\nAnother hike in July, with a possible third by year-end\nRationale: negative real rates are pressuring the yen\nFaster BOJ path contrasts with more gradual consensus timing\nCitigroup\u2019s head of markets for Japan, Akira Hoshino, says the Bank of Japan could end up hiking rates three times in 2026 \u2014 effectively doubling the current policy level \u2014 if yen weakness persists, highlighting how the exchange rate is becoming a more central input into Japan\u2019s policy debate.\nIn a Bloomberg (gated) interview, Hoshino argued the yen\u2019s slide is fundamentally rooted in negative real interest rates, where yields remain below inflation, and that the BOJ may have little choice but to respond if it wants to change the currency\u2019s direction. He outlined a scenario in which USD/JPY moving above \u00a5160 would raise the odds of an April hike, taking the overnight call rate up by 25bp to 1%, followed by another 25bp increase in July, and potentially a third move by year-end should the yen remain low.\nThat path is more hawkish than the consensus view, which generally expects the next BOJ move to be months away and often centers on mid-year timing rather than an April trigger. Reuters reporting has also flagged that some policymakers see scope to move sooner if the weak yen threatens to broaden inflation pressures, putting April \u201cin play\u201d even if the BOJ is widely expected to hold steady at its next meeting.\nHoshino also pointed to a potential flow channel: if Japanese yields (notably in the 10-year sector) rise to a point where they exceed inflation, domestic institutions may consider reallocating money from overseas back into Japanese fixed income. In his view, a lack of attractive onshore yield options has been one reason the weak yen has proven persistent.\nBottom line: Citi\u2019s scenario frames USD/JPY levels \u2014 especially 160+ \u2014 as a practical catalyst for faster BOJ normalisation, even if the baseline remains gradual."

Demand for defensive assets has increased as geopolitical and trade risks resurface.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs against eight European countries in response to tensions over Greenland. These remarks have sparked backlash from European leaders and heightened market uncertainty.\nDomestic attention is also focused on the upcoming Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting, where the market expects the central bank to maintain its current policy stance. Investors are looking to June as a potential timeline for the first rate hike. Adding to the uncertainty, rumors about early elections in Japan are circulating. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may announce elections next month to consolidate his position and promote a more flexible budget policy. As part of his campaign, Takaichi is also considering temporarily suspending the 8% food sales tax to ease the burden of rising food prices.\nTechnical Analysis:\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, USD/JPY is consolidating around the 158.10 level, with the market recently breaking down from this range. A potential decline to 156.81 is in focus, with a rebound to 158.10 possible after reaching that level. The MACD indicator supports this bearish outlook, as its signal line remains below the zero mark and points downward.\nH1 Chart:\nOn the H1 chart, a downward wave towards 157.36 is forming, with a possible correction to 158.10 before another decline to 156.81. This scenario is confirmed by the Stochastic oscillator, which shows the signal line descending towards the 20 level.\nConclusion:\nUSD/JPY remains in a consolidation phase, with the market reacting to both domestic and international uncertainties. Investors are closely watching the BOJ meeting and the potential for political developments in Japan. Technically, the pair is showing signs of short-term bearishness, with further declines possible in the near term.\nBy RoboForex Analytical Department\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

                "body": "USD/CAD steadies above 1.3850 as Canadian Dollar weakens on lower Oil prices\n- USD/CAD steadies as weaker Oil prices, driven by US\u2013EU tensions, weigh on global demand.\n- President Trump said a 10% tariff on goods from eight European countries would take effect February 1 over Greenland.\n- The Greenback may strengthen as US labor data push expectations for further Fed rate cuts to June.\nUSD/CAD edges higher after registering modest losses in the previous session, trading around 1.3870 during the Asian hours on Tuesday. The pair appreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid lower Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price inches lower after two days of gains, trading around $59.30 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude oil prices edge lower as rising frictions between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) cloud the outlook for global Oil demand.\nHowever, the upside potential in USD/CAD may be limited as the US Dollar comes under pressure from rising uncertainty over the US\u2013Greenland issue. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that 10% tariff would be levied on goods from EU members Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, as well as Britain and Norway, effective February 1, until the US is permitted to purchase Greenland. In response, European Union ambassadors agreed on Sunday to step up efforts to deter the tariffs, while also preparing retaliatory measures if the duties are implemented.\nThe Greenback could strengthen as US labor market data have delayed expectations for additional Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts until June. Fed officials have indicated limited urgency to ease policy further without clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. Reflecting this shift, Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook to one rate cut in June followed by another in September, instead of the previously expected cuts in January and April.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from gl"

                "body": "The USD/CAD has dipped below 1.3900 due to a broader decline in the US Dollar. This follows a tariff threat on EU countries by President Trump, affecting market dynamics.\nOil prices, key for the Canadian Dollar, have also fallen, with WTI Oil trading over 5% below the last week\u2019s peak. Canadian consumer inflation data is expected to potentially steer the Canadian Dollar\u2019s direction.\nBank Of Canada Influences\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decisions, Oil prices, and various economic indicators such as inflation and GDP are primary influencers of the Canadian Dollar. Higher interest rates tend to support the currency by attracting capital while Oil price fluctuations directly impact its value.\nInflation data affects the CAD as higher inflation could lead central banks to raise interest rates. Economic data like employment rates and GDP influence the CAD, with strong figures potentially driving it higher.\nThe US market closure for Martin Luther King Jr. Day could affect market attention on the Canadian Consumer Prices Index, with expectations of December\u2019s rates impacting the Canadian Dollar. The BoC\u2019s actions, Oil prices, and US economic health remain pivotal for CAD direction.\nLooking back to this time in 2025, we saw how quickly geopolitical announcements could drive the US Dollar lower and push USD/CAD below 1.3900. That dip was a direct result of unexpected tariff threats, a reminder that headline risk can override other factors. The market is now pricing in a different kind of political uncertainty, focusing on the new US administration\u2019s ongoing trade policy reviews with major partners.\nGeneralized US Dollar Weakness\nThe generalized US Dollar weakness we saw in early 2025 is not the dominant theme today. The Dollar Index (DXY) is holding steady above 104.50 as markets await clearer signals from both the Federal Reserve and Washington\u2019s stance on international trade agreements. This creates a more tense, range-bound environment for the greenback compared to the sharp, reactive selling we experienced last year.\nOn the Canadian side, the inflation picture has firmed up considerably since the -.3% contractionary fears of December 2024 mentioned in the 2025 analysis. Recent data for December 2025 showed Canada\u2019s annual CPI holding at 2.8%, which is keeping the Bank of Canada from signaling any immediate interest rate cuts. This monetary policy divergence offers underlying support for the Canadian dollar.\nOil prices are also providing a much stronger tailwind for the loonie than they did in January 2025, when WTI crude fell to near $58 a barrel. Today, WTI is holding above $74 a barrel, supported by disciplined OPEC+ production and steady global demand forecasts for the first half of 2026. This elevated price for Canada\u2019s primary export adds a bullish fundamental pressure on the Canadian dollar that was absent last year.\nGiven this backdrop, traders should consider positioning for potential downside in USD/CAD, but with caution inspired by the volatility of 2025. Buying put options on USD/CAD could be an effective way to speculate on a move lower, driven by strong oil and a hawkish Bank of Canada. This strategy offers a defined risk, protecting traders from a sudden surge in the US Dollar should geopolitical tensions flare up unexpectedly.\nFor those wanting to protect against volatility in either direction, using straddles or strangles could be a viable strategy for the coming weeks. This approach allows traders to profit from a significant price move, regardless of the direction, which is ideal in a market weighing strong Canadian fundamentals against unpredictable global political risk. It\u2019s a direct lesson from the sudden market jolts we saw in 2025."

                "body": "The week begins with a clear bearish bias in USD/CAD, posting a decline of around -0.31% in the short term. Selling pressure has remained consistent, driven by the recovery in the Canadian dollar following the release of inflation data in Canada, along with a growing sense of distrust toward the U.S. dollar. As long as these factors remain in place, selling pressure is likely to stay relevant in USD/CAD price action over the coming sessions.\nEarly inflation data begins to emerge\nEarlier today, monthly and annual CPI data for Canada were released. Official figures showed a CPI m/m of -0.2%, compared to an expected -0.3%, while annual CPI came in at 2.4%, above the expected 2.2%, corresponding to December 2025. What stands out from these figures is that inflation does not yet show clear signs of a meaningful slowdown. On a year-over-year basis, the 2.4% reading remains above the 2.2% levels seen in October and November 2025, suggesting that inflationary pressure in Canada continues to be a relevant factor that could influence monetary policy decisions in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIn this context, it is worth recalling that the Bank of Canada has repeatedly stated that its monetary policy stance and the decision to maintain neutral interest rates largely depend on inflation dynamics. Based on the latest data, markets may anticipate that, at the January 28 meeting, the central bank will maintain a neutral policy stance, aiming to prevent inflation from accelerating further in the coming months.\nThis expectation is already beginning to be reflected in the fixed-income market. Canadian 10-year bond yields have rebounded toward the 3.4% area, once again showing a consistent upward slope. This behavior suggests that fixed-income markets are reacting to the prospect of a more neutral monetary policy outlook ahead of the next central bank decision.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nAs the fixed-income market shows signs of recovery, this could encourage foreign capital inflows seeking exposure to Canadian assets, which in turn may support stronger demand for the Canadian dollar. If this scenario persists, current selling pressure on USD/CAD could intensify in the sessions ahead.\nThe U.S. dollar shows renewed weakness\nAnother relevant factor is the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar, linked to a short-term loss of confidence in the currency following announcements related to a possible reactivation of tariffs by the United States toward certain European countries. In this environment, the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against its major peers, has developed a consistent downward slope, with price action approaching the 99-point level, highlighting a structural weakness in the currency.\nSource: Marketwatch\nGiven this backdrop, persistent U.S. dollar weakness may be facilitating a short-term recovery in the Canadian dollar. If the dollar continues to underperform in the coming sessions, the CAD could strengthen further, reinforcing sustained selling pressure in USD/CAD.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Lack of clear direction begins to show in price action: Over recent months, USD/CAD had developed a gradual bullish move that was beginning to consolidate a potential ascending channel. However, in recent sessions, price action has entered a neutral phase, suggesting that bullish momentum has lost clarity. This behavior indicates that the pair could trade within a short-term range, as the market waits for a new catalyst to define the next directional move.\n- RSI: The RSI remains oscillating near the neutral 50 level, indicating a balance between buying and selling forces. This setup points to a potential prolonged neutral scenario, which could translate into a period of indecision in the coming sessions.\n- MACD: A similar scenario is visible in the MACD, with the histogram approaching the zero line, once again reflecting a balance in short-term moving averages.

Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama signaled the possibility of coordinated intervention with the United States to support the weak currency. On Friday, Katayama reiterated that all options remain on the table, including direct market intervention.\nJapan\u2019s Industrial Production fell 2.7% month-over-month (MoM) in November 2025, slightly worse than the 2.6% preliminary estimate, reversing October\u2019s 1.5% gain and marking the sharpest decline since January 2024.\nThe JPY also receives support from expectations of Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hikes. The Japanese central bank is widely expected to hold its policy rate at 0.75% this week, though markets are monitoring the possibility of a move in June. Last week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that the central bank remains prepared to raise rates if economic and price developments evolve in line with its outlook.\nCentral banks FAQs\nCentral Banks have a key mandate which is making sure that there is price stability in a country or region. Economies are constantly facing inflation or deflation when prices for certain goods and services are fluctuating. Constant rising prices for the same goods means inflation, constant lowered prices for the same goods means deflation. It is the task of the central bank to keep the demand in line by tweaking its policy rate. For the biggest central banks like the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of England (BoE), the mandate is to keep inflation close to 2%.\nA central bank has one important tool at its disposal to get inflation higher or lower, and that is by tweaking its benchmark policy rate, commonly known as interest rate. On pre-communicated moments, the central bank will issue a statement with its policy rate and provide additional reasoning on why it is either remaining or changing (cutting or hiking) it. Local banks will adjust their savings and lending rates accordingly, which in turn will make it either harder or easier for people to earn on their savings or for companies to take out loans and make investments in their businesses. When the central bank hikes interest rates substantially, this is called monetary tightening. When it is cutting its benchmark rate, it is called monetary easing.\nA central bank is often politically independent. Members of the central bank policy board are passing through a series of panels and hearings before being appointed to a policy board seat. Each member in that board often has a certain conviction on how the central bank should control inflation and the subsequent monetary policy. Members that want a very loose monetary policy, with low rates and cheap lending, to boost the economy substantially while being content to see inflation slightly above 2%, are called \u2018doves\u2019. Members that rather want to see higher rates to reward savings a"

Investors are now turning their attention to upcoming key UK releases this week, such as employment and consumer price index data, which could offer further clues about the Bank of England\u2019s future policy direction.\nHowever, gains in the GBP/JPY pair may be limited as the Japanese Yen finds support amid speculation of intervention by Japanese officials. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama has hinted at the possibility of joint action with the United States to bolster the Yen. On Friday, Katayama emphasized that all measures, including direct intervention in the currency markets, remain under consideration.\nJapan\u2019s industrial output dropped by 2.7% month-on-month in November 2025, a steeper fall than the preliminary estimate of 2.6%, reversing a 1.5% rise in October and marking the largest decline since January 2024.\nThe Yen is also underpinned by expectations that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates. While the central bank is anticipated to keep its policy rate steady at 0.75% this week, market participants are watching for any signals of a potential rate hike in June. Last week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reaffirmed the bank\u2019s readiness to increase rates if economic and inflation trends align with their projections."

                "body": "If you're a Bitcoin (BTC 0.93%) investor, it's not too early to start thinking about 2028.\nThe reasons for this are twofold. First, 2028 marks the date of the next Bitcoin halving. Second, 2028 marks the final year of the Trump administration, which has pledged on numerous occasions to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"\nBoth events could have seismic implications for the future price of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin halving\nOne event central to the lore of Bitcoin investing is the halving. This event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin by half, acts to increase its perceived scarcity.\nBitcoin halving events take place roughly every four years. Thus far, Bitcoin halvings have taken place in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024. The next Bitcoin halving is projected for April 2028.\nCRYPTO: BTC\nKey Data Points\nThe halving is important because it has historically led to monster rallies in Bitcoin's price. You can think of it as the official kick-off of a period of rapid price appreciation that can last from 12 to 18 months. Even better, the halving typically leads to a new all-time high for Bitcoin.\nFor example, consider the last Bitcoin halving. It took place on April 19, 2024, when Bitcoin was trading for about $64,000. By the end of the year, Bitcoin had broken through the $100,000 price level. In 2025, Bitcoin soared even higher, eventually hitting a new all-time high of $126,000 in October.\nSo, if all goes according to plan, Bitcoin could be heading for another halving-induced rally in 2028. Bitcoin nearly doubled in price after the most recent halving, so is another doubling in price on the way in 2028?\nThe only question, of course, is what happens between now and then. Historically, Bitcoin follows a four-year cycle of boom and bust. The 12- to 18-month period of price appreciation ignited by the halving usually ends in a final blow-off top and then a spectacular collapse in Bitcoin's price.\nGiven that the current period of price appreciation started nearly 21 months ago, that means Bitcoin could be headed for a downturn this year. So I'm certainly not expecting the path of Bitcoin to be straight up in 2026 and 2027.\nBitcoin and politics\nIs it too early to be talking about 2028 presidential politics? Perhaps so. But a number of influential crypto insiders have already highlighted the political pressure building within the Trump administration to make sure all the crypto successes of the past year are not immediately rolled back by the next administration.\nFor example, consider the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Launched to much fanfare last March, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has languished ever since. Right now, it consists only of Bitcoin that has been seized or confiscated by the U.S. government, and does not include any new Bitcoin purchases.\nBut that could change as early as this year. According to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, the Trump administration may be tempted to initiate Bitcoin purchases for the reserve ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe thinking here is simple: Higher Bitcoin prices will likely help pro-Trump (and pro-crypto) political candidates in the midterm elections. A higher Bitcoin price will also help to bring in new crypto industry donations for projects like the new White House ballroom.\nWhat will be the price of Bitcoin in 2028?\nIn the period from 2017 to 2025, Bitcoin posted a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44%. That time period coincided with two halving-fueled rallies (2020 and 2024) and two spectacular collapses (in 2018 and 2022).\nSo let's assume that Bitcoin continues to grow at a CAGR of 44% throughout 2026 and 2027. Assuming a baseline price of $100,000 in January 2026, Bitcoin could theoretically hit a price of $200,000 heading into 2028.\nThat's when things could get really interesting. The 2028 Bitcoin halving, combined with strong political tailwinds coming out of the Trump administration, could send the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing. A lot has to go right, of course, but there's a go"

Ether-linked funds recorded $479 million in net inflows last week, their strongest weekly inflow total since the week ended October 10, mirroring the recovery in bitcoin-related products.\nBitcoin pulls back on geopolitical headlines\nThe positive momentum, however, proved short-lived. Bitcoin retreated over the weekend and into Monday after headlines emerged around rising tensions between the United States and the European Union related to Greenland.\nBitcoin fell about 2.6% over the past 24 hours to around $92,618, down from roughly $95,400 earlier in the day.\nThe broader cryptocurrency market also came under pressure, with major altcoins such as Ether, Solana, and Cardano sliding in tandem with Bitcoin.\nThe selloff coincided with a broader risk-off move in traditional markets following mutual tariff threats between Washington and Brussels.\nWhile crypto markets traded through the weekend and initially appeared to ignore the news, selling accelerated once Asian markets opened.\nTariff threats spark risk-off mood\nUS President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on eight European nations that have opposed his proposal for the United States to acquire Greenland.\nTrump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom and Norway, starting Feb. 1, and said the measures would remain in place until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.\nAccording to a Financial Times report on Sunday, EU capitals are weighing retaliation, including up to \u20ac93 billion ($101 billion) in tariffs on U.S. goods or restrictions on American companies\u2019 access to the EU market.\nThe escalating rhetoric triggered a wave of risk aversion among traders, weighing on assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies.\nHeavy liquidations amplify the move\nThe downturn was exacerbated by forced liquidations across the crypto derivatives market.\nIn the past 24 hours, roughly $824 million in positions were liquidated, according to Coinglass data aggregated from publicly available sources.\nOf that total, about $763.7 million were long positions, highlighting how heavily positioned the market had become on the bullish side.\nThe single largest liquidation was reported on Hyperliquid, where a BTCUSDT position worth $25.83 million was wiped out.\nBitcoin fell as much as 3.8% shortly after the Asian trading session opened, before trimming losses to around 2.5% during European hours.\nAnalysts noted that the move occurred during a period of relatively low liquidity, allowing sellers to exert outsized influence and "

Proponents of DAOs say they offer a more decentralised and less hierarchical alternative to traditional corporate governance.\nButerin\u2019s pledge comes after trust in the DAO structure has deteriorated in recent years. Major scandals have erupted and put into question the viability of decentralised governance.\nCritics argue that the DAOs governing DeFi lender Aave and decentralised exchange Uniswap have little control over major decisions at their respective protocols.\nOther DAOs have been accused of mismanaging funds, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars evaporating with little to show for it.\nElsewhere, inactivity and voter apathy has left many DAOs vulnerable to hostile takeovers.\nOverall, DAOs are becoming quieter and less decentralised, according to a joint report by DefiLlama and DL Research. DefiLlama and DL Research are DL News\u2019 sister companies.\nButerin is no stranger to the issues DAOs face. The current interaction of DAOs are inefficient, vulnerable to capture, and fail to mitigate the weaknesses of human politics, he said.\nHere are Buterin\u2019s five arguments for more and better DAOs.\nFixing oracle design\nMany crypto products rely on oracles \u2014 tools that tell the blockchain things like asset prices or other offchain information.\nButerin says the current oracle designs are fundamentally flawed and easy to manipulate. If voting is based on tokens, big holders can push answers their way. If humans control the data, it stops being truly decentralised.\n\u201cToday, decentralised stablecoins, prediction markets, and other basic building blocks of DeFi are built on oracle designs that we are not satisfied with,\u201d Buterin said.\nSettling disputes onchain\nSome apps, like DeFi insurers or prediction markets, need to make judgement calls when things go wrong.\nRight now, Ethereum doesn\u2019t handle those disputes well. They often end up offchain, handled by companies or courts.\nButerin says DAOs are the best way to handle these decisions together, onchain, without giving control to one central authority.\nOnchain dispute resolution is a \u201cnecessary component of many types of more advanced smart contract use cases,\u201d he said.\nKeeping lists honest\nEthereum depends on lots of lists of which apps are safe, which smart contracts are real, and which interfaces are standard.\nToday, many of these lists are run by small teams or single organisations, creating hidden and opaque power.\nDAOs can maintain these lists openly, letting communities decide together instead of trusting one gatekeeper, Buterin argues.\nHelping startup projects\nDAOs let people come together, raise funds, and build something fast, especially for small or short-term projects.\n\u201cIf you have a group of people, who all want something done and are willing to contribute some funds (perhaps in exchange for benefits), then how do you manage this, especially if the task is too short-duration for legal entities to be worth it?\u201d Buterin said.\nKeeping projects alive\nWhen crypto founders disappear, many projects slowly die.\nDAOs solve that by letting communities take over. New people can join, funding can continue, and important tools don\u2019t vanish just because the original team moved on, Buterin said.\n\u201cWe need DAOs to do long-term project maintenance.\u201d\nLance Datskoluo is DL News\u2019 E"

At the same time, ETH price slipped back to $3,200 after another rejection near $3,400.\nRecord transactions as gas falls\nEthereum activity pushed toward record levels as transaction costs sank to fractions of a cent, according to data cited in recent market reports and on-chain dashboards. Coin Bureau said Ethereum\u2019s daily transactions climbed toward about 2.5 million while average gas fees fell below $0.01, pointing to a rare mix of heavy throughput and ultra-low execution costs.\nOn Ethereum fee trackers, base fees showed near-zero readings in gwei terms, which wallets use to estimate confirmation times and costs. One widely shared gas screen showed a base fee near 0.054 gwei with \u201clow,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d options clustered around the same level, implying little competition for block space at that moment.\nMeanwhile, third-party coverage tied the usage spike to a multi-week climb in transaction counts, often cited on a moving-average basis to smooth daily swings. Decrypt reported that Ethereum\u2019s 7-day moving average for daily transactions set a new high earlier this month, based on CryptoQuant data, as network interactions accelerated into early 2026.\nSeparate market updates also pointed to new single-day milestones. A Binance News post, citing Etherscan-referenced figures via ChainCatcher, said Ethereum reached about 2.88 million transactions in a day, another sign that on-chain throughput has expanded even as the typical fee environment remains subdued.\nETH retreats after $3,400 rejection\nMeanwhile, Ethereum pulled back to the $3,200 area after failing to clear resistance near $3,400, according to a TradingView chart shared by analyst Ted Pillows on X.

                "body": "ETHUSD Today: January 19 DeFi Casinos Draw Regulator Scrutiny\nCrypto casino regulation is in focus today as DeFi gambling grows and draws policy attention. For German investors, scrutiny of smart contract casinos could affect Ethereum activity and fees. In the latest dataset, ETHUSD printed $3,224.35, down 2.81% on the day, with momentum near neutral. Regulators are weighing KYC and AML rules for these platforms, while stablecoin compliance sits center stage. US interest in offshore crypto casinos adds pressure. We break down market impact, EU and BaFin context, and practical steps for portfolios in Germany.\nRegulatory heat and Ethereum\u2019s on-chain activity\nDeFi gambling platforms can drive transactions, which support Ethereum fees and validator revenue. When activity rises, gas use and token demand can lift. If platforms slow due to tighter checks, fees and on-chain volumes may cool. That backdrop can dampen short-term sentiment even as core use cases like payments, NFTs, and DeFi lending continue to support the network.\nIn the EU, AML rules and MiCA set a stricter baseline. In Germany, BaFin and the Gl\u00fccksspielstaatsvertrag guide licensing for remote gambling and financial compliance. Tighter crypto casino regulation would likely push KYC, source-of-funds checks, and reporting. Early signals are visible as regulators examine smart contract casinos. German users should expect identity checks to become standard on compliant platforms.\nETH price and technical snapshot\nThe latest snapshot shows price $3,224.35, day low $3,177.66 and high $3,367.64. RSI sits at 49.07, near neutral. ADX is 24.43, suggesting a moderate trend. MACD histogram is 29.38, hinting at improving momentum. Bollinger Bands center at 3,008.50 with upper 3,245.91 and lower 2,771.08. ATR is 149.39, indicating elevated but manageable volatility.\nStricter checks could trim casino-driven transactions, softening gas demand. That may weigh on price near term, while credible compliance could attract regulated capital later. Model projections show $2,582.26 monthly, $3,472.03 quarterly, and $3,721.34 yearly baselines. Under firmer crypto casino regulation, dips toward the middle band may appear before buyers test the quarterly target.\nStablecoin compliance and casino flows\nStablecoins are the settlement rail for many smart contract casinos. EU MiCA brings issuance and reserve rules, while AML checks and Travel Rule obligations push platforms to verify users. Stronger stablecoin compliance would raise costs but reduce legal risk. That could shift volumes to regulated venues, while unverified flows face more friction and potential geofencing.\nInterest from US users in offshore crypto casinos has grown, spotlighting KYC gaps and cross-border enforcement. Policymakers are watching token rails and wallets that route these bets, with Web3 gaming tokens in the slipstream. A 2026 industry readout highlights regulation and stablecoins as defining forces for growth and risk this year.\nPortfolio angles for German investors\nWe favor small position sizes, staged buying, and strict stop levels. Use regulated exchanges with strong KYC, and keep long-term holdings in self-custody. Track smart contract approvals and contract risk. Remember tax reporting and record-keeping. If exposure comes via Web3 gaming tokens, size even smaller given liquidity swings and headline sensitivity.\nWatch BaFin statements, EU MiCA stablecoin guidance, and on-chain shares of gambling contracts in total gas. Track Bollinger middle near 3,008.50 and the quarterly projection at 3,472.03. If crypto casino regulation escalates, expect lower weekend liquidity and sharper wicks. Rising OBV and MFI would signal healthier demand returning despite policy noise.\nFinal Thoughts\nRegulators are circling DeFi gambling, and the near-term path for Ethereum may hinge on how fast platforms adapt. If KYC and stablecoin checks roll in smoothly, compliant operators could keep on-chain activity steady. If not, we may see softer "

Read More\nThe Solana blockchain just crossed the $1 billion milestone in real-world assets (RWA), a major signal that strengthens the long-term bullish Solana price prediction.\nAccording to data from RWA.xyz, the total value of tokenized RWAs on Solana surged by 17% over the past 30 days, highlighting growing adoption from institutions and DeFi protocols alike.\nThis has positioned Solana in the third spot. In this particular market, the blockchain still has a lot of work to do to overthrow Ethereum as the latter boasts a total of $12.8 billion in RWAs \u2013 over 12x more than the former.\nNonetheless, Solana is growing at a much faster rate, which could shorten the number of years that it would take the network to surpass its top competitor.\nBlackRock\u2019s USD Liquidity Fund is the largest program within Solana\u2019s RWA ecosystem with more than $200 million in assets.\nAs Solana continues to showcase its technical robustness and practical use cases, more institutional players like BlackRock could launch new initiatives to expand their footprint in the RWA space.\nSolana Price Prediction: SOL Hits Key Support at $130\nSolana (SOL) seems to be ready to retest the $130 support today. However, its price action continues to favor a bullish outlook as an ascending price channel has formed.\nIn the past 24 hours, the token has shed 6% as selling pressure increased significantly during the Asian session following a quiet weekend.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also sent a sell signal as it broke below the 14-day moving average.\nHowever, as long as the $130 level holds, we should get a strong bounce to $150 shortly. Meanwhile, if we break this barrier, SOL could retest $110 in the near term.\nAlthough the market has taken a breather lately, investors\u2019 interest in top crypto presales in the Solana ecosystem, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), keeps growing.\nBitcoin Hyper Is Bringing Solana\u2019s Speed to Bitcoin, Unlocking a New Way to Use BTC\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a hot new crypto presale bringing Solana-style speed to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nIt is the first-ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with smart contract support, allowing BTC to be used for more than just holding.\nThis means Bitcoin holders can access things like staking, trading, and on-chain applications, without having to move funds away from the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWith over $30 million already raised during its public presale, Bitcoin Hyper is quickly gaining attention as a project aiming to unlock new utility for Bitcoin users.\nA new phase for how Bitcoin can be used is starting, with Bitcoin Hyper focused on bringing programmability to Bitcoin while keeping BTC within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nThe $HYPER token powers this Bitcoin Layer 2, supporting transactions, presale staking rewards, governance participation, and access to applications built directly on Bitcoin Hyper.\nTo take part in the $HYPER presale, visit the official website and connect any compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet)\nFrom there, secure early access to $HYPER using USDT, ETH, BNB, or a bank card.\nVisit the Official Bitcoin Hyper Website Here- [LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders\n- New ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, PEPE and Ethereum By the End of 2026\n- China\u2019s Alibaba AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Bitcoin By the End of 2026\n- Bitcoin Braces as Trump Slaps 25% Tariffs on Europe Over Greenland\n- XRP Price Prediction: F"

                "body": "SOL Price Enters A Key Demand Zone\u2014Can Solana Rebound On Strong On-Chain Fundamentals?\nThe tariff-war chatter is back on the table, and it\u2019s shaking both Wall Street and crypto in tandem. Solana hasn\u2019t been spared. After pushing toward the $150 region, Solana SOLUSDT price faced a sharp rejection at a key resistance zone and then printed a weak weekend close below $140\u2014an early sign that momentum has tilted bearish to start the week.\nStill, the downside picture isn\u2019t clean-cut. While price action hints at a developing bearish curve, Solana\u2019s on-chain and ecosystem signals remain constructive, suggesting the current move could be more of a shakeout than a sustained breakdown\u2014especially if buyers defend the next support band and reclaim the rejected level quickly.\nMixed Fundamentals: Short-Term ETF Outflows, Long-Term Ecosystem Growth\nOn one side, Solana ETFs reportedly saw their first net outflows since launch, with withdrawals of roughly $2.2 million. That matters because ETF flows can influence short-term sentiment\u2014especially in a tape that\u2019s already risk-off. Even modest outflows can get amplified by traders as \u201cinstitutions are backing off,\u201d regardless of whether the flow is meaningful in the bigger picture.\nOn the other side, Solana\u2019s broader ecosystem narrative remains strong. The network continues to attract capital into on-chain use cases, with Solana\u2019s RWA ecosystem reportedly reaching ~$1.12B in TVL, reflecting growing institutional participation and expanding liquidity. If that trend holds, it supports the idea that Solana\u2019s demand is being driven by more than just memecoin cycles.\nAt the same time, expectations for TVL expansion into 2026\u2014some forecasts even pointing as high as $30B\u2014underline the market\u2019s longer-term belief that Solana\u2019s application layer will keep widening across multiple sectors.\nCan SOL Reclaim Resistance And Flip The Trend?\nWith Solana price compressing under resistance, the next move is likely to be decisive. The technical picture suggests SOL is still capped beneath the upper boundary of its structure, but the fundamentals argue the accumulation phase may not last long if buyers step in with conviction.\nThat sets up the key question for traders: Will SOL reclaim the rejected resistance zone and invalidate the bearish weekly open\u2014or will rallies continue to get sold until the market finds a deeper base?\nThe SOL price dropped below the average bands of Bollinger and appears to be heading towards the lower bands. However, the price range of around $128 is acting as a strong base, which has triggered a strong rebound on various occasions. On the other hand, the RSI is bearish, with the levels seeming to be poised to reach the lower threshold. In such a case, even if the price breaks below $128, the lower support of the Bollinger hold the rally. However, the range between $118.32 and $122.94 may act as the last point of defence.\nThe Bottom Line\nSolana\u2019s rejection at a key resistance has tilted the near-term bias bearish, and the chart now suggests buyers are losing control of momentum after a strong run-up. Still, the broader setup doesn\u2019t look broken. Ecosystem fundamentals remain supportive, with expanding RWA activity, steady application-driven adoption, and liquidity staying active across DeFi. If market-wide risk sentiment stabilizes, SOL could resume its recovery from this consolidation phase. For now, bulls need a clean reclaim of resistance to negate the bearish weekend signal."

                "body": "Introduction\nWhen you trade in the crypto market on centralized exchanges, you can see order books, ask and bid prices and trade data on your screens. On decentralized exchanges, this is not the case. There are no order books or ask and bid prices. Yet, you can see buying and selling on chain. Whales sometimes want to accumulate or offload assets without coming into anyone\u2019s notice. Exchanges are not the options for them as everyone can see the transaction, and the knowledge will affect the market prices. For complete anonymity, they resort to dark pools. They are more common in the traditional financial markets, but crypto whales also use the option.\nWhat are Dark Pools?\nDark pools in the crypto market are private trading arena for big players where they can trade in very large volumes without being visible to other traders. The reason behind keeping such trades is simple. Whales do not want to shake the market with their intentions and desire to execute their trades at a price relatively stable. If they bring money to an exchange, intentions become public and prices start moving before the whales can execute their trades. Dark pools hide the identity of the traders as well as the amount of assets being traded. The trading data does come out after the execution of the trades but till that time whales have already achieved their purpose.\nYou can understand the concept of dark pools by imagining private rooms away from the crowd where trading tycoons agree to carry out substantially big trades. Dark pools first emerged in the 1980s and have mostly been used by institutional investors who trade large numbers of securities. The appearance of Republic Protocol\u2019s RenEx in September 2018 is widely viewed as the first recognized case of crypto dark pools.\nThe Challenges of Creating Dark Pools in Crypto\nDespite the emergence of blockchain technology and the first cryptocurrency in 2008, the crypto market could not follow the footsteps of traditional stocks in terms of having dark pools till 2018. The delay was a natural result because the very nature of DeFi hampers the development of dark pools. All public blockchains are so transparent that a transaction is broadcast to the public before even being added to a block.\nMoreover, MEV (maximum extractable value (MEV) poses another hurdle in the way to the development of dark pools in DeFi. MEV refers to the extra profit earned by the miners and validator in return for reordering and adding transactions to blocks. In a way, this obstacle is also an extension of the nature of blockchains.\nDo Dark Pools Exist in Crypto?\nAlthough the crypto market and associated decentralized finance (DeFi) aim at anonymity, transparency is the hallmark of this market. Every transaction is visible on the blockchain network on which it was carried out. Owing to this reason, the idea of dark pool is essentially hard to implement in the crypto market. Yet, dark pools are not totally non-existent in the market of digital assets.\nAs mentioned earlier, the ideas started getting traction in the late 2010s. Since then, hidden trading mechanisms have been emerging in different forms. One of these major developments is the rise of institutional platforms that offer dark pool services for crypto whales. These platforms have full support from major liquidity and custody providers of the market. The purpose behind these platforms is the same as that in traditional markets, and that is to let the whales execute their orders fully before the trades are broadcast publicly.\nThe Rise of Hidden Liquidity in DeFi\nApart from the dedicated dark pool services mentioned in the preceding paragraph, investors have also devised additional ways to use hidden liquidity and execute their trades secretly. Certain DeFi protocols employ routing systems that hide trading details until they have been carried out. This method helps whales front-run the market and successfully avoid price fluctuations specifically resulting from selling or buyi"

                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed 2025 at record territory, extending a historic multi-year rally while quietly masking sharp internal divergence.\nCaterpillar (CAT) and Goldman Sachs (GS) stood out as the clear leaders in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) during 2025, delivering exceptional returns amid a year of volatility, AI-driven infrastructure demand, and favorable conditions for financials. Caterpillar surged as a hybrid play on traditional infrastructure recovery and the booming need for power generation in AI data centers, while Goldman Sachs benefited from robust deal-making, lower interest rates, and a resilient economy. These two stocks powered much of the index\u2019s momentum, even as broader mega-cap tech names delivered more modest gains.\nThis was not a year driven by broad optimism alone. It was a year defined by where growth was visible, how capital was deployed, and which companies could translate macro tailwinds into durable earnings momentum. The result was a market that rewarded precision over scale and infrastructure over applications.\nIn today\u2019s anchor feature, Disruption Banking gives a full breakdown of the Dow Jones\u2019 top winners, laggards, and the AI infrastructure forces that shaped the year 2025.\nDow Jones 2025 at a Glance: A 13% Gain That Extended a Multi-Year Winning Streak Slightly Behind the S&P 500\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) opened in 2025 at around 42,660 and closed at 48,063.29 on December 31, 2025, roughly a 13% gain for the year. Stocks set fresh records on AI enthusiasm and Fed easing, but not without shockwaves. A major April selloff, triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners, knocked the Dow 4% in a day.\nChief Market Strategist Daniel Morris of BNP Paribas Asset Management warned the tariff move was \u201cworse than most investors expected.\u201d Still, resilient earnings and two Fed rate cuts in Q4 2025 (totaling -0.50%) kept markets afloat. By year-end, the U.S. economy had resumed solid growth (Q3 GDP +4.3%) even as consumer spending slowed modestly and a bitter 43\u2011day government shutdown clouded data. Overall, the Dow\u2019s 2025 advance was strong but volatile, reflecting a narrow, tech-fueled surge and significant macroeconomic swings.\nSource: Bureau Of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce\nReuters reports that all major U.S. indexes ended 2025 with double-digit gains (third year in a row), thanks to \u201can insatiable appetite for artificial intelligence stocks.\u201d In fact, the Dow hit new highs on AI buying by year\u2019s end. But the rally was not uniform. Analysts note a \u201cnarrow\u201d group of mega\u2011caps drove much of the gain.\nIn short, 2025 repriced many companies: blockbuster tech leaders zoomed, while some defensive and cyclical stocks lagged or sank.\nDow Jones Winners of 2025: The 5 Stocks That Jumped 35%\u201360% on AI Infrastructure\nBelow are the Dow\u2019s top performers of 2025:\n- Caterpillar (CAT) (+59.5%). The industrial giant led the Dow after booming demand for construction and mining equipment.\n- Goldman Sachs (GS) (+55.8%).\n- Morgan Stanley (+44.3%).\n- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) (+43.5%). J&J\u2019s reliable cash flow (and 60+ years of dividend hikes) likely made it a safe haven amid turmoil.\n- Nvidia (NVDA) (+40.2%). As one of the newest Dow members (added November 2024), Nvidia rocketed on the AI frenzy. Its performance helped push the Dow to all-time highs.\n- International Business Machines (IBM) (+39.1%). Big Blue\u2019s years of restructuring towards hybrid cloud and AI platforms seem to be finally paying off. According to Disruption Banking, IBM\u2019s pivot from legacy hardware has \u201cadapted it to remain relevant.\u201d\nOther solid winners (+20%) included JPMorgan (+36.6%), and Boeing (+21.8%). These saw modest gains as housing and energy recovered, manufacturing rebounded, and credit stayed healthy.\nBanks (beyond Goldman and JPMorgan) were mixed: American Express (+24.6%) rose solidly, supported by fee income and some loan growth.

                "body": "Dow Jones Index Risk spikes today amid Wall Street data shock\n20.01.2026 - 05:56:39Even though today's net move in points and percentage may be relatively contained compared with recent wide swings, the intraday price spikes and reversals in DJIA live trading underscore the latent instability in US30 trading. In this kind of environment, apparent calm can be deceptive: liquidity can thin out suddenly, spreads can widen, and breakout moves can accelerate far faster than many retail traders expect.\nFor risk-takers: Trade Dow Jones volatility now\nWhy today's Dow Jones move matters\nToday's Wall Street news cycle is dominated by a combination of earnings and macro expectations that together define the immediate Dow Jones Forecast narrative. US investors are weighing the latest quarterly numbers from major blue-chip constituents and peers on Wall Street alongside closely watched macroeconomic indicators from recent sessions that directly influence the Fed's rate path.\nReports released over the past 24\u201372 hours on US inflation, labor-market conditions, and activity indicators have sharpened the debate about when and how aggressively the Federal Reserve might start cutting interest rates. Markets remain intensely sensitive to every hint in Fed commentary: stronger?than?expected data can revive fears that policy will stay tighter for longer, while softer releases raise concern about growth and earnings resilience. This tug?of?war is showing up in today's US30 trading as quick intraday reversals, gap risks around data releases, and sudden changes in sector leadership inside the Dow.\nOn top of macro drivers, company?specific news from high?profile US corporates \u2014 including industrial leaders, financials, and consumer names with heavy index weightings \u2014 is feeding directly into today's Wall Street news narrative. Earnings guidance, margin commentary, and outlook statements are being dissected tick by tick. A single disappointing outlook from a Dow heavyweight can shave triple?digit points off the index, while an upbeat surprise can spark an equally sharp short?covering rally. That asymmetry in reaction is a core component of current Dow Jones Index Risk.\nHow intraday risk builds up in Dow trading\nDuring the European morning, the Dow futures market often appears calm, but true volatility usually erupts around the US cash open at 15:30 CET (09:30 EST). That is when real money flows hit the tape, ETF rebalancing kicks in, and high?frequency strategies intensify activity. Even on a day when the headline change in the DJIA looks modest by the close, traders may experience violent swings in between: 100\u2013300 point intraday spikes are not unusual when key economic data or earnings conference calls cross the wires.\nFor traders focusing on DJIA live quotes, this means that tight intraday stops can be whipsawed, and leveraged positions can move from profit to loss in seconds. Slippage on stop orders can be material when liquidity briefly evaporates around news releases, and correlated moves across indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq) can amplify the pressure on the Dow. The risk is not just directional; volatility itself can expand suddenly, changing the payoff profile of any strategy that assumes stable intraday ranges.\nLeverage, widely used in index CFDs, further magnifies these dynamics. A 1% swing in the underlying Dow can translate into a disproportionately large profit or loss in a margined US30 position. When the market is headline?driven \u2014 as it is today, with traders braced for every new macro release and corporate headline \u2014 misjudging the timing or impact of news can turn a small intended exposure into a substantial financial shock.\nDow Jones Index Risk and the possibility of total loss\nToday's environment underscores why active traders must treat Dow Jones Index Risk with extreme caution. The combination of Fed?sensitive macro data, earnings uncertainty, and algorithmic flows may keep realized volatility elevated even if the final daily change in i"

                "body": "Netflix (NFLX) NASDAQ close $88.00 19 Jan 2026: NFLX stock faces earnings test\nNFLX stock closed at $88.00 on 19 Jan 2026 as investors positioned ahead of Netflix, Inc.\u2019s Q4 earnings. The share price sat between the session low of $87.78 and high of $88.51, with volume at 48,130,497.00 shares. Key metrics show EPS $2.39 and PE 36.82, and market attention will focus on subscriber trends, content spend and margin guidance. Our earnings spotlight connects these metrics to likely price reaction and analyst expectations ahead of the announcement\nEarnings preview: what to watch in NFLX stock\nNetflix reports after the close following a market cap of $372,884,453,920.00 and 222 million paid members globally. Watch paid net additions, ARPU guidance and content amortization. One clear trigger: positive subscriber growth above consensus would likely lift the stock; weaker additions or cautious guidance could pressure multiples. Expect management commentary on ad-tier growth and mobile-game monetization\nQ4 financials and metrics driving NFLX stock reaction\nTrailing metrics show revenue per share $10.22 and free cash flow per share $2.11, with operating margin near 29.14%. Netflix reported EPS $2.39 TTM and a forward PE around 36.82. These ratios imply the market prices durable growth; any downgrade in margin or cash-flow guidance will directly affect the valuation. Also monitor content spend trends and capital allocation comments\nValuation and risk: how cheap or expensive is NFLX stock\nPrice to sales is 8.60 and price to free cash flow is 41.58, indicating a premium relative to peers in Communication Services. Debt to equity sits at 0.56 and interest coverage is 17.21, showing manageable leverage but high valuation. If revenue growth slows, the P/E and P/FCF multiples may compress quickly. Prepare for volatility around guidance and subscriber cadence\nTechnical view and trading context for NFLX stock\nTechnicals show a short-term downtrend: RSI 9.53 and ADX 77.68 point to strong momentum to the downside. The 50-day average is $99.70 and the 200-day average is $113.08, both above the close. Daily volume of 48,130,497.00 exceeded average volume 45,677,190.00, indicating higher engagement into earnings. Traders should expect wider intraday ranges after the report\nAnalyst consensus and price-target signals for NFLX stock\nBrokerage counts show 47 buys, 14 holds, and 2 sells, implying a buy-leaning consensus. There is no single consensus price target in the feed, so watch post-earnings revisions. Our scenario targets range from a conservative $130.00 base case to a bull case near $220.00, and a bear case at $70.00. These targets reflect different assumptions on subscriber traction and margin recovery\nMeyka AI grade and forecast for NFLX stock\nMeyka AI rates NFLX with a score of 72.83 out of 100 \u2014 Grade B+ (BUY). This grade factors S&P 500 and sector comparisons, financial growth, key metrics, analyst consensus and forecasts. Meyka AI\u2019s forecast model projects a monthly price of $221.02, implying 151.14% upside from the current $88.00. Forecasts are model-based projections and not guarantees. We include this grade to frame relative conviction and risks\nFinal Thoughts\nNetflix closed the session at $88.00 on 19 Jan 2026 with investors focused on the Q4 earnings release. Short-term technicals point to downside momentum while fundamentals show solid margins and cash generation: EPS $2.39, operating margin 29.14%, and free cash flow per share $2.11. Analyst positioning is skewed to buy, but valuation metrics (P/S 8.60, P/FCF 41.58) leave limited room for error. Our scenario range sets a conservative price target of $130.00 (upside 47.73%) and a bull forecast aligned with Meyka AI\u2019s model at $221.02 (upside 151.14%). Remember the balance: strong content and international growth are opportunities, while high multiples and sensitivity to guidance are risks.

                "body": "MYR Group's (NASDAQ:MYRG) 31% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same five-year period\nThe worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the MYR Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MYRG) share price has soared 284% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter.\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for MYR Group investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver half a decade, MYR Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 31% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that MYR Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think MYR Group will grow revenue in the future.\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that MYR Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 69% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 31% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for MYR Group that you should be aware of before investing here.\nBut note: MYR Group may not be the best stock to buy.

                "body": "In the current market session, The Campbell's Inc. (NASDAQ:CPB) price is at $26.10, after a 0.08% increase. However, over the past month, the stock fell by 5.78%, and in the past year, by 33.23%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.\nThe Campbell's P/E Compared to Competitors\nThe P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued.\nCompared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 19.86 in the Food Products industry, The Campbell's Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 13.44. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.\nIn summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes.\n\u00a9 2026 Benzinga.com.

Federal funding crunch could change that\n-\nClick here to listen to this article - Share via\n- L.A. defense-tech startups like Gambit face funding shortfalls as the Small Business Innovation Research program expired in September amid a Capitol Hill dispute.\n- The timing is problematic for the Trump administration, which is prioritizing speed in weapons development and innovation from private-sector defense companies.\nWhen former Space X engineer Josh Giegel launched his North Hollywood tech company Gambit in 2023, he had a vision for the battlefield of the future, one with fewer soldiers and more AI-driven assets.\nAerospace companies are sprouting all across Southern California, breathing new life into an industry that once powered the regional economy.\nHis software would allow unmanned tanks and swarms of armed drones to communicate and adapt in real time \u2014 without human intervention.\nThe company now employs more than a dozen people and has contracts with the military, which is testing his software. But its growth has been clouded because of a funding dispute on Capitol Hill over the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which provides companies seed capital to develop new technology that can assist the government. Funding for it and related programs expired in September.\nThe seed fund has been vital to many local tech startups. Gambit received $3.3 million from the program early on and was hoping to get another $5 million of the Small Business Administration money, which is allocated by the military.\n\u201cThat funding really helps companies like ours that are putting tech into warfighters\u2019 hands,\u201d Giegel said. \u201cLosing that money becomes more leg work to find other sources.\u201d\nGambit\u2019s predicament is widely shared across Southern California, which has experienced a proliferation of tech startups launched by SpaceX alumni and other entrepreneurs with the support of SBA money.\nIn 2024, 124 contracts worth $173 million were awarded to 71 California companies through SpaceWERX, an El Segundo-based arm of the Space Force that distributes SBA funding to innovative defense startups.\nThe money also is disbursed by other branches of the military and departments of the government, which do not take stakes in the companies. Gambit received funds through the Air Force.\nOther local recipients of SBA funding include Costa Mesa autonomous weapons maker Anduril Industries, now valued at more than $30 billion; and satellite platform manufacturers K2 Space in Torrance and Apex Space in Los Angeles.\nSouthern California defense startups are receiving millions in funding as Silicon Valley venture capital firms and legacy tech giants do an about-turn on the sector.\nThe funds are allocated in phases, with initial feasibility awards up to about $300,000 and as much as $2 million for the development of prototypes. A maximum of $15 million is available through a companion SBA-funded program if the companies can bring in other funding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can name a single company that I work with, or that I know of, that did not start with SBIR\u201d funding, said Maggie Gray, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Shield Capital, which invested in Apex. \u201cWe see SBIR as a crucial part of the defense-tech ecosystem. It\u2019s kind of the way to get your initial foot in the door with the government.\u201d\nEstablished in 1982, the SBA program provides more than $4 billion to government departments, with the military receiving the lion\u2019s share. But SBA funding ran out on Sept. 30 as lawmakers clashed over proposed reforms.\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, introduced a bill that would set a $75-million lifetime cap on funds for individual companies and establish performance benchmarks. The bill also would beef up due diligence to prevent new technology falling into the hands of foreign adversaries and end diversity, equity and inclusion preferences in funds"

                "body": "Nikkei 225 Index at risk as Citi warns on BoJ rate hikes\nThe Nikkei 225 Index retreated by over 1.2% on Tuesday, continuing a downtrend that has been going on in the past few days. It retreated to a low of \u00a552,930, down from the year-to-date high of \u00a554,515. This retreat may continue if the Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintains a highly hawkish tone as Citi expects.\nCiti expects three BoJ rate hikes this year\nThe Nikkei 225 Index dropped by over 1.2%, mirroring the performance of other top global indices that slipped amid the rising geopolitical issues between the United States and Europe.\nIt also retreated after a report by Citigroup predicted that the BoJ would maintain a highly hawkish tone this year. The bank expects that the bank will deliver three rate hikes this year, a move that would push the benchmark rate from 0.75% to 1.50%.\nCiti sees the bank hiking rates this high because of the deteriorating Japanese yen, which has been in a freefall in the past few months. The USDJPY exchange rate rose to a multi-year high of 159.47, up by nearly 14% from its lowest level in 2025. A Citi analyst said:\n\u201cPut simply, the yen\u2019s weakness is being driven by negative real interest rates. The BOJ has no choice other than to address this if it wants to reverse the exchange rate\u2019s direction.\u201d\nThe hawkish BoJ view has led to a surge in Japan bond yields. Data shows that the ten-year yield jumped to 2.32%, its highest level in decades and much higher than the pandemic low of minus 0.27%. The five-year yield has jumped to 1.70%, its highest point in years, while the 40-year soared to 4%\nIn most cases, the stock market tends to underperform when a central bank is highly hawkish and when bond yields are on a strong upward trajectory. Indeed, there are chances that Japanese institutions will start owning investments from abroad into fixed-income assets at home. This view will accelerate if the five-year and ten-year yield moves above inflation.\nJapanese election ahead\nMeanwhile, there is still uncertainty ahead of the upcoming Japanese election scheduled for February. Sanae Takaichi called the election so that she can get a proper mandate.\nAt the same time, her election pledges, including suspending a 8% food levy risks widening the fiscal gap and leading to higher bond yields. Indeed, yields have jumped sharply since she unveiled her $135 billion stimulus package.\nOn the positive side, Japan stocks may benefit from the upcoming Supreme Court decision on Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Most analysts believe that the court will decide to end these tariffs, a move that will benefit Japanese companies that sell to the United States.\nNikkei 225 Index technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the Nikkei 225 Index has rebounded in the past few weeks, moving from a low of \u00a548,160 in November to the current \u00a552,990.\nIt is now aiming to retest the key support level at \u00a552,656, its highest swing on November 4. A break-and-retest is one of the most common continuation signs in technical analysis.\nTherefore, the index will likely remain in a tight range in the coming days and then resume the upward trend."
