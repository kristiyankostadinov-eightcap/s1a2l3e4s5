                "body": "Gold price climbs to approximately $4,040 during the early Asian session on Monday. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China support the metal\u2019s value. Traders await the US government\u2019s reopening and subsequent data impacting Federal Reserve policy decisions.\nTrade Tensions And The Federal Reserve\nTrade tensions rise due to President Trump\u2019s new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports effective from November 1. China\u2019s warning of retaliation adds to the economic uncertainty, affecting the dollar and benefiting safe-haven assets like gold. The Federal Reserve is expected to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points in both October and December, with a 97% probability for the October rate cut, per the CME FedWatch tool. These expectations make gold attractive due to reduced opportunity cost.\nKey US economic reports such as Retail Sales and Producer Price Index will be released Thursday, potentially impacting the US dollar and gold prices based on inflation readings. Central banks, primarily from emerging economies, continue to hold significant Gold reserves, adding 1,136 tonnes worth $70 billion in 2022.\nThe price of gold is influenced by geopolitical factors, interest rates, and the behavior of the US dollar. A weaker dollar tends to push gold prices up, while higher interest rates can suppress demand. The article also explains gold\u2019s inverse relation to the US dollar and Treasuries, affecting its demand as a safe-haven asset.\nWith gold currently trading around $4,040, we see this momentum continuing due to renewed US-China trade friction over technology export controls. Recent data shows the US trade deficit with China widened by 6% in the third quarter of 2025, providing a fundamental reason for the current geopolitical tension. This environment strongly supports safe-haven assets.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s expected policy adds fuel to this fire, as we anticipate a rate cut in the coming months. Market pricing, reflected in the CME FedWatch tool, shows an 85% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the November 2025 meeting. Weaker monetary policy typically pressures the dollar and boosts non-yielding assets like gold.\nStrategies For Traders\nFor derivative traders, this suggests positioning for further upside in the coming weeks. Long call options or bull call spreads could be effective strategies to capitalize on expected price increases while managing risk. Implied volatility in gold options has risen to 22, reflecting the market\u2019s anticipation of significant price movement.\nLooking back, we remember how similar trade disputes in the late 2010s repeatedly caused spikes in the gold price, as investors fled riskier assets for safety. History shows us that these geopolitical standoffs often have a prolonged effect, creating a sustained bid for gold. The current situation feels very familiar and provides a clear historical pattern to follow.\nUnderpinning this rally is the relentless purchasing by global central banks, which provides a strong floor for the price. Reports from the World Gold Council confirm that central banks have added another 800 tonnes through the third quarter of 2025, continuing the strong trend we saw back in 2022. This consistent demand limits the potential for any significant price declines.\nThis week, we will be closely watching the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data due on Thursday. Any indication of cooling inflation will reinforce the market\u2019s expectation for a Fed rate cut and could serve as the next catalyst to push gold higher. A soft PPI reading would likely weaken the US dollar and benefit gold directly."

                "body": "Gold and silver are poised for a volatile week ahead as investors navigate the interplay between domestic festive buying, physical market premiums, and crucial macroeconomic developments in the US, analysts said.\nWith Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, set to comment on policy on Tuesday, bullion markets are expected to closely track any cues on inflation, interest rates, and broader monetary policy, PTI reported.\n\u201cIn the next week, focus will be on the physical demand for bullion during the festive season in India along with global political and geo-political developments, particularly the passage of the US spending bill and efforts to resume diplomacy on ending the Russia-Ukraine war. These factors are likely to shape gold price trends in the coming months,\u201d said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd, PTI quoted.\nMer noted that\ngold prices ended last week on a positive note, but volatility remained elevated, with sharp corrections followed by renewed buying at lower levels. \u201cThis was expected and will continue as the bulls and bears fight out at market tops,\u201d he added.\nConcerns over US trade policies have also continued to influence investor sentiment. \u201cThere has not been much change on the fundamental side with uncertainty over US trade tariffs still being in place. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement to levy tariffs on China has again pushed up safe-haven demand,\u201d Mer said.\nLast week, gold prices rallied by Rs 3,251, or 2.75 per cent, reaching a record Rs 1,23,677 per 10 grams on Thursday before retreating slightly toward the week\u2019s close on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX).\n\u201cGold prices have had an astonishing rally in recent months, with a year-to-date gain of more than 50 per cent in 2025. This prompted investors to take profits on Thursday, triggering a correction of more than Rs 3,000 from highs of Rs 1,23,677 per 10 grams, which contributed to extreme volatility in the yellow metal,\u201d said Prathamesh Mallya, DVP-Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies, Angel One.\nUS monetary policy remains a key driver. Pankaj Singh, Founder & Principal Researcher of SmartWealth.ai, noted that minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting reinforced expectations of a prolonged inflationary bias and balance-sheet reduction, both supporting gold prices.\nOn the international front, Comex gold futures for December delivery closed marginally higher at $4,000.4 per ounce after hitting $4,081 midweek. Spot gold similarly rose by 1.06 per cent to $4,018.30 per ounce before briefly touching $4,059.34 per ounce.\n\u201cThe week began with bullion extending gains on safe-haven flows as markets hedged against persistent US fiscal risks and speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path. However, sentiment shifted midweek,\u201d said Riya Singh, Research Analyst, Commodities and Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.\nDespite short-term cooling, analysts remain constructive on the broader trajectory. \u201cGold is still on track for its eighth consecutive weekly advance, up nearly 14 per cent this quarter, reflecting sustained investor preference for tangible assets amid concerns over US debt exceeding $36 trillion, and rising inflation expectations despite slowing economic growth,\u201d Singh added.\nPhysical demand from Asia moderated last week, as high prices deterred fresh buying, particularly in China and India, where import premiums narrowed. Analysts said the short-term outlook will hinge on upcoming US inflation readings and Federal Reserve commentary.\nSilver continued its historic rally, albeit with elevated volatility. On the MCX, silver prices rose by Rs 722, or 0.49 per cent, last week, touching an all-time high of Rs 1,53,388 per kilogram on Thursday. Internationally, Comex silver futures for December delivery hit $49.96 per ounce, while spot silver briefly breached $51 per ounce before retreating to close at $50.29 per ounce.\n\u201cSilver\u2019s hi"

                "body": "Understanding the Gold-Interest Rate Relationship\nThe relationship between interest rates and gold prices is multifaceted, involving several economic mechanisms that work simultaneously. In this context, the impact of interest rate changes on gold prices is a central concern for investors. Furthermore, research from the World Gold Council reveals that gold competes with interest-bearing investments and creates complex dynamics in global portfolios. For instance, an all-time high analysis confirms evolving trends.\nThe conventional wisdom suggests a simple inverse correlation. However, statistical analysis shows that the relationship is far more nuanced. According to research, gold\u2019s price movement is only about 16% correlated with real interest rate changes. Therefore, 84% of the movement is driven by other factors, emphasising the importance of a holistic approach.\nWhat Drives the Connection Between Gold and Interest Rates?\nGold's status as a non-yield-bearing asset creates a fundamental divide from interest-bearing investments. Historical data from the Federal Reserve illustrates that this relationship evolves over time. In addition, the World Gold Council notes that gold and interest rates often react to similar underlying economic conditions. For example, both may respond similarly during periods of economic upheaval.\nA recent study highlighted that during periods of economic stress, investors tend to reallocate funds from bonds to gold. This shift is partly explained by the psychological comfort of holding precious metals. In addition, investors often search for a historic price surge during volatile times.\nThe Opportunity Cost Mechanism\nInterest rate changes directly affect the opportunity cost of holding gold. Unlike bonds or bank deposits, physical gold generates no passive income. Consequently, investors must constantly evaluate the financial trade-offs. When central banks raise rates, yields on cash deposits increase, reducing gold\u2019s relative appeal. Conversely, when rates fall, gold becomes a more attractive store of value.\nFurthermore, as rates decrease, gold offers an alternative opportunity with record highs as inflation hedge. This phenomenon is a key driver behind shifts in investor behaviour, as demonstrated in various risk management studies conducted in recent years.\nHow Different Types of Interest Rates Impact Gold\nNot all interest rates affect gold in the same way. The distinction between nominal and real rates, as well as the duration of rate changes, creates a complex web of influences on gold price movements. In addition, the nuances in these rates reflect different market sentiments and economic indicators.\nNominal vs. Real Interest Rates: Which Matters More?\nWhile nominal interest rates receive much media attention, real interest rates (nominal minus inflation) show a stronger correlation with gold price movements. Research indicates that real yields on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities provide a consistent perspective on gold\u2019s performance. When real yields fall into negative territory, gold becomes particularly attractive\u2014a sentiment echoed by numerous analysts.\nA side-by-side comparison shows:\n- Nominal Rate: The stated interest rate without inflation adjustment; moderate correlation.\n- Real Rate: Nominal rate minus inflation rate; strong correlation.\n- Federal Funds Rate: Benchmark rate set by central banks; influences market expectations indirectly.\nShort-Term vs. Long-Term Rate Changes\nThe duration of interest rate changes significantly influences gold\u2019s response.\n- Short-term rate changes: Gold often shows delayed or muted reactions.\n- Long-term rate trends: Sustained changes typically produce more evident shifts in gold prices.\n- Yield curve dynamics: These provide additional signals about the market direction.\nMoreover, when rates fall, investors note that gold can act as an effective alternative investment, echoing findings in price forecast insights.\nHistorical Analysis: Gold\u2019s"

According to a trader at Iceberg X, cautious attitudes are dominating, especially as local production ramps up. The impact stretches far beyond Malaysia: soyoil and palm oil futures also dropped on China\u2019s Dalian Commodity Exchange, while US soyoil prices firmed up. Since palm oil directly competes with other edible oils, price moves in one market quickly spill into others. Meanwhile, crude oil prices have rebounded, boosting the case for palm oil as a biodiesel ingredient. But despite Malaysia\u2019s exports jumping nearly 20% in early October, official forecasts still see average prices cooling next year amid expanding output worldwide.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Edible oil prices keep investors guessing.\nThe edible oil market is at a crossroads, as investors balance fears of oversupply with hopes for a rebound tied to energy prices and export strength. With Malaysia\u2019s ringgit holding steady against the US dollar and export numbers jumping early this month, traders see near-term price softness but are watching technical signals for stabilization above 4,500 ringgit per ton. Volatility looks set to stick around as other global oilseed prices and crude oil both sway the direction.\nThe bigger picture: Energy and trade trends shape the future.\nPalm oil sits at the heart of global trends in both food and fuel. The Malaysian government expects average prices to dip to between 3,900 and 4,100 ringgit per ton next year as output climbs among the world\u2019s biggest producers. If crude oil keeps gaining, demand for palm oil in biodiesel could pick up. But global economic policy and US-China trade negotiations will remain critical wildcards for prices in the months ahead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

As we have noted before:\n\u201cThe \u201ctriangle\u201d is one of the most reliable \u2018technical\u2019 indicators in commodity markets. It highlights the battle between the bulls and bears, and describes how the range is narrowing \u2013 until one side \u201cwins\u201d and the other side gives up. At which point, prices usually start to move a long way.\nIt has certainly proved a good guide to oil markets in recent years, as we have monitored here.\u201d\nINVENTORIES HAVE BEEN BUILDING AT SEA AND IN CHINA\nChina\u2019s crude oil stockpiling vs OPEC+ ouput\nThe top chart highlights the size of the current inventory build. As Bloomberg notes:\n\u201cThe total amount of oil in transit climbed to 1.2 bn bbls, according to Vortexa data, the highest since at least 2016. If ships carrying oil but not moving are added, the figure is the highest since 2020. Then a global pandemic ravaged demand and traders stored barrels on everything from giant supertankers to tiny barges.\u201d\nAt the same time, China has been rapidly expanding its own storage as the Reuters chart shows. It is aiming to have 1bn bbls in storage \u2013 versus the US at 404mbbls.\nReuters estimates today\u2019s volume at 909mbbls and reports:\n\u201cChina has stockpiled an average of 530,000 barrels per day thus far in 2025 and is soaking up surplus global supply. This is supporting prices as the OPEC+ producers group winds down production cuts.\u201d\nTHE US EIA IS FORECASTING LOWER PRICES THROUGH 2026\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price and NYMEX futures price dollars per barrel\nEven the US government\u2019s Energy Information Administration expects prices to fall, as their chart shows:\n\u201cWe expect global oil inventories to rise through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. We forecast that the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $62 per barrel (b) in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $52/b in 2026.\u201d\nThe issue for OPEC, as the International Energy Agency notes in its latest Report is that:\n\u201cNon-OPEC+ oil supply growth continues apace, with output from the United States, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina at or near all-time highs. Non-OPEC+ producers are now on track to boost production by 1.4 mb/d in 2025 and by just over 1 mb/d next year.\u201c\nOPEC plans to add another 2.3mbd over the same period.\nGlobal output is therefore expected to grow by 4.7mbd in 2025-6, whilst demand is only forecast to grow 1.4mbd.\nSTORING OIL IS NOW MORE EXPENSIVE WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES\nStoring oil is good news for shipowners, of course. But it is more expensive than when it was last used in 2020 during Covid.\n- Interest rates are much higher today, as Bloomberg notes\n- Prices will need to fall into contango (where today\u2019s prices are lower than for future delivery)\n- Otherwise traders can\u2019t afford to store the product\nAnd, of course, the Gaza peace deal may well add further pressure if it reduces tensions in the Middle East. A nuclear deal with Iran might come back to the table. And Houthi attacks in the Red Sea might also reduce.\nFalling prices are also reducing short-term demand, as companies destock down the value chain.\nDemand is already weaker than usual in Q4 due to the Trade War. Destocking will further reduce it in the run-up to Christmas."

Crude Oil prices received support after United States (US) President Donald Trump shared some conciliatory remarks on Sunday, following Friday\u2019s tariff threats on China. The renewed trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies weighed on global economic growth and Oil demand.\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social on Sunday, noting that China\u2019s economy \u201cwill be fine\u201d and that the US wants to \u201chelp China, not hurt it.\u201d On Sunday, Trump said that there\u2019s no need to meet China\u2019s President Xi Jinping at the upcoming South Korea summit and threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. China also responded by warning to retaliate if Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.\nOil prices also faced challenges amid easing supply concerns following Trump\u2019s Sunday declaration that the Gaza conflict is over, ahead of hostage releases and his planned address to Israel\u2019s parliament. Trump is set to receive a hero\u2019s welcome in Israel\u2019s parliament on Monday as the Gaza ceasefire he helped broker enters its fourth day, with the anticipated release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners marking cautious progress in the long-standing conflict, according to Reuters.\nChina's annual crude Oil imports advanced 3.9% in September as refineries operated at their highest utilization rates this year. China brought in 47.25 million metric tons of Oil in September, or the equivalent of 11.5 million barrels per day, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings.

                "body": "Palm oil futures fell as investors anticipated higher inventories, while rising crude oil and rival edible oil moves added fresh pressure.\n17 minutes ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nPalm oil futures in Malaysia slipped for the second straight session, with the benchmark contract down 1.72% to 4,466 ringgit per metric ton, as traders prepared for climbing inventories and fluctuating edible oil prices worldwide.\nWhat does this mean?\nPalm oil is feeling the squeeze from expectations that Malaysian inventories will climb, leaving investors wary. According to a trader at Iceberg X, cautious attitudes are dominating, especially as local production ramps up. The impact stretches far beyond Malaysia: soyoil and palm oil futures also dropped on China\u2019s Dalian Commodity Exchange, while US soyoil prices firmed up. Since palm oil directly competes with other edible oils, price moves in one market quickly spill into others. Meanwhile, crude oil prices have rebounded, boosting the case for palm oil as a biodiesel ingredient. But despite Malaysia\u2019s exports jumping nearly 20% in early October, official forecasts still see average prices cooling next year amid expanding output worldwide.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Edible oil prices keep investors guessing.\nThe edible oil market is at a crossroads, as investors balance fears of oversupply with hopes for a rebound tied to energy prices and export strength. With Malaysia\u2019s ringgit holding steady against the US dollar and export numbers jumping early this month, traders see near-term price softness but are watching technical signals for stabilization above 4,500 ringgit per ton. Volatility looks set to stick around as other global oilseed prices and crude oil both sway the direction.\nThe bigger picture: Energy and trade trends shape the future.\nPalm oil sits at the heart of global trends in both food and fuel. The Malaysian government expects average prices to dip to between 3,900 and 4,100 ringgit per ton next year as output climbs among the world\u2019s biggest producers. If crude oil keeps gaining, demand for palm oil in biodiesel could pick up. But global economic policy and US-China trade negotiations will remain critical wildcards for prices in the months ahead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

As we have noted before:\n\u201cThe \u201ctriangle\u201d is one of the most reliable \u2018technical\u2019 indicators in commodity markets. It highlights the battle between the bulls and bears, and describes how the range is narrowing \u2013 until one side \u201cwins\u201d and the other side gives up. At which point, prices usually start to move a long way.\nIt has certainly proved a good guide to oil markets in recent years, as we have monitored here.\u201d\nINVENTORIES HAVE BEEN BUILDING AT SEA AND IN CHINA\nChina\u2019s crude oil stockpiling vs OPEC+ ouput\nThe top chart highlights the size of the current inventory build. As Bloomberg notes:\n\u201cThe total amount of oil in transit climbed to 1.2 bn bbls, according to Vortexa data, the highest since at least 2016. If ships carrying oil but not moving are added, the figure is the highest since 2020. Then a global pandemic ravaged demand and traders stored barrels on everything from giant supertankers to tiny barges.\u201d\nAt the same time, China has been rapidly expanding its own storage as the Reuters chart shows. It is aiming to have 1bn bbls in storage \u2013 versus the US at 404mbbls.\nReuters estimates today\u2019s volume at 909mbbls and reports:\n\u201cChina has stockpiled an average of 530,000 barrels per day thus far in 2025 and is soaking up surplus global supply. This is supporting prices as the OPEC+ producers group winds down production cuts.\u201d\nTHE US EIA IS FORECASTING LOWER PRICES THROUGH 2026\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price and NYMEX futures price dollars per barrel\nEven the US government\u2019s Energy Information Administration expects prices to fall, as their chart shows:\n\u201cWe expect global oil inventories to rise through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. We forecast that the Brent crude oil price will fall to an average of $62 per barrel (b) in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $52/b in 2026.\u201d\nThe issue for OPEC, as the International Energy Agency notes in its latest Report is that:\n\u201cNon-OPEC+ oil supply growth continues apace, with output from the United States, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina at or near all-time highs. Non-OPEC+ producers are now on track to boost production by 1.4 mb/d in 2025 and by just over 1 mb/d next year.\u201c\nOPEC plans to add another 2.3mbd over the same period.\nGlobal output is therefore expected to grow by 4.7mbd in 2025-6, whilst demand is only forecast to grow 1.4mbd.\nSTORING OIL IS NOW MORE EXPENSIVE WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES\nStoring oil is good news for shipowners, of course. But it is more expensive than when it was last used in 2020 during Covid.\n- Interest rates are much higher today, as Bloomberg notes\n- Prices will need to fall into contango (where today\u2019s prices are lower than for future delivery)\n- Otherwise traders can\u2019t afford to store the product\nAnd, of course, the Gaza peace deal may well add further pressure if it reduces tensions in the Middle East. A nuclear deal with Iran might come back to the table. And Houthi attacks in the Red Sea might also reduce.\nFalling prices are also reducing short-term demand, as companies destock down the value chain.\nDemand is already weaker than usual in Q4 due to the Trade War. Destocking will further reduce it in the run-up to Christmas."

                "body": "There have been discussions around fracking in the U.K. for years, with the government going back and forth on whether to support new operations. Politicians have explored the potential for fracking, which has been successful for fossil fuel recovery in the United States, while environmentalists have fought against it. While many may have thought that fracking had been banned long ago in the U.K., a decisive ban on the practice had not actually taken place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 until now.\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It requires drilling into the earth to direct a high-pressure mixture of water, sand, and chemicals at a rock layer, to release the gas inside. Wells can be drilled both vertically and horizontally to release the gas. The practice is controversial as the injection of fluid at high pressure into the rock can cause earth tremors - small movements in the earth's surface. In addition, fracking requires huge quantities of water.\nIn recent years, in the U.K., the government has been back and forth on its fracking policy. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss put it back on the table, in the hope of attracting greater funding for fossil fuel production. However, just a month later, her successor Rishi Sunak reinstated the previous moratorium on the practice. Ahead of the 2024 general election, in the Labour Party manifesto, the political party stated plans to ban fracking for good if it came into power.\nIn addition to environmental concerns, experts suggest that the U.K. terrain is simply not suitable for fracking. Chris Cornelius, the geologist who founded the U.K.'s first fracking company, Cuadrilla Resources, told media sources that the government's support for the practice was merely a \"political gesture\" and that \"I don't think there is any chance of fracking in the U.K. in the near term.\"\nFrom 2004 to 2010, there was an early exploration of fracking in England. Cornelius said that while undertaking exploratory drilling, Cuadrilla discovered that the geology of the U.K. was unsuited to widespread fracking operations. He suggested that no sensible investors would fund operations, as \"It's very challenging geology, compared with North America,\" which is more well-suited to fracking operations.\nWhile the U.S. has large, flat, thick shale formations, which are relatively simple to drill into and extract gas from, the U.K. has thinner, more geologically complex and heavily faulted and folded shale formations. The U.K. geology makes it more difficult to drill, exacerbating the threat of earthquakes, as well as making for lower yields.\nRelated: Oil Prices Drop Dramatically on Oversupply Fears and U.S. Demand Risks\nNow, the U.K. Labour government plans to ban fracking once and for all. In October, Energy Minister Ed Miliband announced that Labour was accelerating plans to introduce a \"total ban\" on fracking. The Party aims to introduce the ban this autumn. While the current government never planned to permit new fracking projects, the move is mainly directed at preventing the right-wing, populist Reform Party from making such a move if it should come into power.\nAt present, the U.K. energy minister is permitted to lift the fracking moratorium without a vote in parliament. However, a change in the law would mean that the government would need to put it to a vote and convince the majority of MPs to support fracking, which would be more difficult.\nSeveral communities across the U.K. have spoken out against fracking proposals due to fears of the earthquakes, disruption, and blight to the countryside it causes. Around 187 constituencies across the U.K. that sit above shale gas could be affected by fracking if it were permitted. Miliband now aims to raise awareness about the potential threat of fracking through his countrywide \"send the frackers packing\" campaign.\nThe Reform Party, which has grown in popularity over the last year, largely due to its strong stance on immigration and bold pro"

The US Dollar (USD) surged on the back of risk aversion, triggered by political woes on both shores of the Atlantic.\nFrance Prime Minister resigns\nMarkets kicked off Monday with some worrisome headlines coming from France. Prime Minister (PM) S\u00e9bastien Lecornu resigned less than a day after his cabinet was announced. The political crisis in France began over a year ago, when President Emmanuel Macron called for snap parliamentary elections, claiming France\u2019s government needed \u201ca clear majority in serenity and harmony.\u201d However, the election ended with a big increase in far-right lawmakers and a hung parliament. The voting \"brought more division to the National Assembly rather than solutions for the French people,\" Macron acknowledged a few months later.\nLecornu is the fifth PM to resign amid the inability to pass a budget through Parliament to bear with France's massive debt, which now exceeds \u20ac3 trillion, equivalent to approximately 114% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nMacron asked Lecornu to remain in office and try to form a coalition government, but he failed miserably. In fact, far-right leader Marine Le Pen clearly stated that she would thwart any action by a new government, calling for fresh snap elections. The news negatively affected the Euro (EUR).\nJapan\u2019s leadership boost US Dollar demand\nIn the meantime, the US Dollar (USD) received an unexpected boost from Japanese headlines. The Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old lawmaker, positioning her to become Japan's first female Prime Minister. The news heavily weighed on the JPY, with the USD/JPY pair gaping roughly 300 pips up at the weekly opening and pushing the Greenback higher across the board. The JPY plummeted on speculation that Takaichi would vow to increase federal spending and a looser monetary policy.\nBy the end of the week, however, her future as PM was put in doubt after Japan\u2019s ruling coalition broke up on Friday. The LDP holds the largest majority of seats, but it\u2019s short of a majority. For the past 26 years, it has formed a coalition with the Komeito party, which ended after the head of Komeito, Tetsuo Saito, said the LDP failed to provide sufficient answers regarding political funding issues. The JPY recovered modestly with the news, but the broad USD keeps USD/JPY up by roughly 500 pips by the end of the week.\nUnited States government remains closed\nAnd of course, the United States (US) government shutdown that began on October 1 continued. Throughout the week, the Senate has met multiple times to vote on a funding bill, to no avail. Early in the week, US President Donald Trump warned about looming massive federal layoffs, blaming Democrats for the matter. Financial markets fared relatively well with the fact that the US government is on pause until Thursday, when the latest round of failed votes in Congress triggered panic and sent the USD sharply up.\nIn the meantime, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released the Minutes of the September meeting. The USD suffered a temporary setback afterwards, as the document showed policymakers are split on how to proceed next. For a slim majority, ten out of nineteen members favor two more interest rate cuts before the year's end. The decision to trim the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) was pretty much unanimous amid a weakening labor market.\n\u201cParticipants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely "

                "body": "EUR/USD: Two-Month Lows, a Fragile Bounce, and a Macro Gauntlet Ahead\nEUR/USD Price Map: From 1.1800 Faded to 1.1540 Printed\nEUR/USD shed altitude from mid-September peaks above 1.1800 and printed a two-month trough near 1.1540 before clawing back to roughly 1.1620 into the weekend. That sequence tells you positioning was leaning short into U.S. policy risk and tariff headlines, then partially unwound as haven flows into the dollar ebbed intraday. Price is operating inside a tight, tradable corridor that has repeatedly mattered for intraday desks: 1.1571 on the downside has acted as a speculative pivot, while the 1.1710 neighborhood caps rebounds when U.S. yields stabilize. Immediate friction stacked at 1.1630, 1.1690, and 1.1725 has contained every bounce since Wednesday; a daily close above 1.1700 is the first sign the bulls are doing more than just covering.\nTrend, Momentum, and Structure: Why the 1.1700 Ceiling Still Matters for EUR/USD\nThe pair remains under its 50- and 100-day moving averages, a configuration that typically keeps countertrend rallies short-lived until proven otherwise. The 200-day sits much lower\u2014near 1.1220\u2014reminding longer-term players that the primary up-move from early summer has already surrendered a chunk of its cushion. Momentum has stabilized but not turned: RSI near 47 has exited oversold conditions without breaking above the mid-50s where enduring upside impulses usually begin. That puts the burden of proof on buyers to convert 1.1700 from cap to floor; until then, rallies into 1.1630\u20131.1725 attract supply.\nMacro Shock Mix: 100% Tariff Threats, a U.S. Shutdown, and a Divided Fed\nThree catalysts reset the dollar narrative in a single week. First, renewed trade-war rhetoric out of Washington\u2014including a stated intent to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports\u2014ignited a classic risk-off impulse that initially favored the dollar and knocked pro-growth FX. Second, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has throttled official data flow and amplified uncertainty around near-term growth. Third, FOMC minutes revealed a committee split on the pace of easing even as markets ascribe high odds to at least one 25 bp cut by late October. This push-pull left EUR/USD whipsawed: the pair slid under 1.1600 on Thursday as havens bid, then recovered toward 1.1620 Friday when equities stabilized and rate-cut expectations firmed. The bottom line is simple and price-relevant: if tariffs escalate from threat to timetable while the shutdown lingers, the growth hit can keep risk assets heavy and keep the dollar bid on stress days; if the Fed guides toward cuts with conviction, U.S. yields slip and the euro finds air above 1.1600.\nEurope\u2019s Counterweight: France\u2019s Reset, Germany\u2019s Soft Patch, and What It Means for EUR/USD\nEuro-side news has not provided a decisive floor. French political turbulence\u2014triggered by the prime minister\u2019s resignation and then a rapid reappointment\u2014temporarily dented sentiment before easing late week. Germany\u2019s latest factory orders and industrial production readings reinforced a sluggish growth profile, a backdrop that restrains how far the euro can run without a stronger U.S. yield-curve impulse. At the policy level, ECB commentary that disinflation is largely on track and policy is \u201cin a good place\u201d reduces the likelihood of hawkish surprises. Translation for EUR/USD pricing: Europe isn\u2019t supplying upside torque; the pair\u2019s larger swings still hinge on U.S. rates, Washington\u2019s tariff path, and global risk appetite.\nEvent Risk Heatmap: EUR/USD Faces CPI, PPI, Retail Sales; Euro HICP and ZEW in the Frame\nThe data slate is loaded in a way that can reprice both sides of the cross. In the U.S., CPI, PPI, and Retail Sales cluster into a high-volatility window. A softer CPI-PPI sequence alongside weaker retail demand typically drags Treasury yields down the curve and weakens the dollar, giving EUR/USD a shot at 1.1690\u20131.1725.

Spot prices trade just above mid-1.3300s during the Asian session and look to build on Friday's goodish rebound from the 1.3260 area, or the lowest level since August 5.\nThe global risk sentiment gets a strong boost after US President Donald Trump backtracked on his threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports from November 1. This comes on top of expectations that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times this year and concerns about a prolonged US government shutdown, which undermines the safe-haven buck. Furthermore, bets that the Bank of England (BoE) will keep interest rates on hold for the rest of this year benefit the British Pound and act as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair.\nFrom a technical perspective, Friday's breakout through the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the monthly downfall backs the case for additional intraday gains. However, negative oscillators on 4-hour/daily charts make it prudent to wait for some follow-through strength beyond the 38.2% Fibo. retracement level, before placing fresh bullish bets. The GBP/USD pair might then surpass the 1.3400 round figure and climb further towards the 1.3420-1.3425 confluence support \u2013 the 200-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibo. retracement level.\nOn the flip side, the 1.3330-1.3325 region (23.6% Fibo.) now seems to protect the immediate downside ahead of the 1.3300 mark and the multi-month low, around the 1.3260 area touched on Friday. The subsequent fall should pave the way for an extension of a nearly one-month-old downtrend from the 1.3725 zone, or over a two-month peak touched in September, towards the 1.3200 round figure. The latter is closely followed by the very important 200-day SMA, around the 1.3180-1.3175 region, which, if broken decisively, will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders.\nGBP/USD 1-hour chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

Should the data emerge and confirm a cooling in inflation, the Dollar could come under renewed pressure as markets ramp up expectations for further Fed rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, UK data will also play a key role, with investors eyeing the latest labour market and GDP figures for August.\nSigns of further cooling in wage growth or another month of stagnant output could reinforce concerns over the UK\u2019s economic trajectory \u2014 leaving the Pound struggling to recover from recent lows.\nIn contrast, any upside surprise in these reports could lend Sterling brief support, though market caution is likely to persist while fiscal and global uncertainties dominate sentiment."

The Bank of England (BoE) external member Catherine Mann is set to speak later on Monday.

On Sunday, Beijing defended its curbs on exports of rare earth elements and equipment as a response to US aggression but stopped short of imposing new levies on US products. Economic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies could undermine the Greenback and create a tailwind for the major pair.\n\"However, the recent policy moves suggest a wider range of outcomes than was the case ahead of prior U.S.-China talks, with the possibility of greater concessions but also a risk of substantial new export restrictions and higher tariffs, at least temporarily,\u201d said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.\nThe upside for the major pair might be limited as traders expect the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves to raise taxes in the Autumn Statement again to address its ballooning fiscal debt, which is scheduled for late November.

President Trump\u2019s 100% tariff threat reignited trade-war fears and hit commodity currencies hard, though the market reaction suggests traders doubt the escalation will stick. With U.S. data releases frozen by the government shutdown and Australia\u2019s labour market showing fresh cracks, AUD/USD remains vulnerable to downside pressure in the near term.\nView related analysis:\n- Nasdaq, Crude Oil Plunge Amid Trump-Tariff Revival as Gold Holds Firm\n- Japanese Yen Selloff Losing Steam, AUD/JPY and AUD/USD Bears Resurface\n- New Zealand Dollar Sinks After RBNZ\u2019s Dovish 50 bp Cut\n- AUD/USD, NZD/USD and AUD/NZD Outlook Ahead of RBNZ Decision\nTrump\u2019s Tariff Threat, Weak Consumer Sentiment Hits the Australian Dollar\nThe Trump-tariff theme has reared its ugly head once again, sparking a bout of volatility and risk-off sentiment on Friday that saw the Australian dollar fall 1.7% by the close. President Trump threatened China with an additional 100% tariff on its goods in response to Beijing\u2019s newly announced rare-earth export controls. Given the US imports roughly 80% of its rare earths from China, Beijing has struck the US where it hurts.\nWhile the direct impact on Australia is limited, fears of a global slowdown and renewed trade-war tensions tend to weigh on commodity currencies such as the Aussie. Still, the fact that AUD/USD fell only 1.7% suggests markets aren\u2019t taking this round of tariff threats too seriously \u2014 especially with TACO in mind (\u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d).\nEarlier in the week, the Australian dollar was already under pressure as the US dollar extended its bullish run, Wall Street experienced a brief risk-off wobble, and consumer confidence weakened in Australia. According to the Westpac\u2013Melbourne Institute survey, consumer sentiment fell to a six-month low \u2014 down 6.5% over the past two months \u2014 effectively reversing all the optimism gained since the RBA\u2019s last rate cut.\nAUD/USD Implied Volatility Spikes, Risk-Reversals Move Lower\nStill, the 1-week and 1-month annualised implied volatility level rose to a 3-month high on Friday, while AUD/USD endured its worst day since April, just like Wall Street indices. Risk-reversals fell to a 4-month low to show a rise of bearish bets against the Australian dollar. Given the rise of realised and expected volatility, AUD/USD is vulnerable top whipsaws amid US-China headlines this week.\nUltimately, traders may want to remain nimble and investors allow plenty of wriggle room for choppy, two-way trade.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson, Source: LSEG\nUS Economic Data? Not So Fast\u2026\nWe\u2019re now roughly 10 days into the US government shutdown, which makes it longer than usual \u2014 though not as bad as the 35-day shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019. That means the US economic data schedule is shot to pieces. Not only are high-level government releases such as nonfarm payrolls paused indefinitely, but also third-party reports (such as from the Census Bureau) that rely on government inputs to calculate their data series.\nEven if the government were to reopen this week, there will be bottlenecks to clear, and data will be released sporadically. Using history as our guide, weeks two to three after reopening are when we can expect a staggered backfill of data, while weeks four and beyond are when we begin to see data normalisation. Which is a shame because we would have had NFP and CPI data to mull over ahead of this month\u2019s Fed meeting. And the lack of data brings into question as to whether the Fed really can cut.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Investing.com\nAustralian Employment Softens as RBA Weighs Policy Caution\nAustralia\u2019s employment situation continues to lose its shine, with unemployment edging higher and the participation rate appearing to have peaked.

                "body": "The USD/JPY pair trades near 152.05 early in the Asian session on Monday, recovering after previous selling pressure due to US tariff threats against China. China warned of reprisals if the US imposes 100% tariffs, raising concerns over the trade war\u2019s impact.\nTrade Tensions Affecting USD JPY\nTraders await China\u2019s Trade Balance data due later on Monday. US trade tensions and government shutdown concerns could affect the US Dollar against the JPY in the short term, while the reopening of the US federal government is closely monitored.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) potential lack of rate hikes may dampen the JPY. Nonetheless, verbal interventions might limit its decline, especially after Japanese Finance Minister\u2019s warnings about FX market volatility.\nThe JPY\u2019s value is influenced by Japan\u2019s economy, BoJ policy, Japanese and US bond yield differences, and trader sentiment. The BoJ\u2019s historical interventions aim to manage the Yen\u2019s value, often in response to the policy differences with other central banks.\nRecently, the BoJ\u2019s move to unwind its ultra-loose policy supported the Yen. The JPY is regarded as a safe-haven asset, gaining during market stress due to perceived reliability.\nWith USD/JPY hovering around the 152.00 level, we see a major conflict between opposing forces creating significant uncertainty. The threat of new US tariffs on China introduces risk-off sentiment that typically strengthens the Yen, while a potentially more dovish Bank of Japan pulls the currency in the opposite direction. The Cboe/CME FX Yen Volatility Index (JYVIX) has reflected this, recently jumping to 12.5%, indicating traders are pricing in larger price swings.\nStrategy Against USD JPY Volatility\nThe risk of direct intervention from Japanese authorities to strengthen the Yen seems very high at these levels, which should cap the upside for now. We remember the Ministry of Finance stepping in with massive yen-buying operations back in late 2022 when the pair last crossed the 150-152 threshold. Therefore, selling out-of-the-money call options or implementing bear call spreads above 153.50 could be a viable strategy to collect premium while betting that this ceiling will hold.\nOn the other hand, the escalating trade rhetoric from the US creates a serious downside risk for the dollar. Looking back at the 2018-2019 trade disputes, the Yen often found strength during periods of peak tension as investors sought it out as a safe haven. With the VIX closing last week above 19 for the first time in months, buying put options on USD/JPY offers a clear way to hedge against, or profit from, a sharp drop if the trade war fears intensify.\nGiven that the pair could break out strongly in either direction, the elevated volatility suggests that options strategies designed to profit from a large move are appropriate. This environment makes buying both call and put options, known as a long straddle, an attractive strategy for the coming weeks. While the rising currency volatility makes these options more expensive, it also signals the market is bracing for a significant move that could make such a position profitable."

                "body": "Traders should brace for a period of political and monetary policy uncertainty, which may trigger heightened USD/JPY volatility.\nOn Friday, October 10, the long-standing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)\u2013Komeito coalition came to an abrupt end. Japan\u2019s Komeito party withdrew from the more than 20-year coalition following Sanae Takaichi\u2019s win in the LDP election.\nThe collapse of Japan\u2019s coalition could significantly weaken Takaichi\u2019s push for fiscal stimulus and ultra-loose monetary policy to drive economic momentum.\nThe breakup means Takaichi must find sufficient parliamentary support for her key policies, dubbed Sanaenomics. Developments in Tokyo could affect demand for the Japanese yen and USD/JPY price trends.\nCurrently, the LDP holds 196 seats in the Lower House, 37 seats short of the 233 needed for a majority. Without the Komeito party, Takaichi would need support from at least two parties, with the prime ministerial vote potentially as early as Tuesday, October 14.\nFailure to form a majority government could result in a minority government, a heightened period of political uncertainty, and clouding the BoJ rate path. This uncertainty would likely weigh on the yen, sending USD/JPY higher. If Takaichi secures support, her ultra-loose stance may further weaken the yen, creating a challenging scenario in either outcome.\nTraders should closely monitor political developments after last week\u2019s price swings.\nAcross the Pacific, market focus will turn to the US Federal Reserve. The absence of key labor market and inflation data has fueled speculation about October and December Fed rate cuts.\nGrowing support for multiple Fed rate cuts in Q4 could dampen US dollar demand, pushing USD/JPY toward 150. On the other hand, rising concerns about inflation could signal a less dovish Fed rate path, sending USD/JPY toward 155.\nTraders should also watch for Capitol Hill developments, with a vote on a stopgap funding bill, potentially as early as Tuesday, October 14.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: BoJ Uncertainty, US Data, and Dovish Fed Bets\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nBeyond Japan, market attention is also turning to China and Australia, with developments likely to influence the AUD/USD pair.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Chinese economic data will take center stage following President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.\nEconomists forecast Chinese exports to rise 6% year-on-year in September (August: 4.4%) and imports to climb 1.5% (August: +1.3%).\nA stronger export reading could signal rising demand for Chinese goods, which benefits Australia, given that China accounts for roughly one-third of Aussie exports. A pickup in Chinese demand could strengthen trade terms, supporting a less dovish RBA rate path.\nOn the other hand, a lower reading may fuel bets on an RBA rate cut in November and further policy easing in the first half of 2026.\nHowever, US-China trade tensions may overshadow the data. On Friday, October 10, US President Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese shipments. A retaliatory response from Beijing could trigger a flight-to-safety, weighing on the Aussie dollar.\nCrucially, the latest trade policies will take effect on Saturday, November 1, the final day of the APEC Summit. President Trump and President Xi will meet at the APEC Summit, starting on Friday, October 31. The latest moves could be posturing ahead of the highly anticipated meeting between the two presidents.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Chinese economic data and trade developments continue to fuel uncertainty about the RBA\u2019s policy outlook, Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD.\nGrowing support for October and December Fed rate cuts would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrowing rate differential could drive AUD/USD toward $0.655 and the 50-day EMA.\nConversely, calls to delay rate cuts amid tariff and inflati"

                "body": "USD/JPY rebounds above 152.00 on political turmoil in Japan\n- USD/JPY rebounds to around 152.05 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- China warned US of countermeasures if Trump imposes 100% additional tariffs.\n- Dimming hopes for a BoJ rate hike and fiscal concerns could undermine the JPY, but verbal intervention might cap its losses.\nThe USD/JPY pair trades in positive territory near 152.05 during the early Asian session on Monday. The pair recovers some lost ground after facing some selling pressure in the previous session as US President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs against China. Traders will keep an eye on the release of China\u2019s Trade Balance data, which is due later on Monday.\nChina warned the United States (US) that it will retaliate if Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, raising fears of how the trade war will impact the US economy. These remarks came after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose new 100% tariffs on China\u2019s exports to the US.\nThe escalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies, along with the ongoing US government shutdown, could weigh on the Greenback against the JPY in the near term. Traders will closely monitor signs of when the US federal government will reopen and release data that will shape Federal Reserve (Fed) policy.\nOn the other hand, concerns that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may not hike interest rates this year after Sanae Takaichi's surprise victory to lead the ruling party could weigh on the JPY and help limit the pair\u2019s losses. Takaichi's win fueled speculations about more expansionary fiscal policy.\nHowever, some foreign exchange intervention cannot be ruled out after Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday that the Japanese government was concerned about excessive volatility in the FX market.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "USD/CAD struggles near 1.4000 as recovering Oil prices support Loonie amid subdued USD demand\n- USD/CAD remains on the defensive on Monday amid a combination of negative factors.\n- Recovering Crude Oil prices and Friday\u2019s upbeat Canadian jobs data underpin the Loonie.\n- The USD struggles to attract any meaningful buyers and exerts some pressure on the pair.\nThe USD/CAD pair trades with a negative bias for the second straight day on Monday, though it lacks follow-through selling and holds above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) through the Asian session. Spot prices currently hover around the 1.4000 psychological mark and remain well within striking distance of the highest level since April 10, touched on Friday.\nCrude Oil prices open with a bullish gap at the start of a new week and recover a part of last week's slump to a five-month low in reaction to US President Donald Trump's softer tone on the 100% China tariff threat. This helps ease fears of a worsening US-China trade conflict and fuel demand concerns. Apart from this, Friday's better-than-expected Canadian employment report, which showed that the economy added a surprise 60,400 jobs in September, offers some support to the commodity-linked Loonie and acts as a headwind for the USD/CAD pair.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) struggles to attract any meaningful buyers and consolidates Friday's corrective slide as the risk-on impulse undermines demand for safe-haven assets. Apart from this, bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates two more times this year and a prolonged US government closure keep the USD bulls on the defensive. This, in turn, is seen as another factor capping the upside for the USD/CAD pair. However, persistent trade-related uncertainties may deter traders from placing aggressive directional bets.\nFrom a technical perspective, last week's breakout through the 200-day SMA and the 1.4000 psychological mark for the first time since April was seen as a key trigger for the USD/CAD bulls. This, in turn, suggests that any further corrective slide could be seen as a buying opportunity near the 1.3980-1.3975 area (200-day SMA), which should limit the downside near the 1.3940-1.3935 horizontal support. Moreover, relatively thin liquidity on the back of a holiday in the US and Canada warrants some caution amid a mixed fundamental backdrop.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally"

                "body": "Canadian Dollar is holding its ground as one of the month\u2019s best-performing currencies so far, supported by surprisingly strong domestic data despite a slump in oil prices. WTI crude\u2019s drop through 60 last week would normally pressure the Loonie, but September\u2019s upbeat employment figures more than offset that drag.\nThe standout feature of the report was rebound in manufacturing jobs \u2014 the sector\u2019s first monthly gain since January \u2014 signaling renewed momentum in an area hard-hit by global trade tensions. The improvement was particularly welcome after a weak summer stretch that had driven the BoC\u2019s 25bps rate cut in September.\nMarkets are now looking to the October 21 CPI report for confirmation. Inflation would probably need to print well below expectations to confirm the case for another cut on October 29. For now, the data flow leans toward a pause.\nTechnically, EUR/CAD shows early signs of exhaustion after meeting upside target of 61.8% projection 1.4682 to 1.5959 from 1.5598 at 1.6387. Visible bearish divergence on D MACD reinforces the case that upward momentum is fading.\nSustained break below the 55 D EMA (now at 1.6160) should indicate medium term topping at 1.6402. Deeper decline could then be seen to correct whole five-wave rally from 1.4483 (Nov 2024 low), and target 38.2% retracement of 1.4483 to 1.6402 at 1.5669. Nevertheless, strong bounce from 55 D EMA will retain near term bullishness and set up another rally through 1.6402 instead.\nAlso, it should be noted that cross-currency dynamics point to growing downside risk for EUR/CAD. EUR/USD has failed to break through the key 1.2000 cluster resistance and has since retreated from 1.1917. Deeper pullback or even a shift toward bearish reversal could be underway.\nAt the same time, USD/CAD is testing strong cluster resistance near 1.4000, where a corrective dip appears likely after months of steady advance.\nShould both patterns materialize\u2014Euro weakening against Dollar while Loonie strengthens versus the Greenback\u2014EUR/CAD would accelerate its decline, reinforcing the view that a medium-term top is in place. However, sustained strength in USD/CAD or stabilization in EUR/USD would shift the odds away from this bearish case in EUR/CAD."

Spot prices trade just above mid-1.3300s during the Asian session and look to build on Friday's goodish rebound from the 1.3260 area, or the lowest level since August 5.\nThe global risk sentiment gets a strong boost after US President Donald Trump backtracked on his threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports from November 1. This comes on top of expectations that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times this year and concerns about a prolonged US government shutdown, which undermines the safe-haven buck. Furthermore, bets that the Bank of England (BoE) will keep interest rates on hold for the rest of this year benefit the British Pound and act as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair.\nFrom a technical perspective, Friday's breakout through the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the monthly downfall backs the case for additional intraday gains. However, negative oscillators on 4-hour/daily charts make it prudent to wait for some follow-through strength beyond the 38.2% Fibo. retracement level, before placing fresh bullish bets. The GBP/USD pair might then surpass the 1.3400 round figure and climb further towards the 1.3420-1.3425 confluence support \u2013 the 200-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibo. retracement level.\nOn the flip side, the 1.3330-1.3325 region (23.6% Fibo.) now seems to protect the immediate downside ahead of the 1.3300 mark and the multi-month low, around the 1.3260 area touched on Friday. The subsequent fall should pave the way for an extension of a nearly one-month-old downtrend from the 1.3725 zone, or over a two-month peak touched in September, towards the 1.3200 round figure. The latter is closely followed by the very important 200-day SMA, around the 1.3180-1.3175 region, which, if broken decisively, will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders.\nGBP/USD 1-hour chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy"

                "body": "- Crypto ETF Boom: BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has exploded to roughly $90\u201395 billion AUM [1] [2] \u2013 making it the firm\u2019s fastest-growing, most profitable fund. Bitcoin itself recently hit all-time highs (~$125K) in early Oct. 2025 [3], driving massive ETF inflows. Analysts are extremely bullish: Standard Chartered sees BTC at $135K \u201cnear term\u201d (up to $200K in a bull case) and JPMorgan now targets $165K by year-end [4] [5]. Crypto strategist Eric Balchunas (Bloomberg Intelligence) notes IBIT may break into the top-10 U.S. ETFs by 2026 (it\u2019s only \u201cabout $50 billion away\u201d) [6].\n- AI-Themed ETF Surge: BlackRock\u2019s new AI/tech ETF, iShares A.I. Innovation & Tech Active (BAI), launched in Oct 2024 and is up ~33% YTD [7]. It invests in giants like Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft and Meta, and carries a 0.55% fee [8]. Tony Kim, BlackRock\u2019s tech equities head, says these funds help investors \u201cseize outsized and overlooked opportunities across the full stack of AI and advanced technologies\u201d [9]. The rally in AI stocks has buoyed BAI and related funds, echoing broader market enthusiasm for AI.\n- Data-Center Mega-Deals: BlackRock\u2019s infrastructure arm (Global Infrastructure Partners) is negotiating colossal acquisitions in AI energy. Sources report GIP is near a ~$40 billion bid for Aligned Data Centers [10] \u2013 a Texas-based AI data-center company \u2013 one of the largest private data-center deals ever. GIP also already secured regulatory approval to buy utility Allete (~$6.2B) and is in talks to acquire power provider AES Corp for roughly $38\u201340 billion [11] [12]. These moves ensure BlackRock control over land and green power for hyperscale AI clusters.\n- Stock Gains & Analyst Optimism: BlackRock\u2019s stock (NYSE: BLK) is trading near $1,130 (Oct. 12, 2025) \u2013 close to its 52-week high [13]. Despite a slight pullback, BLK is up about +13% in 2025 as investors applaud its new strategic bets [14]. Citigroup just raised its price target to $1,350 (from $1,200) and maintains a Buy rating [15] [16]. \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer added BLK to his watchlist, specifically citing the ~$40B data-center acquisition [17] [18]. In short, analysts now value BlackRock much higher, expecting its AI and crypto ventures to boost future growth [19] [20].\nDeep Dive: BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s largest asset manager (managing ~$12.5 trillion in client assets [21]) \u2013 has staked a huge claim in AI, crypto and energy. In late 2024 it launched two active ETFs focused on AI and tech, calling AI a \u201cmega force with broad investing implications\u201d [22] [23]. Those funds hold leading semiconductor and software companies, capturing the current AI euphoria. Simultaneously, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) capitalizes on the crypto craze. As CoinDesk notes, IBIT \u201chas emerged as the asset manager\u2019s most profitable ETF, with just under $100 billion in assets\u201d less than two years after launch [24].\nThese ETF successes reflect record investor flows into crypto and tech. In the past week of \u201cUptober\u201d frenzy, U.S. spot crypto ETFs saw nearly $5 billion inflows \u2013 over $3.5B into Bitcoin funds alone [25] \u2013 as Bitcoin topped $125K [26]. Bloomberg\u2019s James Butterfill and other analysts point out that this surge \u201chighlights growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty\u201d [27]. Wall Street heavyweights have responded by lifting targets: Morgan Stanley now forecasts $165K Bitcoin by year-end, Standard Chartered eyes $200K if momentum continues [28] [29]. BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink himself has warned that high rates and a weak dollar are pushing investors toward crypto, even suggesting a small BTC allocation for portfolios [30].\nOn the infrastructure side, BlackRock is using its Global Infrastructure Partners platform to lock in AI-related assets. The Aligned Data Centers deal \u2013 reported on Oct. 3 by Reuters \u2013 would give BlackRock control of 78 ultra-high-power data centers (\u223c5 GW capacity) tailored for AI workloads [31].

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.72 billion in net inflows for the week ending Oct 10, led by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with $2.63 billion. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC added $88.9 million, while Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and ARK 21Shares ETF lost just $105 million combined. Those flows prevented a decisive break below the psychological $100,000 support.\nInstitutional Flows Defy Panic as ETFs Hold Nearly 4 % of Supply\nInstitutional appetite remains extraordinary. IBIT now controls roughly 800,000 BTC (\u2248 4 % of circulating supply) and nearly $100 billion AUM, making it the fastest-growing ETF in U.S. history. Total Bitcoin ETF assets stand near $159 billion, representing 7 % of the network\u2019s market value. Monday alone saw $1.21 billion of fresh inflows, the second-largest daily total ever recorded. Even after Trump\u2019s tariff shock, BlackRock logged $74.2 million in new IBIT subscriptions on Friday, signaling deep-pocketed conviction.\nBloomberg\u2019s James Butterfill noted that institutional investors are using every dip to re-enter, betting on Fed easing and dollar weakness.

One of the most promising DeFi jewels among others is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the token that will potentially make an investment valued at $1,000 equal to $1,000,000 during the next bull run.\nMutuum Finance is taking the early promise of open financial access by Ethereum but builds on that through its dual-lending protocol so users can turn on lending as well as borrowing both simultaneously for maximum capital efficiency. The project is presently in Phase 6 of presale, already sold out over 65%, valued only at $0.035, making one of the cheapest high-potential DeFi market entrances. If delivering on its road map and only taking a teaspoonful of Ethereum\u2019s early-stage trajectory, the 1000x potential forecast by theorists is anything but remote from reality.\nEthereum price prediction: Bull target Rebound above $4,585\nEthereum (ETH) is consolidating following the reject at $4,750, currently staying below the level of $4,520. The smart-contract pioneer is trying to stabilize, the first resistance hovering between $4,550 and $4,585, the surmounting above this area the potential pathway to $4,620 and retest $4,750 anew.\nHowever, if bullish momentum will not take the upper hand, ETH will retest the below supports around $4,460 or even around $4,320, the price of $4,150 playing the role of the key defensive floor. The market is still floating on the sensitive equilibrium, the traders observing their eagle eyes strictly above the above levels waiting for the next directional turn. As short-term volatility is tormenting Ethereum, investors are aiming towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an undertaking that is trying to bring ETH\u2019s pioneer spirit but inject fresh efficiencies into the game.\nMutuum Finance Presale Sets History-Breaking Performance\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaking the DeFi circle with Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token, up from Phase 5 by 16.17%. More than 16,860 investors have already invested a total of over $17.25 million so far. Phase 6 is already sold out over 65%, evidencing great hunger from investors as well as global confidence around the project\u2019s future prospects. Early investors will end up making gigantic profits when MUTM will be listed on the open market.\nThe protocol is also scheduled to utilize Chainlinks\u2019 price feeds for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX, fallback oracles, composite data feeds, as well as decentralized exchange TWAPs, for multi-layer coverage as well as accurate valuations even under very volatile market situations.\nMutuum Finance is launching its lending and borrowing protocol , setting the foundation for its DeFi platform. V1 is set to be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. Liquidity will be enabled on launch for ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral, offering an easy-to-use, scalable, secure DeFi experience.\nThe close-order book structure of the protocol holds market risk in check and avoids illiquidity. Close-level terms, liquidation levels, and incentives to the liquidator are finely tuned so that security lending is provided for. Risk-multipliers of the asset class govern stability and firmness even during volatility.\nIt is built upon three pillars of sustainability, trust, and simplicity. The platform is scalable to retail as well as institutional investors so the decentralized finance becomes possible by many more people and provides them with an environment that is efficient, resilient, and secure.\nBest Altcoin to Turn $1, 000 into $1,000,000\nWith Ethereum consolidating, speculators are taking notice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi platform developed with Ethereum-like capability but much better growth potential.

This week, France called on the European Union to give ESMA direct oversight of major crypto firms, urging a stronger regulatory structure under MiCA. The Bank of France Governor, Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, emphasized the need for tighter control over stablecoins and greater supervision of platforms operating across the continent.The move signals a major shift toward consolidated governance across Europe, something that could drastically change how exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and DeFi projects are regulated. The announcement comes as global crypto markets react with mixed sentiment, balancing optimism over institutional adoption with concern about tighter compliance rules.\nIn the midst of this evolving landscape, Ethereum, Chainlink, and BullZilla are emerging as standout projects for investors searching for the next 100x crypto. From established DeFi infrastructure to high-potential presales, this trio captures the full spectrum of innovation and growth potential in 2025's bullish revival.\nBullZilla ($BZIL): The Next 100x Crypto Presale Taking Over 2025\nBullZilla ($BZIL) https://www.bullzilla.com has captured massive investor attention with one of the most explosive presales of 2025. Currently in Stage 6B at a price of $0.00014574, the project has sold over 30 billion tokens and raised $860,000. Its presale mechanism is designed to reward early investors with price surges every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first, creating a dynamic \"mutation mechanism\" that continuously drives growth and scarcity.\nEach stage brings an automatic price increase, and a \"Roar Burn Mechanism\" removes tokens from circulation every time a new chapter is reached. These burns are recorded live on the blockchain, reinforcing transparency and scarcity. The hype surrounding BullZilla has made it a viral contender among meme coin enthusiasts, DeFi investors, and retail traders alike.\nBullZilla's success lies in combining the community energy of meme coins with tokenomics precision normally reserved for blue-chip cryptos. Analysts suggest that the project could see massive upside potential upon exchange listing, making it a clear front-runner in the next 100x crypto conversation.\nThe BullZilla Ecosystem: Utility Beyond the Hype\nUnlike typical meme coins that rely solely on community hype, BullZilla is building a multi-utility ecosystem. Its roadmap includes the ZillaVerse, an immersive Web3 platform integrating NFTs, staking rewards, and gamified engagement for token holders. This ecosystem not only sustains token demand but also encourages long-term holding, reducing the likelihood of post-launch dumps.\nFurthermore, the Roar Burn mechanism ensures token deflation, while the Mutation Engine drives continuous market movement. This blend of tokenomics innovation and community engagement has placed BullZilla at the center of discussions surrounding the next 100x crypto phenomenon.\nHow to Buy BullZilla ($BZIL) in the Presale\nBuying into the BullZilla presale is simple and designed for both newcomers and experienced traders. Investors can visit the official BullZilla website and connect their MetaMask or WalletConnect-compatible wallet. $BZIL tokens can be purchased using BNB, ETH, or USDT, with immediate transaction confirmation on the blockchain.\nOnce the presale concludes, tokens will be automatically distributed to participant wallets prior to official exchange listings. With the next stage price surge expected soon, joining early is crucial to secure the next 100x crypto opportunity before the price jumps again.\nEthereum: The DeFi Giant Powering the Next Wave of Web3\nEthereum continues to dominate the decentralized finance (DeFi)"

                "body": "Dubai, UAE, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a market where many token launches rely on brief bursts of speculative hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking a more disciplined path. The Ethereum-based DeFi project has surpassed $17 million in funding, reflecting accelerating investor interest as it combines a clear token pricing model with visible development progress. With Phase 6 of the presale more than 60% sold out, attention is now turning to the next price step, which will coincide with the project\u2019s upcoming testnet rollout and eventual mainnet launch.\nA Utility-Driven Protocol With Dual Lending Markets\nMutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built to create efficient on-chain credit markets where token value is tied directly to platform usage rather than speculation. Its architecture revolves around a dual lending model that blends two complementary mechanisms.\nThe Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model powers mainstream lending activity. Users can supply assets such as ETH and USDT into shared liquidity pools and receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens automatically accrue yield generated by borrowers, functioning similarly to aTokens during Aave\u2019s early growth. For example, a $10,000 ETH deposit could potentially earn an average annual yield of around 15%, generating passive income while the user retains ownership of their assets.\nOn the borrowing side, users can select variable or stable interest rates. Variable rates adjust dynamically with pool utilization, remaining low under moderate demand but increasing sharply as usage approaches 90% to attract new deposits and balance liquidity. Stable rates provide predictable repayment terms, though they can be rebalanced if they diverge too far from market conditions.\nCollateral management relies on clear Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation thresholds to maintain solvency. Stable assets like ETH and USDT typically support LTVs up to 75%, with liquidation thresholds around 80%, while more volatile tokens have stricter limits to mitigate risk. This layered approach gives both lenders and borrowers flexibility within a secure framework.\nTransparent Presale Structure and Expanding Community Tools\nMutuum Finance\u2019s presale model has played a central role in its steady rise. Each stage offers a fixed number of tokens at a set price. Once sold out, the next stage begins at roughly 20% higher, rewarding early buyers and creating a transparent price progression.\nThe token launched at $0.01 in Phase 1 and now sits at $0.035 in Phase 6, a 250% increase for early participants. With Phase 7 set to raise the price to $0.04 and the final listing price locked at $0.06, investors have a clear view of potential upside as the sale progresses.\nTo date, the presale has raised more than $17 million, allocated over 750 million tokens, and attracted 16,800+ investors. A real-time dashboard allows participants to connect wallets, track purchases, and calculate projected returns. A Top 50 leaderboard highlights major contributors, rewarding them with bonus MUTM at launch and adding a competitive edge to participation. These tools reinforce transparency while keeping engagement high as later stages approach.\nDevelopment Roadmap and Community Initiatives\nMutuum Finance is pairing strong fundraising momentum with clear development milestones. According to a recent team update on X, Version 1 (V1) of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This rollout will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, a liquidator bot, and initial support for ETH and USDT. Unlike many presales that raise capital long before delivering a product, Mutuum Finance is aligning its technical development with its fundraising timeline, building investor confidence that utility will be available shortly after listing.\nCommunity engagement has also been a major pillar of the rollout. A $100,000 giveaway will reward ten participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. Together wi"

                "body": "Solana (SOL) is still a top buy among investors as the cryptocurrency cements itself within the bullish continuation pattern, threatening the ability to make one other big price ascent. However, while Solana\u2019s momentum shines so bright, investors are questioning how high the rally will be able to reach, specifically as new projects are already promising much larger potential upsurges.\nNone is better compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the DeFi rising-star project presale currently under Phase 6, valued only at $0.035. The DeFi dual-lending protocol platform presented by Mutuum Finance gives users the capability to gain yields under a safer, streamlined ecosystem. With an estimated $1 potential growth by 2026 by the experts, early investors believe MUTM is the next-gen DeFi token capable of rivaling, if not surging past, Solana\u2019s early growth curve.\nSolana Eyes the Next Move Up to $300\nSolana (SOL) seems to be riding on past glory having finished a five-wave upswing from the September lows opting instead for the onset of healthy corrective correction. Presently commentators are speculating on two probable outcomes, namely SOL runs into the $214\u2013$208 buying area only to reel off later toward the subsequent rally leg, or ends early and takes off straight into the subsequent rally leg.\nIn either case, market configuration is bullish for continued movement to the bullish side, with analysts speculating on a breakout that will ultimately take SOL up to the $300 level sometime in the next few weeks.\nBut for investors aiming for diversification into promising projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), one emerging DeFi performer is making strong strides.\nMutuum Finance Presale Hype Gains Steam\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, up by a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,860 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 60% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment.\nA second cushion is offered by the shape of the reserve multiplier configuration, itself apportioned from 10% for small risk projects to 35% for high risk projects. The configuration underpins system resilience, dampens liquidation shocks, and insulates capital integrity.\nEven the collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health.\nReal-Time Data Through Chainlink Oracles\nFor precise, stable pricing alongside risk calculation, Mutuum Finance is making use of Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, advanced data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPs guarantee the valuation from the protocol remains precise even during record-record volatility or illiquid conditions.\nMutuum\u2019s lending and borrowing protocol is soon expected to go live. Version 1 (V1) is slated to come out on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have key components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot.\nETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem.\nWhereas Solana (SOL) is plotting a bullish continuation chart to $300, investors are setting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even larger potential. At only $0.035 during Phase 6 of presale, more than 65% of the tokens have been sold so far, generating $17.25 million from more than 16,860 investors.

                "body": "Solana price rebounded above $190 as rising DEX trading activity and surging derivatives open interest signal renewed bullish momentum.\nSolana (SOL) price rebounded 3% on Sunday, October 8, reaching intraday highs of $190 and reclaiming its $100 billion market cap for the first time since early September. The recovery follows a week of volatility triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed tariffs on China, which sparked record-breaking liquidations across global crypto markets.\nSolana Price Rebounds Above $190 as DEX Activity Hits Record $8B\nDespite the broader downturn, Solana\u2019s decentralized ecosystem showed exceptional strength. On Saturday, Solana news aggregator data revealed that perpetual DEXs on the Solana network processed over $8 billion in trading volume during the market crash.\nNotably, four Solana-based exchanges crossed $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume, led by Orca ($2.49B), Meteora ($1.7B), and Raydium ($1.5B).\n\ud83d\udccaReport: During last night\u2019s massive liquidation event, @Solana DEXs processed over $8B in trading volume with @orca_so leading at $2.49B. Four Solana DEXs crossed $1B in 24-hour volume. pic.twitter.com/BJlG9Epth7\n\u2014 SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) October 11, 2025\nWhile the broader crypto market saw liquidity outflows, Solana\u2019s DEX ecosystem retained and recycled capital, keeping network value locked within the chain. Increased transactional intensity during high-volatility periods often enhances validator fees and token burn activity, which may contribute to SOL\u2019s price stability and faster rebound relative to rival layer-1 assets on Sunday.\nDerivatives trading also echoes optimism around Solana\u2019s rebound prospects. Coinglass data shows that Solana open interest surged 6.9% to $10.2 billion on Sunday, even as prices only rose 5% to $192. This divergence suggests new long positions are being opened faster than spot demand, implying leveraged traders re-entry new positions after record-break forced liquidations on Friday.\nSolana Price Forecast: Can SOL Sustain Momentum Above $200?\nSolana\u2019s technical indicators align with improving on-chain and derivatives data, suggesting that bulls are gradually regaining control. As seen below, Solana price bounced off the lower Bollinger Band support at $181.6, confirming renewed buying interest after the market-wide sell-off.\nSOL price has since reclaimed ground toward the mid-Bollinger level at $213.3, which now acts as the next key resistance zone. A decisive breakout above this midline could open the door toward the upper band at $244.9, aligning with the August swing high and serving as a key target for bulls this week.\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen modestly from oversold levels near 41.1 toward the neutral 49.7 mark, signaling that downside momentum is cooling. However, on the downside, a rejection from the $213 resistance could trigger a retest of $181 support.\nnext"

Dow Jones futures rose 390 points (0.87%), S&P 500 futures increased 1.30%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 1.77%. This positive sentiment suggests a potential recovery from Friday's significant market selloff, which saw a $2 trillion drop in market valuations. Trump's message emphasized a desire to help China and described tensions as temporary. The US stock market will remain open on October 13 for Columbus Day, while bond markets and banks will be closed.\n*this image is generated using AI for illustrative purposes only.\nUS stock futures rallied sharply following President Trump's conciliatory social media post addressing relations with China, potentially setting the stage for a market rebound after Friday's significant selloff. Additionally, the US stock market will remain open on October 13 during Columbus Day celebrations, while other services will be affected by the federal holiday.\nMarket Movements\nThe positive sentiment in US futures suggests a potential recovery from Friday's market rout, which saw approximately $2 trillion wiped from market valuations.\nTrump's Reconciliatory Message\nPresident Trump's latest social media post attempted to ease tensions with China, stating:\n- \"Don't worry about China!

While most altcoins crumbled, Remittix (RTX) https://remittix.io showed resilience. With over $27.3 million raised and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, Remittix is proof that real-world utility can weather even the worst market storms.FTSE 100 Holds Steady Despite Market Pressure\nFTSE 100 is valued at about 9,427 GBP, although it is currently declining following a record high of 9,549 on October 8. In spite of this pullback, the general structure is still bullish. According to analysts, buyers will re-enter the market when the index trades over 9,466, but will aim to sell to resistance levels 9,550, 9,566, and 9,580 GBP. Any long-term decline under 9,466 may lead to a temporary decline, but the overall trend is positive over the next week. Although more mature markets, such as the FTSE 100, have indicated maturity and slower growth, demand for digital assets is still growing.\nChainlink Price Prediction\nLINK is currently trading at $16.9, dropping over 20%. However, despite this drop, its volume increased by 323.51% to reach $4 billion indicating traders are getting more interested. The bear force is still high and the technical resistance of LINK is at $19.80. https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/369434479 The RSI stands at 32.71 and the negative MACD shows that the downward trend is established, and there is no sign of the bullish trend.\nStill, while LINK continues to show strength, Remittix has captured headlines https://remittix.io for entirely different reasons.\nRemittix: The DeFi Project Changing Cross-Border Payments\nInvestors talk a lot about \"diversifying,\" but few projects actually hold steady when the market turns. Remittix did. That's the kind of performance that shows the growth from an emerging altcoin to a practical hedge. Adding to its advantages, Remittix has already raised over $27.3 million and sold over 678 million tokens at $0.1130 each. With BitMart and LBank listings already confirmed and another major exchange reveal coming soon, Remittix is quickly establishing itself as a top crypto under $1. https://remittix.io\nHere's why many analysts are calling Remittix the best crypto to buy now: https://remittix.io\n\u25cf Wallet Beta launched with instant crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries\n\u25cf Ranked #1 on CertiK's Pre-Launch leaderboard for verified blockchain projects\n\u25cf Referral program pays 15% in USDT, claimable daily through the dashboard\n\u25cf $250,000 community giveaway campaign driving early adoption and viral growth\n\u25cf It merges DeFi with real-world finance for international payments\nFinal Thoughts\nThe latest market crash exposed the weakness of many tokens, but it also showed that there are some that stood their ground. Among them, Remittix stood tall. While Chainlink might take some time to recover, Remittix's focus on real-world payments and verified trust makes it one of the most viral crypto of the year.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer:\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

The stock has traded flat year to date and is looking for a catalyst as enterprise and government networking spend remains uneven.\nKey themes to watch tonight include how much traction Cisco is seeing in AI-related infrastructure demand, as it competes with hyperscalers and vertical integrators.

Watch live shows and highlights 24/7]\nThat sent Smith-Schuster down to the ground. He jumped back up and went after Branch with a few others as the scuffle escalated. The fracas took officials and coaches a few minutes to sort out.\nThings eventually calmed down and both teams left the field without further issue. Smith-Schuster walked off the field holding a towel to his face, and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said that there is \"pretty good damage\" to his nose.\nThe scuffle is sure to lead to fines from the league, at a minimum, in the coming days.\n\"I did a little childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it,\" Branch said after the game, via The Athletic\u2019s Colton Pouncy. \"They be trying to bully me out there.\n\u201cI should\u2019ve never did it. It was childish.\"\nBranch said that Smith-Schuster specifically hit him in the back at one point in the game while trying to make a block, and that it wasn\u2019t called for a penalty.\n\u201cI got blocked in the back illegally, and it was in front of the ref,\u201d Branch said. \u201cThe ref didn't do anything. Just stuff like that. I could've got hurt off of that, but I still should not have done that.\u201d\nThat hit in question came near the end of the fourth quarter, where Branch seemed to be blindsided by Smith-Schuster and knocked to the ground.\nLions head coach Dan Campbell called out Branch after the game, too.\n\"I love Brian Branch,\" Campbell said, \"but what he did is inexcusable. It's not going to be accepted here. It's not what we do, it's not what we're about. I apologized to [head] coach [Andy] Reid and the Chiefs and Schuster. That's not OK. That's not what we do here and it's not going be OK. He knows it and our team knows it. \"\nThe outburst came after the Chiefs surged ahead in the second half to beat the Lions, 30-17, on Sunday night. They took a three-point lead into the locker room at halftime, and then Hollywood Brown scored his first of two second-half touchdowns on KC's first drive of the third quarter to take all momentum away from the Lions.\nMahomes went 22-of-30 passing for 257 yards with three touchdowns and ran for another score in the win for the Chiefs, who now sit at 3-3. Isaiah Pacheco had 51 yards on 12 carries, and Travis Kelce had 78 yards on six catches. Smith-Schuster had 57 yards on three catches.\nJared Goff completed 23 of 29 for 203 yards with two touchdowns for the Lions, who had won four straight games entering Sunday. Jahmyr Gibbs had 65 yards on 17 carries, and Jameson Williams had 66 yards and a score on six catches.\nBranch, now in his third season in the league, had seven total tackles."

It\u2019s getting worse where abortion is banned.\nAll women, but especially pregnant women, are underrepresented in medical research, and the 2022 Dobbs ruling made it harder to test new medications on them. | Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo\nThe uproar over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to discourage pregnant women from taking Tylenol is highlighting a bigger problem: There has never been adequate data on the safety and effectiveness of many drugs during pregnancy, and that data became even harder to gather after the fall of Roe v. Wade.\nMedical experts and women\u2019s health advocates warn that state abortion bans are exacerbating longstanding barriers to including women of reproductive age in drug trials and other health studies, as both scientists and participating women could face new legal consequences if a drug harms a fetus. And without good information about how drugs affect pregnant women, it\u2019s harder to navigate a morass of conflicting messages from the government and medical groups on the safety of everything from painkillers to antidepressants to vaccines.\nTrump administration health officials have pledged \u201cgold-standard science\u201d aimed at testing whether pharmaceutical drugs are safe to take during pregnancy or whether they carry risks to fetuses\u2019 neurological development. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the president\u2019s recent warnings about Tylenol and autism, for instance, stem from a \u201ccommitment\u2026to follow the science and share critical public health information as soon as it becomes available, ensuring families are informed and communities are protected.\u201d\nYet emerging data suggests that kind of scientific evidence is becoming more difficult to obtain in much of the U.S., since women of reproductive age are more hesitant to enroll in studies in states with abortion bans. PRESTO, a federally-funded, non-partisan online database where people attempting to conceive share data with researchers, saw a more than 27 percent drop in participation in states that banned the procedure in the immediate aftermath of Dobbs, the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. There was no change in states with abortion protections.\n\u201cIn the post-Dobbs era, research with pregnant people is even harder and even more difficult ethically and legally, because of concerns about causing any sort of harm to the fetus could implicate potentially fetal personhood laws or abortion laws,\u201d said Allison Whelan, a bioethicist at Georgia State University College of Law who focuses on pregnancy.\nA dozen states have banned abortion at any point in pregnancy since the fall of Roe, while 10 more have bans that kick in somewhere before the point of fetal viability, typically around 22 to 24 weeks. Some of those laws were enacted decades or even more than a century ago \u2014 before women could vote and before ultrasounds were invented \u2014 while others were passed in the leadup to the Dobbs ruling or shortly after. Lawmakers pushing the policies expressed a desire to protect both fetuses and their mothers, who they argue are often coerced into terminating pregnancies.\nSome of those same red state lawmakers amended their bans over the last year after seeing what they characterized as unintended consequences, such as a rise in sepsis and hemorrhaging during delivery documented in Texas. But while they added new carveouts for threats to the health of the mother, they largely blocked bills that would have added exceptions for fetal anomalies, arguing that diagnoses can be wrong and that even if there\u2019s a slim chance of a healthy birth, patients should take it.\nThat means that in 10 states where abortion is prohibited, women whose fetuses develop birth defects \u2014 whether they\u2019re the result of a genetic mutation or exposure to pharmaceuticals \u2014 must travel out of state or carry to term a fetus likely to die shortly aft"

Industrials have benefited from a still-competitive currency, improving domestic growth and a trade deal with the United States, while financials have gained from higher Japanese government bond yields as the Bank of Japan slowly tightens policy.\nCapital Economics expects the BOJ to raise rates more than markets anticipate over the next two years, which could strengthen the yen.\nThough that should not derail the equity rally as big tech firms, industrial exporters and financials are likely to remain resilient, and the central bank\u2019s gradual exit from equity purchases is unlikely to weigh heavily on sentiment.\n\u201cThe outlook there remains bright for industrials as the economy recovers, and for financials as tighter BoJ policy exerts a bit more upward pressure on JGB yields,\u201d the note said.\nShould you invest $1,000 in 8301 right now?\nAsk WarrenAI, our powerful AI financial research assistant.

                "body": "(Oct 13): Japan\u2019s Komeito party has ended its coalition with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, whipsawing the yen in a relatively narrow band and pushing down Nikkei 225 futures.\nThis is what analysts and investors had to say on the wider market implications.\n\u201cIncreased political turmoil in Japan is likely to weigh on Japanese assets. Komeito\u2019s exit increases the likelihood of outcomes where a larger fiscal expansion is more likely, which should weigh on JGBs and the JPY.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d see the JPY rally as being short-term and unsustainable, with JPY and JPY assets more likely to sell-off on the uncertainty. In addition, given the increased political and policy uncertainty, the BOJ might err on the side of caution and pause in October, awaiting more clarity.\u201d\n\u201cSince Takaichi was chosen, stocks had risen, driven by hopes, and some of those gains may now be unwound. With the US government shutdown dragging on and several negative factors overlapping, the Nikkei 225 could fall toward the 45,000 level.\u201d\n\u201cPolicies that Takaichi originally advocated may become even more difficult to push through the Diet, and in the worst-case scenario, there is even a possibility that she might not be appointed as prime minister \u2014 a scenario that markets may have started to factor in.\u201d\n\u201cIn general, political instability is negative for the country\u2019s currency. But in this case, because the yen has been sold on expectations of Takaichi\u2019s policy, there will be rewinding of that trade. Likewise bonds will be bought back and stocks will fall.\u201d\n\u201cI would suspect that the LDP will reach out to DPP and Japan Innovation Party even though they may not form a coalition government immediately. So the next government will be a bit fragile and it probably means another election has become more likely.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be hard for the BOJ to raise interest rates when there is a political chaos like this. Its rate hike will have to wait either until December or January.\u201d\n\u201cWe see JGBs undergoing another bout of volatility when the market reopens next week to reflect the concerns about fiscal policy under an even less stable government, and the yen could rebound modestly as the widespread expectation for Takaichi\u2019s dovish influence on the BOJ policy is recalibrated to incorporate the latest political developments.\u201d\n\u201cWe note, however, that the opposition remains a highly fragmented group and is unlikely to produce a clear economic policy vision that provides directional cues for FX, bond, and equity investors. Expansionary fiscal policy and less dovish monetary policy would not alter our view of the Japanese equities\u2019 underlying fundamentals that are more micro-driven, and we maintain our preference for Japanese equities. But a period of directionless environment is possible for the market while political parties sort out the governance framework with or without the LDP.\u201c\n\u201cThe earlier slump in the yen this week was due to perceived policies associated with PM-to-be Takaichi while markets pushed back on the BOJ hike normalization timeline. Now that they have lost their long-time partner, Komeito, this suggests she may not be able to push through some of her policies as swiftly, and that the earlier slump in the yen may pare back. Some pullback towards 151.60 or 151 is not ruled out in the interim.\u201d\n\u201cI think concerns about this hit the equity market today, but there\u2019s probably further selling to come. I would expect a sell-off on Tuesday, unless the LDP can swap Komeito for Ishin or DPP in the next couple of days.\u201d\n\u201cThis new uncertainty will weigh on Japan equities. The LDP will have to make concessions which might lead to a weakening of the PM designate Takaichi\u2019s economic policy.\u201d\n\u201cI remain confident on Japan equities but we will see some pullback until their is more clarity on the leadership side.\u201d"
